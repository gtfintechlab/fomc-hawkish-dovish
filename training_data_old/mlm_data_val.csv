"Retail energy prices fell in July, led by a drop in gasoline prices after large gains in a number of earlier months."
"The central tendency of their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2002 was 2-1/2 to 3 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002, while their forecasts of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were centered on 6 to 6-1/4 percent."
Measures of house prices softened again in December and January.
"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, reflecting declines from the inflation rate last year largely stemming from the projected reductions in energy prices."
The case for a larger 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate focused on the desirability of a relatively forceful policy move that would be more likely to promote a strengthening economic expansion and at the same time provide greater assurance of countering any significant disinflation.
"Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
"The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was also revised up slightly, reflecting a small reduction in fiscal restraint from the recent federal budget agreement, which the staff assumed would be enacted; a lower anticipated trajectory for longer-term interest rates; and higher paths for equity values and home prices."
"At its meeting on August 10, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1Â½ percent, and to retain its assessment of balanced risks with respect to sustainable economic growth and price stability."
"Moreover, participants recognized that some lenders might be exposed to additional losses: Delinquency rates on credit card loans, auto loans, and other forms of consumer credit, while still moderate, had increased somewhat, particularly in areas hard hit by house price declines and mortgage defaults."
"With the Committee in the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies and communication, and no additional accommodation being provided at this meeting, a few members indicated that they could support the Committee's decision even though they had not favored recent policy actions."
"Members observed that they saw no indications that the impressive gains in productivity might be moderating and, indeed, the most recent data suggested some further acceleration."
"Recent increases in consumer food and energy prices, together with the small uptick in core consumer price inflation, led the staff to raise its near-term projection for consumer price inflation."
Some members also noted that a possible correction from the currently elevated levels of stock market prices could have adverse effects on consumer sentiment and purchasing power.
Participants noted incoming data suggesting some slowing in the rate of growth of household spending and business fixed investment after strong fourth-quarter readings.
"Factors expected to foster slower growth in key demand sectors of the economy included the buildup of large stocks of business equipment, housing units, and durable goods by households and an assumption that the stock market would play a more neutral role than in recent years."
Several indexes indicated that house prices declined substantially over the 12 months through August.
"Labor earnings rose in the second quarter, but increases in consumer prices offset much of the gain in nominal income."
"Exports have supported U. S. growth so far this year; however, some participants noted risks to the export picture from economic weakness in Europe or from a more significant slowdown in the pace of expansion in China and emerging Asia."
"Against the longer-term inflation risks inherent in the current stance of policy, the members weighed the possibility that the expansion could be relatively subdued for a time, damping prices further and failing to reduce margins of underutilized resources."
"The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down a little, as some of the recent weakness in household spending and income was carried forward in the projection."
Most participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced.
"Reliable, comprehensive data were not yet available on recent house price movements, but the rate of appreciation appeared to be moderating and was likely to slow further in coming months."
"And while the members could see an increased risk of a marked slowing of growth relative to the rapid rate of expansion of the economy's potential, the degree to which growth in demand might remain sufficiently damped to contain and offset those inflation pressures was quite uncertain."
Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
"Even so, most members thought that inflation likely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any strengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual, allowing the Committee to respond in a timely manner."
"A number of indicators of job openings and hiring plans improved in October and November, and initial claims for unemployment insurance trended steadily lower through November and early December."
"Among the various categories of household spending, participants noted that motor vehicle sales remained particularly strong, albeit with some support from price discounting and other incentives."
"Global equity prices generally increased further, credit spreads on corporate debt and emerging market bonds narrowed, and yields on Treasury securities rose somewhat."
"Even so, many participants expressed the view that cautious business sentiment, together with low industrial utilization rates, was likely to keep new capital spending subdued until firms became more confident about the durability of increases in demand."
"Aside from measurement problems, a possible explanation was that these differing trends largely related to the lagged adjustment of employment to the slowing pace of expansion."
"To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances 1/4 percentage point, to 1 percent, effective March 16, 2017."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
"Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to climb briskly, with the advance over the last four quarters being the largest since 1973."
"Moreover, faster increases in energy and food prices could contribute to higher overall inflation, both directly and by boosting inflationary expectations, and the proposed increase in the minimum wage would add to cost pressures if it were enacted into law."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
"With stable long-run inflation expectations and substantial slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would remain subdued in 2012 and 2013."
"Participants generally judged that there was still substantial slack in the labor market, though estimates of the degree of slack were admittedly imprecise and depended in part on judgments about a number of factors, including the extent to which labor force participation would increase as the recovery progresses and employment expands."
"While the Committee could not commit itself to a particular policy course over time, many of the members referred to the likelihood that the Committee would want to keep policy accommodative for a longer period than had been the practice in past periods of accelerating economic activity."
"Broad-based gains in durable goods industries augmented manufacturing employment, and employment in the related industries of temporary help services and wholesale trade increased as well."
"The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised down a little, mainly because of a slower-than-expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second quarter and a downward revision to the forecast for energy price inflation in the second half of this year."
"The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down."
The narrowing of the trade deficit in July also reflected a broad-based decline in imports following their large increase in June.
"Activity in most of the Asian developing economies remained depressed, though there were signs that activity in some was nearing a trough and that growth in China and Taiwan had picked up somewhat."
"Underlying the strength in these key sectors of the economy was the marked improvement in overall financial market conditions since the fall of last year, including the ample availability of financing on relatively favorable terms for many borrowers and the sharp rise in stock market prices."
"Over the course of recent years, accelerating productivity gains had tended to boost aggregate demand by even more than potential aggregate supply owing to the effects of stronger profits on investment spending and, through the rising stock market, on consumption as well."
"Mr. Kashkari also preferred that when data do support a removal of monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC first publish a detailed plan to normalize its balance sheet before proceeding with further increases in the federal funds rate."
"With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index decelerated in the fourth quarter; the slowdown was attributable to wages, which gained only slightly, while benefit costs rose a bit faster than in the third quarter."
The latter included the satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables and fairly elevated levels of consumer debt.
"Market participants took note of the discussion of monetary policy normalization in the minutes and, particularly, the discussion of the likely spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate."
"Following the March FOMC meeting, bank stock prices declined, reportedly on concerns about the potential effects of a flat or inverted yield curve on bank profits; bank stocks subsequently retraced this decline partly in response to strong first-quarter earnings at some of the largest U. S. banks, ending the period a bit higher, on net."
"The level of nominal wages and salaries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised down considerably, and rising consumer prices held down the gains in real disposable income."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is stabilizing."
"Labor market conditions continued to improve and the unemployment rate declined further, although it remained elevated."
"Equity prices for larger banks increased, but stock prices for regional and smaller banks were little changed."
"For the twelve months ended in November, the increase in core consumer prices was a little higher than in the previous twelve-month period, reflecting slightly bigger advances in the prices of both commodities and services."
"Participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent, overall, with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market had changed only slightly since the May FOMC meeting."
"The recent deterioration in labor market conditions was a particular concern for FOMC participants because the prospects for job growth were seen as an important source of uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly in the outlook for consumer spending."
Longer-term yields were likely boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury security issuance as well as some unwinding of safe-haven demands in connection with improved investor sentiment.
"Total PCE inflation was projected to moderate from its current elevated level to between 1-1/2 percent and 2 percent in 2010, although participants stressed that this expected moderation was dependent on food and energy prices flattening out and critically on inflation expectations remaining reasonably well anchored."
"Although the measured increase in productivity might reflect cyclical factors rather than changes in the underlying trend and was subject to data revisions, growth in unit labor costs was expected to continue to be restrained in coming quarters."
"Contacts at communications, technology, and transportation firms indicated that growth had slowed in those sectors; surveys also indicated that growth in the manufacturing sector had weakened during the summer."
"Some sectors, such as trucks and heavy equipment, had experienced rapid growth."
"Although the recent surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time, consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going forward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets."
"Members continued to view the risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside, although with turmoil in the subprime market appearing to have remained relatively well contained and business spending indicators suggesting a more encouraging outlook, these downside risks were judged to have diminished slightly."
"Conditions in financial markets had become somewhat more supportive of growth over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting perceptions of diminished risk of financial dislocations in Europe: Medium- and longer-term interest rates had fallen, some risk spreads had narrowed, and the decline in equity prices that had occurred in the months before the Committee's June meeting had been partly reversed."
"Bank loans, however, continued to contract sharply in all categories, reflecting lack of demand, deterioration in potential borrowers' credit quality, uncertainty about the economic outlook, and banks' concerns about their own capital positions."
"Liquidity in the TIPS market reportedly continued to be poor, complicating inferences about investors' expectations of future inflation."
"It was also pointed out that investors potentially were becoming more comfortable locking in current yields in an environment in which low interest rates were expected to persist, rather than engaging in the type of speculative behavior that could pose financial stability concerns."
"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff."
"Inflation continued to run below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy imported goods."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and develop- ments in the economy and financial markets."
Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that moderate economic growth had resumed following a pause late last year.
"Broad equity price indexes extended earlier increases, yields on longer-term Treasury securities rose, yield spreads on corporate bonds declined, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar increased."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to increase, on balance, in the first quarter of 2012, and broader indicators of manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that suggested moderate growth in production in the near term."
Available information suggested that demand and production in this sector were likely to remain relatively subdued over the coming months.
"Some participants viewed risks to the downside for real GDP growth as having decreased, partly because prospects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, had diminished."
"Labor market conditions improved further over October and November, although employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year."
"However, the rate of increase in payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020."
Members concurred that the statement should note that the expansion remained solid despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions.
"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and monetary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommodative than expected."
"This might imply a more gradual path of tightening going forward than that of the last several months, as for example now seemed to be built into the term structure of interest rates, or it might mean that the Committee on occasion would need to firm policy more rapidly."
"Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"Consumer price inflation was up somewhat on balance in April and May, boosted by a sharp increase in energy prices; improving productivity has held down increases in unit labor costs despite very tight labor markets."
Ongoing investor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its current account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting pressure on the dollar.
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the continuing exceptional performance of the economy, including widespread indications of strength in business activity and subdued inflation."
"The external sector was projected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period, even though an anticipated firming of economic activity abroad would bolster demand for U. S. exports."
"Some participants commented on other possible tools for adding policy accommodation, including a reduction in the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances."
"Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been a little faster than the staff had expected in December, and the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was projected to be essentially the same as in the fourth quarter."
The unemployment rate decreased to 9.
Both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in August and early September.
"In any event, actual inflation data--apart from food and energy prices--and many of the usual early warning signs of mounting price pressures did not yet indicate a pickup in the underlying trend of prices."
"However, the recent declines in energy prices were likely to restrain energy extraction as well as activity in associated energy-producing sectors."
"The staff's medium-term projection for real GDP growth also was revised up, mostly reflecting the monetary policy actions announced by the FOMC after the September meeting and the resulting improved outlook for financial conditions."
The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate.
"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
"The staff's near-term projection for inflation was revised down from the forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, reflecting a greater-than-expected drop in consumer energy prices."
"Reflecting the moderation in growth from the first half of the year, total payroll employment was trending up at a somewhat slower pace."
The limited information available suggested that the change in inventory investment would be positive in the third quarter after subtracting substantially from real GDP growth in the second quarter.
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"Members anticipated that economic data over the upcoming intermeeting period would show significant weakness in economic activity, and some suggested that additional policy easing could well be appropriate at future meetings."
"Indeed, measured productivity in noncorporate businesses--largely services--had displayed a negative trend for many years."
"While exports were likely to continue to advance, the value of U. S. imports was expected to rise as well, implying continued very large current account deficits."
"At its January meeting, the Bank of Japan restated its monetary policy framework, replacing its inflation goal of 1 percent with an inflation target of 2 percent, and announced it would commence a program of asset purchases in January 2014 with no predetermined limit on the maximum amount ultimately purchased."
"Some easing of credit conditions for households, particularly for auto loans, also appeared to be supporting growth in consumer spending."
"The employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier."
"At that time, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation."
"Participants generally saw the data and anecdotal evidence as indicating moderate growth in demands for goods and services, although with substantial variation across sectors."
The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
Some members also stressed the persistence of strong competition in numerous markets that tended to preclude or restrain raising prices.
"The velocity of M3 was projected to continue to decline at a somewhat faster rate than historical experience would indicate, reflecting the greater use by business firms of institution-only money market funds as a cash management tool and the needs of depository institutions for appreciable non-M2 funding to finance brisk loan growth."
Accommodative monetary policy was likely providing important support to these developments.
"Forecasts of growth in business earnings and spending continued to be revised down, and until that process ended, weakness in demand seemed to be the main threat to satisfactory economic performance."
Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
Share prices in U. S. equity markets remained volatile but posted substantial increases on balance over the intermeeting period.
"Evidence suggested that sizable shifts in the longer-run inflation expectations of households and firms had influenced the evolution of inflation over previous decades; in contrast, the anchoring of inflation expectations in recent years likely had damped somewhat the response of actual inflation to the recent economic downturn and to fluctuations in the prices of energy and other commodities."
"The recovery in the housing market slowed in the second half of 2009, even though a number of factors supported housing demand."
"Recent increases in the prices of imports and commodities showed through to a pickup in core consumer price inflation during the first quarter, although some of the categories that registered large gains had posted unusually small increases earlier."
"The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerâterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed on net.
"The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. """
Overall U. S. consumer prices were flat in April and then fell in May as consumer energy prices declined considerably in both months.
Several indexes indicated that house prices continued to decline rapidly.
"In discussing the FOMC announcement for this meeting and going forward, several members commented that policy actions would likely become increasingly dependent on incoming data and their implications for future activity and prices."
"Some members also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in productivity, costs, and prices continued to raise questions about the strength and timing of any pickup in inflation."
A large rise in terms of the yen occurred in response to an easing of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan that reduced the overnight call rate to an extremely low level and fostered a considerable decline in Japanese bond yields.
"The reduction in real disposable incomes caused by large increases in consumer energy prices was also anticipated to restrain consumer spending, with business contacts indicating that retail outlets that typically serve lower- and middle-income households could see particular weakness."
"Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace.
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
Mr. Plosser felt that the reference to 2013 might well be misinterpreted as suggesting that monetary policy was no longer contingent on how the economic outlook evolved.
"Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
"Rising energy prices pushed up total PCE price inflation in March, while the twelve-month increase in core PCE prices was just slightly above its year-earlier pace."
"With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015."
"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2006 and 2007, conditioned on the participants' views of the appropriate path for monetary policy."
"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that no changes to the Committee's asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting."
"Recent information indicated that economic growth in the euro area and the United Kingdom in the first quarter was at about the reduced pace seen in the fourth quarter, and growth likely stayed relatively slow more recently."
"However, the dealers' expected levels of various employment and inflation indicators at the time of liftoff did not change materially from the previous survey."
"Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in conjunction with moderating economic growth."
"As noted previously, the behavior of oil prices was one highly uncertain source of potentially greater inflation pressures."
"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way."
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
"The general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early October."
"Also, the continued fall in home prices and declines in equity prices were weighing on household wealth, with a depressing effect on spending."
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years.
"Also, some participants were concerned that Federal Reserve purchases of longer-term Treasury securities might be seen as an indication that the Federal Reserve was responding to a fiscal objective rather than its statutory mandate, thus reducing the Federal Reserve's credibility regarding long-run price stability."
"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection."
"Broad equity price indexes were a little lower, on balance, as gains following the September FOMC meeting and generally better-than-expected economic data releases were more than offset by concerns about corporate profitability."
"The recovery of oil production in Canada boosted economic activity there, and a pickup in U. S. economic activity and strong household spending in Mexico supported a sharp rebound in Mexican GDP growth."
"Therefore, when there is a significant increase in the projected average growth rate in real GDP, money growth ranges should be adjusted upward so that they remain consistent with price stability."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
"The unemployment rate was forecast to remain flat over the remainder of this year and then to gradually decline through the end of 2019; over this period, the unemployment rate was projected to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate."
"Household spending was supported by strong growth in real disposable income in September and October, and households' net worth was bolstered by recent gains in home values."
"In addition, productivity growth had slowed appreciably in the most recent quarter and unit labor costs had increased, raising questions about cost pressures going forward."
"In other markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, reportedly reflecting strong demands for financing from dealers associated with large Treasury auction net settlements on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year-end for reporting purposes."
Bankers again reported gradual improvements in credit quality and generally weak loan demand.
"Currency growth strengthened, with indicators suggesting strong demand from abroad."
"6 percent in December, as the effects of the earlier declines in consumer energy prices waned."
"In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat."
"Higher energy costs pushed up the producer price index in June, but core producer prices ticked down for the month, leaving them slightly below their levels twelve months prior."
"The staff saw the uncertainty around its projection for inflation as about average, and it viewed the risks to the inflation outlook as roughly balanced."
"The staff anticipated that brisk increases in energy prices would raise total consumer price inflation above core inflation this year, but that upward pressure from energy prices would wane by next year."
"According to the August employment report, private payroll employment fell by a bit more than the average seen earlier this year."
"Factors cited in this regard included large increases in prices of energy and intermediate materials, both of which appeared to be passing through at least in part to core consumer prices."
"In response to a further downward surprise in the unemployment rate, the staff again lowered its forecast for the unemployment rate over the projection period."
"A couple of participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity."
Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee's 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated.
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the November 2-3 meeting indicated that the economic recovery proceeded at a modest rate in recent months, with only a gradual improvement in labor market conditions, and was accompanied by a continued low rate of inflation."
"The subcommittee on communications recommended an approach for incorporating information about participants' projections of appropriate future monetary policy into the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which the FOMC releases four times each year."
"European currencies weakened in response to disappointing data on economic activity, with inflation concerns seen as constraining countervailing monetary easing actions."
"In preparation for the mid-year monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2001 and 2002."
"Moreover, several of them worried about the declines in measures of inflation compensation and in some survey-based measures of inflation expectations and suggested that monetary policy may need to remain accommodative for some time in order to move inflation closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis."
"In December and early January, survey measures of households' long-term inflation expectations stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time."
"In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed at this meeting the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt ranges that it had established in February for 1999 and it set tentative ranges for those aggregates for 2000."
"4 percent in June, the unemployment rate fell to 6."
Several reported that the scarcity of available workers was limiting the growth of economic activity in some parts of the country and that some employers were trying out novel approaches aimed at enticing people not currently seeking a job to enter the work force.
"A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
"A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year."
"The changes were a response to the lower prices of oil and other commodities, the appreciation of the dollar, and the greater amount of economic slack in the forecast."
"Although the increase in food prices slowed in March relative to earlier in the year, energy prices rose sharply."
Typical regional reports referred to slowing increases in economic activity from an already reduced pace or to the persistence of sluggish business activity and generally downbeat business sentiment.
"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2."
Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
"Nearly all the members anticipated a small decline in the rate of inflation in 1997, as measured by the consumer price index, from that recorded in 1996."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting."
"In contrast, equity prices for agency mortgage real estate investment trusts declined, reflecting the rise in longer-term interest rates, the underperformance of agency MBS, and weaker-than-expected earnings reports."
"7 percent in December, the unemployment rate remained close to levels that most participants judged to be consistent with the Committee's maximum-employment objective."
"In Mr. Kashkari's view, while employment growth remained strong, wage growth had not picked up and inflation remained notably below the Committee's 2 percent target."
Recent indicators of foreign economic activity suggested that growth abroad had slowed appreciably after midyear.
"While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth."
"Unemployment edged up further in May, to 6."
"At the same time, prices for core goods and services moved up slightly."
"Some participants suggested that inflation, while low, was unlikely to slow further, pointing to core, trimmed mean, or sticky-price inflation measures as indicative of fairly steady underlying price trends; most measures of wage gains were also steady."
"However, near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved down a little in May and early June from the high level seen in April, and longer-term inflation expectations remained within the range that has generally prevailed over the preceding few years."
"In particular, low implied volatility in equity, currency, and fixed-income markets as well as signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some participants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy."
Spending on high-tech equipment and software also improved as exceptionally strong growth in expenditures for communications equipment more than compensated for fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and on software.
"The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged back up in the preliminary reading for September, and the median expectation for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged down."
Several members judged that the subdued tone of some incoming indicators meant that the downside risks to economic growth in the near term had increased a little and become a bit more broadly based than previously thought.
"Averaging through fluctuations associated with the recent hurricanes, job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined further."
Participants noted that elevated uncertainty about employment prospects continued to weigh on consumption spending.
"Following the announcement, spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and on agency MBS narrowed, while share prices for their common and preferred stock fell."
"Regarding the outlook for inflation, participants generally anticipated that inflation would remain for some time below levels judged to be most consistent, over the longer run, with maximum employment and price stability."
"With resource utilization high and rising, consumer price inflation, as measured by the CPI excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the index, was forecast to increase slightly this year in the context of some further pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would include another legislated rise in the federal minimum wage."
"Consumer prices picked up in August and September, primarily reflecting sharp increases in retail gasoline prices."
"In addition, some market participants pointed to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in connection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate."

"By contrast, the euro-area economy continued its recovery, and real GDP growth in Japan increased sharply."
The U. S. international trade deficit declined in August to its lowest level since February as imports fell more than exports.
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the near term was revised up relative to the previous projection."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the April 28-29 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) only edged up in the first quarter, with growth likely held down, in part, by transitory factors."
The near-term outlook for farm income remained weak despite recent increases in the futures prices of some agricultural commodities.
"Looking ahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over coming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members referred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer and somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number of retailer contacts."
"Despite some signs of improvement of late, the available indicators pointed to continued weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
"Moreover, advances in domestic income were expected to contribute to brisk growth in imports."
"European financial markets remained resilient following the Brexit vote, and European bank equity prices increased on net."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that labor market conditions had improved further even as growth in economic activity had appeared to slow."
The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.
"With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
"Because the members saw the potential need for some tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, perhaps in the relatively near term, the directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period."
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
"In general, participants saw the upside and downside risks to the outlook for economic growth as roughly balanced."
The information on economic activity since the September meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economy's potential.
"Though rapid advances in underlying productivity were expected to continue, the adjustments to stocks of capital, consumer goods, and inventories to more sustainable levels were only partly completed, and financial markets remained unsettled."
"One participant stressed that the Committee could use the full range of its tools, including forward guidance, to further improve the alignment of the medium-term outlook for employment and inflation with its longer-term goals."
The projection for total inflation in 2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices.
Subpar expansion in the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.

"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"Moreover, the prospects of reduced growth in profits and a less ebullient stock market could also be expected to damp business fixed investment."
"Inflation had increased since earlier this year but was still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"Participants noted that financial conditions appeared to have been supported by the recent fiscal agreement, a perceived reduction in the risk that the debt ceiling would not be raised in a timely manner, accommodative monetary policy, and actions taken by European authorities."
"Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has been growing at a moderate rate, paced by brisk, albeit slowing, increases in spending by businesses and households, while expansion in overall economic activity has continued to be restrained by developments abroad."
"With regard to the labor market, participants noted that incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in employment was under way."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
The dollar's appreciation against the German mark and other Western European currencies appeared to reflect market perceptions that the prospects for monetary tightening had ebbed in those countries in light of the persistence of subdued inflation and indications that the continuing financial turmoil in Asian and other emerging economies was likely to have a retarding effect on the economies of the industrial countries.
"Recent readings on core inflation had improved somewhat, although participants noted that some of that improvement probably reflected transitory factors."
"Some thought that continuing to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS, as under the current balance sheet normalization plan, would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large declines in long-term interest rates caused agency MBS prepayment speeds to increase sharply."
"Headline inflation across the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) generally appeared to moderate from the pace registered over the first quarter, as the effects of earlier increases in energy prices started to fade; core inflation continued to be subdued in many AFEs."
"To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November."
"Real GDP contracted in Canada, where lower oil prices depressed investment, and in Brazil, where business and consumer confidence weakened and high inflation prompted a significant tightening of monetary policy."
"The Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term."
Rising equity prices likely resulted in some further improvement in net worth over the same period.
"The staff expected both total and core PCE price inflation to be just a touch below 2 percent in 2018, with total inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in consumer energy prices."
"The recent performance of the CPI and industrial commodity prices and the more numerous anecdotal reports of price and cost increases were reasons for added caution about the outlook for inflation, though these developments still constituted only very tentative evidence of a possible change in inflation trends."
"In the euro area, data on industrial production and retail sales were consistent with robust growth in real activity."
"Even so, it was clear on the basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more generally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight labor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation."
"The Committee's press statement, with its language indicating that the Committee remained uncertain about the extent and timing of the strengthening of final demand, was viewed by market participants as expressing less confidence in the strength of the recovery than had been expected, and yields on Treasury securities declined slightly in response."
"The statement announcing the policy decision noted that economic growth appeared to have been moderate during the first half of the year, despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector."
The Committee expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization.

Most broad indexes of stock market prices rose somewhat over the period since the June meeting.
The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.
"For most of the period, market participants seemed heartened by European leaders' efforts to address the fiscal and financial challenges present in the euro area, although the news late in the period on a possible Greek referendum sent stock prices down sharply."
"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low."
"This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1."
"Still, considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate extent of the housing market correction meant that spillovers to consumption could become more evident, especially if house prices were to decline significantly."
"Inflation readings available since the April meeting continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and continued decreases in prices of non-energy imports."
"Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of slack in labor and product markets and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year."
"On the positive side, continuing gains in consumer incomes and a high level of consumer confidence could be expected to foster sustained growth in such spending, albeit probably at a pace below recent trends."
"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months."
"They pointed to the encouraging tone of recent data on economic growth abroad, which suggested some upside risks to foreign economic activity."
"He noted that most measures of current inflation remain low, and he saw few signs of inflation in the pipeline."
"Households still faced considerable headwinds, including tight credit, high levels of debt, uncertain job prospects, and wealth levels that remained relatively low despite the recent rise in equity prices and stabilization in house prices."
Labor productivity growth remained slow over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of 2016.
"Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise considerably over the year ahead in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year."
"Even so, the data indicated solid growth in business spending on high-tech equipment in recent months."
"On balance, most other short-term market interest rates declined slightly, and intermediate- and long-term rates fell somewhat more, over the intermeeting period."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, a number of members noted that the outlook for production and employment had improved distinctly in the period since the March FOMC meeting."
" their discussion of potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy implementation, a topic last discussed at the November 2016 FOMC meeting."
"Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
A key element in the potential impact of fiscal policy was the uncertain outcome of the current effort to eliminate the federal deficit over time.
"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting."
"The limited available information suggested a further weakening of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries in the current quarter, but there were some indications of a possible brightening of the economic outlook in the period ahead despite a sharp decline in business confidence in the aftermath of the September terrorist attacks."
"Consequently, continued rapid growth in the money supply creates the risk that inflation will accelerate and economic imbalances will become protracted."
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) ended its policy of defending the exchange rate floor of 1.
"Investors cited larger-than-expected downward revisions in FOMC participants' assessments of the future path of the policy rate in the Summary of Economic Projections, recent communications suggesting a patient approach to monetary policy, and weaker-than-expected euro-area data releases early in the period among factors that contributed to this decrease."
"In particular, they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal."
"The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
The available trade data suggested that real net exports would make a negative contribution to real U. S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
"However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm."
"Indeed, available data and anecdotal reports from around the country indicated that foreign demand already had improved markedly for some U. S. products."
The Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
"The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, also were volatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those markets."
An asymmetric directive was consistent with their view that the risks clearly were in the direction of excessive demand pressures in the economy and an associated upward trend in inflation.
They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.
"2 After accounting for these factors, the underlying pace of core inflation seemed to be running a little higher than the staff had anticipated."
"Recent rates of core inflation, if they persisted, were seen as higher than consistent with price stability, and participants underscored the importance of ensuring a moderation in inflation."
"The available information indicated that, on average, economic expansion in the foreign industrial countries slowed appreciably in the third quarter from the elevated pace during the first half of the year and that the slowdown importantly reflected little or no growth in Japan."
The dollar was down considerably against the mark as data suggesting a pickup in German economic activity and inflation led to market speculation concerning a possible increase in short-term German interest rates.
"Against this backdrop, members judged that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected continued to outweigh other policy concerns."
"The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
"In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to slow toward, but to remain above, the rate of growth of potential output."
The rapid growth of M3 was associated not only with the bulge in M2 but also with stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to fund the expansion of bank credit.
"The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
Both near- and longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in February and early March.
"It was further noted that investment flows from abroad could also be contributing to the decline in TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, as such flows tend to be concentrated in nominal Treasury securities rather than inflation-protected securities."
Even the thrust of the current stance of monetary policy as it was transmitted through financial markets was open to some question.
"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1 percent over the 12 months ending in February, partly restrained by declines in consumer energy prices."
Most interest rates declined significantly during the period even though the reduction in the target level for the federal funds rate had been anticipated by market participants.
"That improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households."
"Members cited the resulting lean inventories as a positive element in the outlook for economic activity, given likely efforts by business firms to maintain inventories in broad aligment with anticipated growth over time in final sales."
The staff forecast for inflation was also about unchanged from that at the June meeting.
"Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks."
"At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February."
"In the discussion of inflation in the statement, members decided to reference inflation--meaning overall inflation--rather than underlying inflation or inflation trends, in order to be clear that the Committee's objective is the level of overall inflation in the medium term."
Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose less in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
"If the Committee waited to begin removing accommodation until it was closer to achieving its dual-mandate objectives, it might need to tighten policy abruptly, which could risk disrupting economic activity."
"In addition, demand for credit card loans increased, and a few large banks reported having eased lending policies on such loans."
"Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable, while market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low."
"U. S. equity prices had risen early in the intermeeting period but subsequently declined, ending the period little changed on net; investment-grade corporate bond yields were flat to down slightly and remained at very low levels."
"Foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, with weak economic growth in Japan and Mexico offsetting stronger gains in many other economies."
"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined, on net, in recent months and was somewhat below 2 percent in March."
"However, even these members saw considerable inflation risks should the slowdown in aggregate demand fail to be sustained, and the members generally agreed that for the foreseeable future possible increases in underlying inflation remained the principal risk to the continued good performance of the U. S. economy."
The U. S. international trade deficit widened in August as exports declined and imports rose.
"Outside of motor vehicles, consumption was brisk, supported by job growth, increases in personal income, and the decline in energy prices."
"While firms would seek to maintain those margins, recent experience suggested that this might be accomplished in part through further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters, rather than through more rapid price hikes."
"Participants judged that the potential for more-widespread disruptions in oil production, and thus for a larger jump in energy prices, posed both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation."
"However, members also recognized that in current circumstances, checking upside risks to inflation was important to sustaining good economic performance."
"Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were little changed, in line with MBS yields and other longer-term interest rates."
Housing was seen as another important sector of the economy that was likely to exert a retarding effect on the expansion as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was felt increasingly in housing markets.
"In the United States, equity prices fell, on balance, amid significant volatility, and risk spreads for businesses widened."
"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in October, as a fall in imports was more than offset by a significant decline in exports."
Continuing softness in the expansion of economic activity was mirrored in anecdotal reports of business conditions in much of the nation.
Crude oil prices had moved down since the October meeting amid accumulating inventories and market concerns about a weaker global outlook.
"More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower.
"In looking ahead, meeting participants commented on several considerations pertaining to the course of monetary policy."
"Overall, demand for housing continued to be restrained by tight financing conditions for jumbo and nonprime mortgages."
"At the same time, though, significantly lower energy prices, sustained increases in labor income, and favorable labor market conditions were anticipated to support expansion through the end of the year."
"Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism."
"As a consequence, monetary policy reactions to shifts in economic trends needed in this view to be undertaken more aggressively and completed sooner than in the past."
"Data on consumer expenditures showed particular weakness in June, with either declines or no growth in purchases across most categories of goods and services."
"However, one participant thought that sluggish productivity performance was likely to persist, implying that the recent pace of output growth would be sufficient to maintain employment gains near current rates."
"However, additional evidence of sluggish business investment and recent developments in the subprime mortgage market suggested that the downside risks relative to the expectation of moderate growth had increased in the weeks since the January FOMC meeting."
"Economic growth in most major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the third quarter, and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggested continued above-trend expansion."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Recent production gains remained broadly based across industries, as both foreign demand and a mild restocking of inventories contributed positively to output growth."
"The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites."
"Spillovers from U. S. markets lifted yields and equity prices in most AFEs, but higher yields in the United States seemed to weigh on investor sentiment toward EMEs, where prices of risky assets declined."
"In addition, monetary policy and particularly fiscal policy would also play important roles in supporting business activity."
"However, several noted that in preparing their projections for this meeting, they had taken on board the likelihood that convergence to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective might take somewhat longer than they anticipated earlier."
"The rate of private-sector job openings in February declined slightly from the elevated level that prevailed for much of the past year, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-April was near historically low levels."
GDP growth in foreign industrial economies appeared to have continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
"Moreover, the low level of world oil prices, which appeared to be importantly associated with diminished demand from Asian countries, was retarding production and reducing revenues in the U. S. energy and related industries."
Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subpar in the third quarter.
"The labor force participation rate also decreased, on balance, and the employment-to-population ratio in November was the same as in September."
"In addition, the slowdown of growth in China was noted as a factor restraining economic expansion in a number of countries, and several continuing risks to the international economic outlook were cited, including global disinflationary pressure, tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, and financial uncertainty in Greece."
"The staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was little changed, with the large declines in energy prices since last June still anticipated to lead to a temporary decrease in the 12-month change in total PCE prices in the first half of this year."
"Headline inflation rose further in much of the developing world, largely owing to higher food and energy prices, and several countries continued to face upward pressure on core inflation as well."
"Even in the absence of greater-than-anticipated slowing in the economic expansion, the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated that the relationship between demand pressures on resources and inflation was not following historical patterns, and developments exerting a more lasting moderating effect on inflation, such as more productive capital investment and effective access to spare capacity overseas, could help to contain inflation for some time."
"At the producer level, higher prices for finished energy goods over April and May were partially offset by slightly lower prices for finished foods; prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were little changed over the two-month period and rose less over the twelve months ended in May than in the comparable year-earlier period."
Many participants also noted that core inflation had been running at an undesirably high rate.
"The data on core inflation received during the intermeeting period were favorable, but meeting participants believed that the readings for the past few months likely had been damped by transitory factors and did not provide reliable evidence that the recent level would be sustained."
Participants observed that many foreign central banks had tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period in response to strengthening activity and indications of inflation pressures.
The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
"Low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations were among the important factors underlying their expectation for monetary policy, and members agreed that policy communications would be enhanced by citing these conditions in the policy statement."
"In implementing these temporary operations, the Manager expressed a preference to distribute the System's demand for collateral as broadly as possible in order to minimize the impact on spread relationships in the financing market."
"These were only partial explanations, however, and the members found it very difficult to account for the surprisingly benign behavior of inflation in an economy that had been operating at a level approximating full employment--indeed, possibly somewhat above sustainable full employment in labor markets in the view of a number of members, especially taking into consideration the recent further decline in the unemployment rate."
Weaker exports also restrained economic activity in other emerging Asian economies.
"Looking forward, economic fundamentals appeared to be favorable for continued solid growth, and while fiscal stimulus would abate next year, a flattening out of energy prices, as markets seemed to anticipate, would bolster economic expansion."
"However, it was noted that the unemployment rate and broader measures of unemployment had changed little since the beginning of the year."
"Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline."
Stock prices of financial firms fell sharply in mid-July but subsequently recouped most of those losses.
"Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period."
Several members expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have declined.
Continued brisk import growth appeared likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future by gains in domestic demand.
"Several commented that growth of aggregate demand now appeared to be closer to, and perhaps slightly below, the rate of expansion in the nation's output potential."
"Moreover, members judged that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market had become more nearly balanced, reflecting in part an easing of fiscal policy concerns and an improvement in the prospects for global economic growth."
"Inflation had been subdued, even though the prices of some key commodities had increased recently."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent at this meeting."
They noted that the economic recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipatedâsuggesting greater momentum in economic activity than had been previously thoughtâbut viewed the more recent indicators as signaling that the pace of recovery had slowed.
"In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors."
This action was deemed appropriate in light of incoming information indicating somewhat weaker economic performance than most members had anticipated and the absence of firm evidence that the deceleration in the economic expansion had run its course or that output growth was about to rebound.
"In contrast to the steady expansion of consumer and business investment spending in recent months, several other components of output and demand appeared to have been somewhat weaker than expected."
"Among the few industries that had not been adversely affected were health services, which continued to add workers, and finance, insurance, and real estate, which maintained stable employment on balance."
Foreign economic growth appeared to have improved somewhat in the third quarter following two quarters of slow growth.
"Even so, it was clear that inflationary developments in the economy had become a matter of more urgent concern for monetary policy."
"The pace of economic expansion was forecasted to be sufficient to reduce resource slack over this year and next, although the employment data received over the intermeeting period indicated that this process would begin from a higher rate of unused resources than had been previously expected."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent."
"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained."
"Total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, both increased 1."
"Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some measures of labor force participation increasing further."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
"Business firms had continued to report robust profit margins in a period when competitive pressures generally prevented them from raising their prices, or raising them sufficiently, to pass on the increases that they were experiencing in worker compensation."
"3 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1."
"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"Participants generally agreed that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had risen materially since their May meeting, particularly those associated with ongoing trade negotiations and slowing economic growth abroad."
"The delinquency rate for securitized commercial mortgages continued to climb in May, and indexes of prices of credit default swaps on commercial mortgages declined, on net, over the intermeeting period."
Survey measures of inflation expectations showed no significant change.
"Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, while the labor strike at General Motors was a further drag on Mexico's already weak economy."
"However, survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices were about flat in early October."
"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the September 12-13 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate pace in recent months.
"The near-term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with residual seasonality in the data."
The projections for both 1996 and 1997 were based on individual views concerning what would be an appropriate monetary policy over the projection horizon.
Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters.
"In the medium term, the recovery in economic activity was expected to receive support from accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in financial conditions, and greater household and business confidence."
"As a result, resource slack was anticipated to decline steadily, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in the previous projection, and the unemployment rate was expected to gradually improve and to be at the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in 2017."
"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"The 12-month change in overall consumer prices was close to the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in recent months; excluding food and energy, consumer prices declined in March, and the 12-month change in core consumer prices remained somewhat below 2 percent."
"It was noted that although it was generally appropriate for monetary policy not to respond substantially to temporary shocks to inflation, that prescription depended in part on the assumption that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
"These downside risks included a larger-than-expected drag on household and business spending from higher energy prices, continued fiscal strains in Europe, larger-than-anticipated effects from supply disruptions in the aftermath of the disaster in Japan, continuing fiscal adjustments at all levels of government in the United States, financial disruptions that would be associated with a failure to increase the federal debt limit, and the possibility that the economic weakness in the first quarter was signaling less underlying momentum going forward."
"Most participants expected that the unemployment rate would edge below their estimates of its longer-run level in the coming year and then stabilize for a time, with the further strengthening of the labor market helping move inflation higher."
Participants agreed that the Committee's focus continued to be on providing appropriate monetary accommodation to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability and so judged that additional discussion regarding policy normalization should be deferred.
"Over the 12 months ending in June, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was about 2-1/4 percent."
"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter."
"Broad stock price indexes in major advanced foreign economies rose, although generally somewhat less than those in the United States."
"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
"In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct possibility."
"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
"However, a number of participants noted that investment in equipment and software had been strengthening, and they relayed anecdotal information from their business contacts that suggested continued growth in orders for capital equipment."
"Many participants observed that, at the national level, most measures of nominal wage growth had risen and were currently at levels that were broadly in line with trends in productivity growth and inflation."
"Many participants discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices over the past few months, with several of them citing it as contributing to an easing of financial conditions."
Continued gains in employment were thought likely to provide additional support to spending by bolstering consumer confidence and income.
"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent."
Earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an important factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and a slower pace of economic activity.
"These topics included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation expectations in monetary policy, the best means of conveying the Committee's balanced approach to monetary policy and the symmetry of its inflation goal, the relationship between the Committee's strategy and its decisions about the settings of its policy tools, the implications of the low value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about the values of the neutral policy rate and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, the potential benefits and costs of unemployment running below its longer-run normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures, and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to achieve their dual-mandate goals."
Members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation.
"Factors cited as likely to encourage robust and sustained economic growth included substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, indications of strengthening foreign economies, much improved business earnings and cash flows, and the favorable implications of strongly rising productivity for business investment and worker earnings."
"Most continued to see the risks to real activity and unemployment as nearly balanced, but many acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the downside risks to economic activity somewhat."
"Actual and expected shortfalls in business profitability had led to tighter credit conditions for many borrowers and lower equity prices, which would continue to restrain spending; moreover, further pressure on profit margins, with adverse effects on financial markets, business investment, and consumer spending, was a distinct possibility."
"The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"However, participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in October, as imports decreased more than exports."
"Most participants expected that, following the slowdown in the first quarter, real economic activity would resume expansion at a moderate pace, and that labor market conditions would improve further."
"Market participants had anticipated some tightening of monetary policy at the September 24 meeting, and the announcement of an unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates, with the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield curve."
"By contrast, manufacturing experienced further job losses, and construction employment fell on balance over the March-April period after having expanded briskly since last fall."
"A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately."
"In agriculture, record payouts from crop insurance following last year's drought supported farm incomes, and land prices continued to rise."
"In particular, consumer spending, which had previously provided considerable support to aggregate demand, had slowed sharply in the second quarter."
"Inflation has continued at a moderate pace, though above that in 1998 owing to a sharp rebound in energy prices."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
"On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U. S. economic growth."
"Heavy demand for safe instruments was also apparent in the Treasury bill market, where yields turned negative at times."
"Changes in inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields were mixed; 5-year inflation compensation rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil prices, while the 5-to-10-year measure edged down."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members generally agreed that the expansion in economic activity was likely to be relatively moderate over coming quarters, and that such growth would be consistent with some limited increase in inflation from the current unusually low level."
"Private-sector analysts continued to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over 2017 even as first-quarter earnings, on a seasonally adjusted basis, were estimated to be a bit lower than in the fourth quarter."
"The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP was also revised down a little, reflecting a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar along with slightly smaller projected gains for home prices."
"Amid signs that most firms had worked down their inventories to more comfortable levels, industrial production increased slightly after having declined for nearly a year and a half, and payroll employment appeared to be bottoming out."
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust."
"Going forward, he viewed it as particularly important for the Committee to monitor price developments closely and to adapt its policy in response to incoming economic information."
"In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"Even though the recovery appeared to be continuing and was expected to strengthen gradually over time, most members projected that economic slack would continue to be quite elevated for some time, with inflation remaining below rates that would be consistent in the longer run with the Federal Reserve's dual objectives."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
"This increase was somewhat slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) slowed to 1."
"They recognized that the relationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance were subject to substantial uncertainty, but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis in July 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion consistent with the central tendency of members' current forecasts of nominal GDP growth for 1996."
"Moreover, earlier increases in energy and food prices likely would imply higher headline inflation in the next few months, and past declines in the dollar would put upward pressure on import prices."
"Hurricane Sandy was expected to weigh on economic growth in the current quarter, but rebuilding could provide some temporary impetus early in 2013."
"The increases in the interest rate offered by the Federal Reserve in its ON RRP exercise, along with the increases in caps for individual bids, also may have contributed to higher levels of activity at daily operations."
"Housing demand was, of course, responding to many of the same factors that were affecting consumer spending, including the negative wealth effects of declining stock market prices."
"At the same time, the persistence of very strong competitive pressures, including those arising from foreign competitors, was preventing most business firms from passing on higher costs by raising prices, and this lack of pricing power did not appear to be diminishing."
Retail sales weakened somewhat over June and July following several months of robust growth.
Falling energy prices and widespread discounting of goods held down consumer price inflation.
"The strengthening economy had reduced concerns of significant further disinflation, but those concerns had not been eliminated."
"The unemployment rate moved down in June from its level earlier in the year, and was unchanged in July, as declining civilian employment was accompanied by decreases in labor force participation."
The average monthly increase in payroll employment through the first four months of this year was well below the relatively strong pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.
This approach had been adopted partly as a result of the substantial unreliability of the linkage between the growth of the broad monetary aggregates and economic performance.
"In addition, rising rents had been boosting the cost of shelter and so contributing to the increase in core inflation."
"Moreover, excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices rose slightly less in the twelve months ended in November than in the previous twelve-month period."
"Accommodative financial conditions, fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead."
"After a strong rebound in the third quarter, foreign economic growth appeared to slow sharply in recent months."
"The current momentum of the expansion, together with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable business and consumer sentiment, suggested that economic growth was likely to be well maintained, especially over the nearer term."
"In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent."
"A number of members expected that, on balance, inflation might be less favorable next year, though any deterioration in underlying trends should be relatively limited; others anticipated little change in and possibly some further ebbing of price inflation, extending the subdued behavior of a number of comprehensive measures of prices."
"The rate of private-sector job openings rose in March and stayed at that elevated level in April; the rate of quits edged up, on net, over those two months; and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through early June."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U. S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was projected to bounce back in the second quarter from its weak first-quarter reading."
The U. S. deficit on trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October from its average for the third quarter.
"At the producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core finished goods component declined further in December."
"The rates of private-sector job openings and quits were little changed at relatively high levels in September and October, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in early December."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
"Net exports, while subject to a great deal of uncertainty, were seen as likely to continue to restrain demand and production to a substantial extent over coming quarters."
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, but this partly reflected earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."
"Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"Import growth was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting both higher prices and quantities; other categories of imports fell on balance."
"Core consumer price inflation remained at a relatively subdued pace in August and September; and with energy prices having moderated over the past year, total consumer price inflation had moved down, on a year-over-year basis, to the slower pace of its core component."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response."
"The unemployment rate was at her estimate of its longer-run normal level, and labor market conditions were projected to tighten further."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to adjust the statement to make it clear that underlying inflation had been running below levels that the Committee judged to be consistent with its mandate for maximum employment and price stability, in part to help anchor inflation expectations."
"A number of weaker-than-expected U. S. economic data releases, including the March employment report, also pushed interest rates lower."
He also believed that the view that real interest rates currently were high was not confirmed by observed behavior.
"In contrast, indicators for emerging Asia, including China, suggested that economic growth picked up in the second quarter."
"Given that the balance of risks was seen as pointing to rising inflation over time, the members agreed that it was desirable to retain the tilt toward restraint in the directive."
"On average, private nonfarm payroll employment in November and December rose at only about half of the average pace seen from July to October."
"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead."
"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack."
"Warm weather boosted housing construction in January and February, although sales of new homes dropped back and house prices decelerated slightly."
"Moreover, participants generally made only modest changes to their forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
Household spending is rising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.
"Gains in nominal income, partly resulting from gradual increases in employment, were expected to continue to support consumer spending and low interest rates to buoy residential investment."
Update from Subcommittee on Communications Governor Clarida reported on the progress of the review of the Federal Reserve's strategic framework for monetary policy.
"Foreign inflation fell in recent months, largely reflecting a significant drag from lower oil prices."
The employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 2.
A couple of members emphasized that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessments of the appropriate timing of further policy firming.
"The rate of private-sector job openings moved up in March and held steady in April, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through early June was near historically low levels."
Staff described several feasible strategies for using these six tools to support a gradual return toward a more normal stance of monetary policy: (1) using one or more of the tools to progressively reduce the supply of reserve balances--which rose to an exceptionally high level as a consequence of the expansion of the Federal Reserve's liquidity and lending facilities and subsequent large-scale asset purchases during the financial crisis--before raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate; (2) increasing the IOER rate in line with an increase in the federal funds rate target and concurrently using one or more tools to reduce the supply of reserve balances; and (3) raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate and using reserve draining tools only if the federal funds rate did not increase in line with the Committee's target.
Consumer prices jumped in February as energy prices surged.
"While appreciable further growth could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their operations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other types of equipment was likely to be sluggish."
"Immediately following the May FOMC meeting, nominal Treasury yields rose at short and intermediate maturities, reportedly reflecting the response of investors to a passage in the postmeeting statement indicating the Committee's view that the slowing in real GDP growth during the first quarter was likely to be transitory."
"Participants pointed to a number of factors, other than the gradual rise of the federal funds rate, that could contribute to a reduction in the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields, including a reduction in investors' estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate; lower longer-term inflation expectations; or a lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to historical experience reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases."
"Broad price indexes for U. S. equities rose moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period, prompted by generally better-than-expected readings on economic activity released early in the period, somewhat reduced concerns about the situation in Europe, and some additional anticipation of monetary policy easing later in the period."
"Private nonfarm employment rose modestly in September, boosted in part by the return of communications workers who were on strike in August."
"Nonetheless, as in the June projection, inflation was projected to step down in the second half of this year and to remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years."
"The statistical and anecdotal information provided evidence of increasingly tight labor markets that under similar conditions historically had been associated with considerable upward pressure on nominal labor compensation and, in turn, on prices."
"In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring."
They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.
"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. """
"Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish."
"After falling sharply in August and early September, foreign equity prices rose, with stocks in the euro area outperforming those in most other economies."
Participants discussed a number of policy tools that the Committee might employ if it decided to provide additional monetary accommodation to support a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
"[Return to top] At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity recently has moderated somewhat."
In these circumstances insufficient monetary policy stimulus would risk a more extended contraction of the economy and possibly even downward pressures on prices that could be difficult to counter with the current federal funds rate already quite low.
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"That said, reports from business contacts in many Districts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with some firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
"Some of the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected an increase in inflation expectations, but an improvement in liquidity in the market for Treasury inflation-protected securities and mortgage-related hedging flows may have boosted inflation compensation as well."
"Core prices were boosted in part by an acceleration in shelter costs, especially those imputed for owner-occupied residences."
"During the intermeeting period, broad U. S. equity price indexes declined considerably, on net, amid somewhat elevated day-to-day volatility."
"If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations."
"Industrial production continued to drop through February, employment declined substantially, and retail sales were weak."
"Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a solid pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit was roughly flat."
"Although it was uncertain how long the current period of below-par growth would persist, the economic outlook remained subject to upside as well as downside risks."
"These included: a slackening in world economic expansion that, in conjunction with the appreciation of the dollar, would substantially restrain U. S. exports; some moderation of the growth in household and business investment; and a diminution in the desired rate of inventory accumulation."
Equity prices and interest rates fell noticeably after the announcement of higher tariffs on Chinese imports in early May and then again after news that tariffs might be imposed on Mexican imports.
"With growth of the economy expected to recover, meeting participants were concerned that price pressures, which had been elevated before the storm, could climb further, primarily as a result of additional increases in energy prices."
The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.
"Other participants, however, thought that inflation was unlikely to fall appreciably further given the stability of inflation expectations in recent years and very accommodative monetary policy."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace."
"In their review of developments across the nation, the Federal Reserve Bank presidents reported modest growth in most major areas of the country."
"In addition, the surging prices of technology-related equities might have spurred depositors to shift some of their M2 balances into equity mutual funds."
Mr. Fisher agreed that the Committee should be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
"With inflation running persistently below its longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be appropriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations would remain well anchored at 2 percent."
"Many members held that a case could be made for moving to a balanced risk assessment with regard to the outlook for inflation, with a number of them expressing a marginal preference for such a change."
"Most participants judged that, in the absence of significant economic or financial shocks, raising the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate if incoming information confirmed that economic growth had picked up, that job gains were continuing at a pace sufficient to sustain progress toward the Committee's maximum-employment objective, and that inflation was likely to rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
"On a 12âmonth basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
"Real disposable personal income was bolstered by gains in employment and falling retail energy prices, while continued brisk advances in house prices and the recent strengthening of equity prices contributed importantly to increases in household wealth."
"In his assessment, maintaining highly accommodative monetary policy in the current economic environment would increase the risk of future imbalances and, over time, cause an increase in longer-term inflation expectations."
"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1."
Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained solid in the face of higher longer-term interest rates.
"Although growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated a little recently, it continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range."
"While noting that households remained cautious, participants cited a number of factors that were likely to continue to underpin gains in household spending, including rising house prices, growing confidence in the sustainability of the economic expansion, increasing payrolls, and the high ratio of household wealth to disposable income."
"Like consumer spending, new home construction and sales had displayed considerable resilience in recent months, apparently in large part as a result of relatively attractive mortgage interest rates and perhaps to some extent as a consequence of favorable weather conditions in many parts of the country."
"However, many participants observed that the Committee should remain attentive to evidence of a possible downward shift in longer-term inflation expectations; some of them noted that if such an outcome occurred, it would be even more worrisome if growth faltered."
"The December employment report showed that job growth had slowed appreciably, and other indicators also pointed to emerging weakness in the labor market in the intermeeting period."
"Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run below the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demonstrate the Committee's commitment to achieve outcomes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time."
"At the producer level, core prices edged down on balance in October and November; moreover, producer inflation eased somewhat on a year-over-year basis, though the deceleration was more than accounted for by an earlier surge in tobacco prices during the year ended in November 1999."
"The Bank of Canada, National Bank of Denmark, Reserve Bank of India, and Central Bank of Turkey also cut policy rates in January to support their economies and, in some cases, to foster higher inflation, while the Central Bank of Brazil raised rates in response to concerns about elevated inflation."
Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
"However, most participants thought that the framework remained valid, notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real GDP growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate."
Many participants noted that it would likely be appropriate in the not-too-distant future to revise the Committee's characterization of the stance of monetary policy in its postmeeting statement.
Output in the manufacturing sector continued to trend higher as firms increased production to meet strengthening final demand and to slow the pace of inventory liquidation.
"In the household sector, the further slowing of the rate of increase of house prices appeared to have continued to weigh on the expansion of mortgage debt in the third quarter."
"The step-up in motor vehicle assemblies boosted employment in that industry; job losses decreased in a number of other manufacturing industries, and factory workweeks generally rose."
"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to reduce the substantial margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2014."
Members emphasized that the Federal Reserve was prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
"The latter contributed to ongoing competitive pressures that severely limited the ability of firms to raise prices, helping to this point to keep inflation at a low level."
Participants raised a number of important considerations about the implications of persistently low inflation for the path of the federal funds rate over the medium run.
"Longer-term inflation expectations had remained reasonably low, helping to restrain the spillover of elevated energy prices to the prices of other goods and services."
"Most longer-term nominal interest rates declined, real interest rates fell even more, credit spreads tightened, and equity prices rose, in part reflecting better-than-expected corporate earnings reports."
The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"The broad dollar index strengthened notably over the period, boosted by safe-haven demand, predominantly against EME currencies, and despite a significant decline in U. S. yields."
"Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation abated further, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices."
"With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against a wide range of currencies, along with the prospective slackening in world economic expansion associated with the Asian turmoil, could be expected to exert a considerable damping effect on U. S. exports over the next several quarters."
"In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth had slowed sharply at the end of 2019, and indicators pointed to only a modest pickup in economic growth early this year."
"Looking forward, however, most members thought that rapid productivity growth and flat or declining energy prices would limit increases in the overall unit costs of businesses."
The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.
"By contrast, economic activity accelerated in Canada in the first quarter."
"Contacts in the banking sector reported that U. S. banks remained willing to lend to qualified customers, but that loan demand was weak."
Participants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in postâWorld War II history.
Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
Views differed to an extent on the outlook for inflation and policy going forward.
"The Asian crises held down exports of the major European countries, partly offsetting the influence of strong domestic demand."
"In that regard, a few cited concerns about rapidly rising prices of CRE, including multifamily properties, or about illiquidity of the assets of some mutual funds."
The Committee agreed that the statement should briefly describe its current projections for unemployment and inflation relative to the levels of those variables that members see as consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
"Participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assessments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook, as informed by a wide range of data."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as exports rose and imports fell.
"The drop in private employment following very large gains in March and April seemed, in the absence of other signs of weakening labor demand, to be attributable at least to some extent to statistical noise and seasonal adjustment problems."
"In that regard, several high frequency indicators of production, labor markets, and private demand suggested greater underlying strength of late than had been reflected in the most recent GDP data."
"Although the unemployment rate was little changed, participants variously cited positive readings from other indicators, including a decline in longer-term unemployment, the low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, the rise in job openings, and survey reports of increased hiring plans and job availability."
Concerns about the possibility of rising inflation persisted.
"In present circumstances, the degree of slack in resources and a rate of inflation that was essentially consistent with price stability suggested that the Committee could wait for more definitive signs that economic expansion would otherwise generate inflationary pressures before making a significant adjustment to its current policy stance."
"Amid the weaker outlook for economic activity over the next year, the unemployment rate was likely to rise significantly into 2010, to a level higher than projected at the time of the October 28-29 FOMC meeting."
"Alternatively, some of the recent weakness in measured productivity growth could reflect a decline in the underlying trend in productivity and so might persist."
"However, members also cited some factors that would tend to restrain the growth in consumer spending."
"Furthermore, inflation pressures continued to be muted, notwithstanding the firming in the overall and core PCE price indexes in the three months ending in June relative to earlier in the year."
Both the accompanying statement and the minutes of the meeting were broadly in line with market expectations and elicited limited price action in financial markets.
Consumer food prices posted further sizable increases in August and September and continued to run well above the change in core prices.
"Finally, inflation expectations appeared to have remained contained despite adverse news about prices."
"Total consumer price inflation moderated in August, reflecting a substantial slowing of the increase in energy prices."
"Several participants suggested that structural factors such as mismatches between unemployed workers' skills and the needs of employers with job openings, or unemployed workers' inability to move to a new locale, were contributing to the elevated level and long average duration of unemployment."
"Members emphasized that because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions, the incoming data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of economic activity and prices, on which the Committee's policy decision must be based."
"In keeping with its usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments."
Indexes of commodity prices rose in March but stayed far below their year-earlier values.
"Real GDP was again expected to increase faster in the second half of this year than in the first half and to expand more rapidly than potential output in 2016 and 2017, even as the normalization of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
"Equity prices were higher, on net, although they declined later in the period."
The staff continued to project inflation to be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half and to remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
"Inflation compensation based on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) rose over the intermeeting period, apparently owing in part to an increase in oil and other commodity prices, while five-year inflation compensation five years ahead was little changed."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April 30-May 1 FOMC meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was little revised from that prepared for the March meeting."
Key factors that influence consumer spending--including solid gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values on households' net worth--continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.
"On balance, U. S. financial conditions remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was little changed, longer-term yields on Treasury securities edged down, equity prices rose, speculative-grade corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly."
"In their discussion of the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, the members indicated that the Committee's risk assessments relating to economic activity and inflation to be referenced in that statement should remain the same as those in use since the May meeting."
Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
"Even so, growth in consumer spending was thought likely to moderate over time to a pace more in line with the expansion in consumer incomes, unless the stock market posted large further increases from current levels."
"By the same token, the rate of price inflation was lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a number of studies of distortions in published price data."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that moderate growth at a pace close to the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation for the year ahead."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged over the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak."
A lower dollar would tend to have a favorable effect on the trade deficit but also would add to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
"In these circumstances, a smaller move than those undertaken earlier this year would have the advantage of reducing the odds on adding to inflation pressures later and of underlining the Committee's assessment of its policy stance."
The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
Growth in household debt was estimated to have edged down in the third quarter because of a slowing in mortgage debt growth but remained elevated.
"Meanwhile, employment in the state and local government sector continued to trend lower."
A number of factors were expected to contribute to the slowing of aggregate demand and reduced pressure on resources.
"The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations edged up, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in November and early December, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years was slightly above its level in October, while the 3âyearâahead measure produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rose a bit in November."
"Inflation for other goods and services also appeared to have moderated, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was about 1-1/4 percent over that same period."
The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low.
"By contrast, the increase in the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve months ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting a pickup in benefit costs."
"Presumably in response to falling retail energy prices, one survey of households in November and early December showed a marked retreat in expectations for inflation over the coming year."
"While monetary policy adjustments ultimately would be data dependent, some participants expressed the view that, in light of their current outlook, it likely would be appropriate to adjust the federal funds rate gradually after the first increase to help ensure that the economy would be able to absorb higher interest rates and that inflation was moving toward the Committee's objective."
"Consistent with strong national data on the labor market, business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
"Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
"In contrast, many others worried about the low level of inflation, and a number indicated that they would be watching closely for signs that the shift down in inflation might persist or that inflation expectations were persistently moving lower."
"The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term."
"However, wage and salary income increased strongly in May, though to a level still below its February value, and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial, leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated."
"Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation."
"By various estimates, underlying inflation trends remained subdued, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were generally viewed as stable."
"The demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low."
Surging growth in China was a highlight of the strong performance of most countries in Asia.
More of the members believed that this language was useful in conveying the Committeeâs sense of the outlook for the economy and the stance of monetary policy and was appropriately conditioned on economic developments.
"Consumer price inflation picked up, reflecting higher consumer energy costs, but longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
Delinquency rates on residential mortgage loans continued to edge down amid robust house price growth and still-tight lending standards for households with low credit scores and hard-to-document incomes.
Participants also discussed plans for publishing operational details regarding the implementation of monetary policy around the time of the first increase in the target range.
"Household surveys indicated that median year-ahead inflation expectations inched down in September and October to about the level observed in the first quarter, and longer-term inflation expectations slipped to their lowest level in two years."
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Despite such welcome developments, members expressed concern about indications of a less benign inflation climate."
It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook for both long-term interest rates and home prices.
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1/4 to 1/2 percent."
"A few countries did show some signs that weakness was abating, perhaps reflecting, in part, rapid implementation of fiscal stimulus; furthermore, the recent firming of commodity prices gave an indication that global weakness might be starting to subside."
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to reaffirm the ranges for growth of M2, M3, and total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established in February for 1999 and to extend these ranges on a tentative basis to 2000."
Survey responses continued to indicate median expectations of headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation above 2 percent and an unemployment rate of around 4 percent at the time of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the attacks of September 11 might well have induced a mild downturn in economic activity after several months of little movement in the level of economic activity.
"Most participants raised their forecast of real GDP growth in 2011 somewhat and continued to anticipate stronger growth this year than in 2010, with a further gradual acceleration during 2012 and 2013."
"In that regard, a number of participants indicated that the recent rise in the participation rate was a positive development, suggesting that a tighter labor market could potentially draw more individuals back into the workforce on a sustained basis without adding to inflationary pressures and thus increase the productive capacity of the economy."
The growth of domestic demand had been met in part through further advances in imports.
The information reviewed at the May meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded at a below-trend pace in recent months.
Members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal.
"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
"Since early August, the equity prices of large U. S. financial institutions fell and their credit default swap (CDS) spreads widened."
"In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants thought that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
The information reviewed at the December meeting pointed to a significant contraction in economic activity in the fourth quarter.
"Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp increase in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large advances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on balance over the three-month period."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
"The recent increase in oil prices and decline in equity prices, along with increased strains in the subprime mortgage sector, were expected to exert some drag on real activity over the remainder of the year."
Participants agreed that the growth in real GDP appeared to reflect a strengthening of private final demand and not just fiscal stimulus and a slower pace of inventory decumulation; this welcome development lessened policymakers' concerns about the economy's ability to maintain a self-sustaining recovery without government support.
"For the year through September, both aggregates recorded growth rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year."
"The 12-month change in overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowed a bit further in April; total consumer price inflation and core inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, were both running somewhat below 2 percent."
"Several other central banks tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period, including those of Chile, India, Indonesia, Sweden, and Thailand."
"However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
"Subsequently, the Chairman's Congressional testimony on monetary policy, which suggested that recent softness in consumer spending should prove short-lived and emphasized the FOMC's commitment to price stability, spurred an upward tilt in the market's expected path of monetary policy."
"However, doubts about the strength of the recovery owing to the tone of the Committee's press statement along with mixed incoming data on final demand, announcements of weaker-than-expected corporate earnings, and heightening tensions in the Middle East prompted declines in yields on short- to intermediate-term Treasury securities."
"Business demand for motor vehicles remained mixed, with fleet sales of light vehicles higher and purchases of medium and heavy trucks somewhat weaker."
"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. """
"They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"By contrast, economic activity in China and other developing countries showed greater buoyancy."
"Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longer-run inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"While underlying inflation remained subdued, meeting participants generally saw only small odds of deflation, given the stability of longer-term inflation expectations and the anticipated recovery in economic activity."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
The staff detailed a possible approach for implementing and communicating monetary policy once the Committee begins to tighten the stance of policy.
"Many participants saw the recent behavior of the prices of food, energy, shelter, and imports as consistent with a stabilization in inflation and judged that the transitory factors that had reduced inflation, such as declines in administered prices for medical services, were fading."
The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels.
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
The Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent at the December meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest rate futures markets.
"In labor markets, however, there were increasing indications of tightness that might at some point feed through to greater inflation."
"Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U. S. economy."
"On balance over the intermeeting period, private interest rates moved up appreciably while Treasury yields increased somewhat less."
"Some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected, with economic growth above its longer-run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year."
"While temporary factors, such as declining oil prices, had played a role in depressing inflation, the persistence of very low inflation under these conditions most likely also resulted from more lasting changes in economic relationships."
"In addition, although the staff did not change its view of the longer-run level of the natural rate of unemployment, it judged that the natural rate was on a more pronounced downward trajectory back toward its longer-run level than previously assumed; as a result, the staff's projection for the unemployment rate over the next two years was revised down a little, relative to its previous forecast."
"To date, the backup in fixed mortgage interest rates in recent months seemed to have had little adverse effect on homebuying, although it was noted that an appreciable further rise in longer-term market rates would represent a potential source of restraint on future household spending."
"In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members continued to view business capital spending as a critical factor in the prospects for the performance of the overall economy."
"In addition, the forecast for headline PCE price inflation incorporated a much higher rate of increase for energy prices for the first half of the year; as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008."
"Available measures of home prices suggested that appreciation had slowed considerably but prices in most areas were not falling, although some sellers were reported to be providing various inducements to potential purchasers that reduced effective prices."
"At the producer level, core prices declined in August, notably at the early stages of processing."
"Excluding the volatile energy component, consumer price inflation slowed somewhat in 1999."
But they were concerned that the high level of resource utilization and slower productivity growth could augment inflation pressures.
"After rising rapidly during the first nine months of the year, producer prices excluding food and energy fell sharply in the last three months of 2008."
"Key factors underlying the members' forecasts of appreciable moderation in the trend of real GDP growth included a waning of the financial stimulus that had boosted domestic demand in recent years and the buildup of stocks of consumer durables, housing, and business equipment after an extended period of rapidly expanding purchases."
"Consumer spending had advanced strongly in late 2013, contributing importantly to the pickup in growth of economic activity."
A small decline in manufacturing jobs roughly offset slightly higher employment in construction.
"While they believed that the economic recovery would continue to be supported by accommodative monetary policy, ongoing improvements in households' and businesses' financial positions, and pent-up demand for goods and services, a number of factors were seen as likely to continue to restrain the pace of economic growth."
Participants discussed the extent to which the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would affect inflation expectations going forward.
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace."
"Because most saw no significant changes in the medium-run outlook, they agreed to continue to indicate that the Committee anticipates a very gradual pickup in economic activity over time and a slow decline in unemployment, with inflation at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
Members noted that the impetus for the economic advance was to a large extent a temporary swing in inventory investment rather than a clear and substantial upswing in final demand.
"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
"With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"Largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding ""new economy"" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years."
Several participants noted that improving growth abroad would likely contribute to greater growth in U. S. exports going forward.
"While the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was a somewhat inhibiting influence on the prospects for housing, favorable factors noted during the meeting included the ongoing effects of the large gains in stock market wealth, sizable increases in employment and incomes, and a still relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership."
"However, several participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be at levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
"It was noted that recent readings on monthly inflation had edged up, and a couple of participants observed that core inflation on a year-over-year basis appeared to be stabilizing."
"Energy prices were moderating noticeably in response to lower worldwide demand, and core price inflation remained subdued."
"Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has remained subdued this year, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices."
"And spot prices for natural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate weather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels; unusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices to move back up to their October levels."
Some members noted that any remaining resource slack would probably exert downward pressure on inflation and that the depreciation of the dollar seemed to be having a muted effect on import prices to date.
Rising energy prices were also damping growth in real incomes.
"Among the developments that would tend to limit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of consumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many households."
"Housing markets continued to exhibit strength across much of the country, with few indications of any moderation except for sales of high-priced homes."
Credit card loan growth showed signs of moderating amid rising interest rates and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks.
"While the outlook for inflation was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of participants projected that inflation would run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective for a significant period before moving moderately above 2 percent for some timeâconsistent with the Committee's revised consensus statement."
The increased reluctance to hold risky assets was associated with a sharp decline in equity prices and a notable widening in risk spreads on corporate bonds.
"Consumer spending was increasing only modestly after large gains earlier, housing activity was down somewhat, and growth of business spending on capital equipment, while still quite vigorous, was slowing a little after a first-quarter surge."
"On a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
"Nevertheless, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with a pickup in real PCE growth in the coming months."
"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members noted that while statistical and anecdotal information pointed to persistently tight labor markets in much of the nation, price inflation remained subdued."
Foreign equity prices generally ended the intermeeting period down.
"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon."
Foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on developments that pointed to the potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending."
"The Committee judged this policy stance to be consistent with its objectives of fostering high employment and sustained low inflation and, over the near term at least, viewed the risks to this outlook as reasonably well balanced."
The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.
"Participants discussed the extent to which the ongoing tightening in fiscal policy was likely to further restrain economic activity in the second half of this year, with one participant noting that the effects of the federal sequestration appeared to be less pronounced than previously anticipated."
"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in December and January, as imports increased more than exports."
"Other participants favored a strategy in which the Committee would soon announce a general schedule for future asset sales, with a date for the initiation of sales that would not necessarily be linked to the increase in the Committee's interest rate target."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1."
"Some participants also pointed to downside risks to the housing market stemming from the large volume of substantial upward interest-rate resets that were likely on subprime mortgages in coming quarters, which could lead to a faster pace of foreclosures in the near term, thereby intensifying the downward pressure on house prices."
"Although this pace was noticeably slower than the average rate during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, many participants viewed it as consistent with continued strengthening in labor market conditions and with a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate."
"Given the projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources and of inflation were not expected to change materially."
"Indeed, some recent survey evidence on such expectations had been troubling, and widening federal deficits were mentioned as a factor that could further stir inflationary concerns."
"Both near- and longer-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were little changed, on balance, in September and October."
"They indicated that their forecasts for economic growth, the labor market, and inflation had changed little over the intermeeting period."
"Consumer spending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business invest- ment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently, and housing demand seemed to have leveled out."
"1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 1."
"Economic activity had remained on a strong upward trend in Canada in recent months, and economic growth picked up during the spring in the United Kingdom after having stagnated over the previous two quarters."
"Participants noted that households were continuing their efforts to repair their balance sheets, a process that was restraining growth in consumer spending."
The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period; the staff's estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.
"Financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further."
"In the circumstances and assuming no changes from current financial conditions, the individual members saw likely prospects for expansion over the forecast horizon at a pace close to, or a little above, the estimated growth of the economy's long-run potential."
"The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable."
"The growth rate of liquid deposits moved up, while small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds continued to contract."
"The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further."
Available indicators suggest that business capital spending decelerated in early 1999 but growth was still relatively rapid.
The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
"Most participants anticipated that inflation was likely to edge lower in the near term, reflecting the decline in oil and other commodity prices and lower import prices."
"They also noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"However, inflation expectations were seen by most participants as well anchored, which would tend to curb any tendency for actual inflation to decline."
"In agriculture, record yields were reported for corn and soybeans, but farm income was being reduced by lower crop prices."
"Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Contacts in the retail sector reported strong demand, and lending to households seemed to be robust."
"The possibility that house prices could decline by more than anticipated, and that the effects of such a decline could be amplified through their impact on financial institutions and financial markets, remained a key source of downside risk to participants' projections for economic growth."
"The drop in housing starts, coupled with lower sales of new and existing homes in June (latest data available), suggested that the rise in mortgage rates was exerting a damping effect on housing demand and homebuilding activity."
"Regarding the economic activity of households, participants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse effects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence."
"Federal receipts had been increasing rapidly, a development that reflected continued strong growth in labor and non-labor income."
"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation."
"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"However, market participants suggested that building expectations that the Committee would move to a form of flexible average inflation targeting under the revised consensus statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation compensation over recent months."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded by less in December than in the previous two months, perhaps partly because of unusually bad weather."
Increases in consumer food prices in October were substantially slower than the average pace in the preceding months of this year.
"Since the available indicators showed that the economy could well be producing in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential and that aggregate demand remained strong, keeping rates unchanged would run an unacceptable risk of rising inflation."
"Labor force participation moved up slightly in recent months, and the unemployment rate, which was unchanged in June, edged down to 5-1/2 percent in July."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
"Nonetheless, the staff continued to expect core inflation to edge lower over the course of the next two years."
"Later in the intermeeting period, yields declined in reaction to the release of weaker-than-expected April CPI data and the somewhat disappointing May employment report."
"Participants agreed that continued stable inflation expectations would be essential to achieving and sustaining a downward trend to inflation, that well-anchored expectations couldn't be taken for granted, and that policymakers would need to continue to watch inflation expectations closely."
"Private nonfarm employment rose at a solid pace in June, as in recent months, while total government employment decreased further."
"With the economy facing continuing headwinds from the recent financial crisis and with growth slowing in a number of U. S. export markets, members generally expected a modest pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually."
Core producer price inflation also declined over the year ending in May.
"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed considerably in February, reflecting a further rise in the value of exports and a sharp drop in the value of imports."
The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad.
The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages remained very low over the intermeeting period.
"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth of economic activity remains brisk."
Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity had picked up in recent quarters.
"In view of the elevated readings on costs and prices, many members thought that the decision to keep policy unchanged at this meeting was a close call and noted that additional firming could well be needed."
"As in previous forecasts, further disinflation was expected to be checked by the ongoing stability of inflation expectations."
"Strong demand from overseas was evidently boosting exports this year by more than the increase in imports, with the nation's external accounts thereby providing a small net positive contribution to growth in domestic production."
The median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey dropped to its historical low of 2.
"Still, most participants thought that, with energy prices possibly leveling out, aggregate demand moderating, and long-term inflation expectations contained, core PCE inflation likely would decline gradually from its recent elevated level, though the upside risks to inflation were significant."
Other measures of longer-run inflation expectations from the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were also unchanged in September.
The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
"Staff Economic Outlook The information on economic activity received since the June FOMC meeting was weaker than the staff had anticipated, and the projection for real GDP growth in the second half of 2011 and in 2012 was marked down notably."
"The members generally viewed a modest decline in inflation as a reasonable prospect, at least for a while."
"A number of members noted their dissatisfaction with the Committee's current approach for communicating its views regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy, and looked forward to considering possible enhancements to the Committee's communications."
"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter- meeting period."
"Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed."
"Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably."
"While the depreciation of the dollar over recent months had been notable, some participants found persuasive the evidence from recent studies pointing to a decline over time and across countries in the pass-through of exchange rate movements into domestic prices."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) conducted in April, the fraction of banks that eased standards on CRE loans over the past three months increased to a relatively high level, while demand for these loans strengthened further."
"Late in the intermeeting period, market participants came to interpret U. S. monetary policy communications as implying high odds of a firming of monetary policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices suggested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than was previously anticipated."
"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins."
The dollar depreciated early in the period following the weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for September and the subsequent downward shift of the expected path for U. S. policy rates.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
Core PCE prices rose 0.
"Increases in most aggregate measures of hourly wages and labor compensation remained subdued, and several participants commented that the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment might be lower than they currently estimated."
The members thought that policy accommodation probably could be removed gradually--a view that had been reinforced by the slower pace of growth and more moderate rates of price increase that had become evident over the intermeeting period.
"Several participants observed that the stimulative effects of fiscal policy would likely diminish over time, while the lagged effects of reductions in monetary policy accommodation would show through more fully, with both factors contributing to their expectation that economic growth would slow to a pace closer to trend."
"By contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies fell only modestly, as several of these economies have government-administered energy prices and some have been experiencing upward price pressures from currency depreciations."
"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics all declined, on net, from March to May; the rate for African Americans was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the rates for other groups."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
"Information from some regions pointed to a pickup in capital investment, although the continued decline in oil prices led business contacts to expect a slowdown in drilling activity and, if prices remain low, reduced capital investment in the oil and gas industries."
"The mixed reports on corporate earnings, incoming information indicating slower growth in economic activity in the United States, and wide swings in and uncertainty about the price of oil contributed to a sharp drop in broad indexes of stock market prices over the period in volatile trading."
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, to 0 to 1/4 percent."
"Moreover, house prices fell by more than anticipated, and conditions in a broad range of debt markets became more restrictive."
"Although some survey evidence suggested that some firms were trimming capital spending plans, participants reported that their business contacts generally were quite positive about the economic outlook and the strength of demand for their products."
"Assessing all these factors, participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and resource utilization remained high."
"Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise."
"Regarding inflation, the recent run-up in consumer energy prices was expected to subside over the next few months, while the effects of the drought were likely to show through to retail food prices."
"Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
"In addition, they saw inflation as likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward more desirable levels."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
"Participants noted that private payroll employment had fallen in February for the third consecutive month, and suggested that increasing concerns among workers about prospects for employment and income likely were holding down consumer outlays."
"Some participants observed that, in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation, they expected real GDP growth to slow over the medium term, moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth."
"Strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending, but modest growth in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures remained muted."
"In addition, even apart from the possibility of further financial contagion in Latin America, the weakness in foreign economies continued to be seen as a persistent source of restraint on demand in a number of domestic sectors, notably manufacturing, agriculture, and some extractive businesses."
"In the end, members agreed to indicate that labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, but that the unemployment rate was little changed and a range of labor market indicators continued to suggest that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources."
Data received since the September FOMC meeting suggested that the global economic and financial developments of late summer had little effect on the medium-term outlook for U. S. growth and inflation.
"For example, if progress toward the Committee's goals proved slower than anticipated, the new guidance relayed the Committee's intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet."
"Among other factors, banks were experiencing unanticipated growth in loans as a result of continuing illiquidity in the market for leveraged loans, persisting problems in the commercial paper market that had sparked draws on back-up lines of credit, and more recently, consolidation of assets of off-balance-sheet affiliates onto banks' balance sheets."
"In circumstances in which inflation was already reasonably low and pressures on resources and prices were likely to abate further in coming months, the risks were quite small that additional monetary stimulus aimed at bolstering the economy would foster a pickup in inflation."
"Although the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories increased appreciably in the first quarter and continued to rise at about the same pace in April, the recent large increases in the book-value data were due importantly to a jump in the price of oil and a run-up in the prices of intermediate materials."
"Unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data, but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year."
"Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while."
"Equity prices were quite volatile during the intermeeting period and, reflecting numerous dour reports on corporate earnings and incoming information indicating slower growth in economic activity in the United States, broad indexes of stock market prices dropped considerably on balance over the intermeeting period."
"Core consumer inflation had moved lower, but overall consumer prices had been pushed up recently by sharp rises in energy prices."
"Even with this action, the federal funds rate would remain below the level that members anticipated would prove necessary to contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential, and thus in all likelihood further policy action would be required."
"The staff's forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index, was revised down marginally for 2017 as a whole after incorporating the soft data on consumer prices for March, but it was essentially unrevised thereafter."
"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased by more than those on nominal securities, and the resulting decline in inflation compensation retraced a substantial share of the rise that had occurred over the preceding intermeeting period."
"A few participants noted that disruptions to the credit intermediation process and the inefficiencies associated with shifts of resources among economic sectors could be expected to reduce aggregate supply as well as restrain aggregate demand; as a consequence, such factors could limit the effect of slower output growth on rates of resource slack and inflation."
"Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation, While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures."
"Yields on Treasury securities dropped somewhat on net over the period, rates on lower-quality bonds rose, and equity prices fell sharply further."
"Although prices of some commodities and imported goods had risen recently, many business contacts reported that they currently had little pricing power and that they anticipated limited, if any, increases in labor costs."
Factors underlying business optimism included robust growth in revenues and profits and the ready availability of both debt and equity financing.
"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
"Nonetheless, the increase in aggregate demand had been exceeding even the now-higher sustainable rate of growth in aggregate supply, as indicated by declines in the pool of available but unemployed workers to a very low level and by the rise in imports."
"The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, also was about 1-1/2 percent over that same period."
"Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity."
"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in February, as imports fell more than exports."
"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed, on net, since the February FOMC meeting."
The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
"While money growth has been rapid by historical standards, market-based indicators of monetary policy suggest sufficient restraint."
Both headline and core consumer price indexes fell in March.
"As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations had remained contained."
The slowing growth of M2 in October and November following strong expansion in August and September apparently reflected the moderating rates of increase in nominal income and spending in recent months and perhaps some persisting effects of the rise in opportunity costs earlier in the year.
"U. S. equity price indexes reached all-time highs, with the largest gains registered in sectors that have underperformed during the pandemic."
Weighing against the risks of higher inflation was the financial turmoil that had intensified in Southeast Asia during October and more recently in Korea.
Asset price movements as well as changes in the expected path for U. S. monetary policy beyond December appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U. S. elections.
Key measures of share prices in equity markets have posted mixed changes over the intermeeting period.
"The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower."
"Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
A few also emphasized the risk to the economic expansion that would be associated with allowing labor market conditions to tighten to an extent that could lead to an unwanted buildup of inflation pressures and thus eventually require a rapid increase in the federal funds rate.
"Going forward, growth in consumption spending was likely to be supported by gains in employment and personal income."
"One was business inventory accumula- tion, which had exceeded the robust growth in final sales in 1997 and probably would moderate this year as business firms sought to restrain the buildup in their inventories to keep them in better alignment with the expected moderation of gains in sales."
The Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.
"Still, a better outlook for house prices was an important input to the improved economic outlook; not only would household wealth benefit from a turnaround in such prices, but the exposure of lenders to real estate losses would be diminished."
"All things considered, the Committee expected the pace of employment gains to improve in coming months."
"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the most recent statistical and anecdotal information provided further evidence of persisting strength in the expansion and of relatively subdued wage and price inflation."
"In that case, monetary policy accommodation might need to be removed more quickly than currently anticipated."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"Readings on the growth of labor costs were revised down for the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006, but recent data suggested a pickup in the second quarter."
"The recent performance of this aggregate likely was associated, at least in part, with the rise in market interest rates earlier in the year that boosted the opportunity cost of holding liquid balances."
"Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"In addition, a major factor underlying the persistence of generally subdued price inflation in a period of robust economic expansion was the continued acceleration in productivity, which clearly was holding down increases in unit production costs."
"In the leveraged loan market, average bid prices rose further and bid-asked spreads were little changed."
"However, several participants noted that with credit quality improving, some bankers were more actively seeking loan growth, though the same bankers also indicated that the demand for loans remained weak."
"Although members saw strains in global financial markets as having eased somewhat, they continued to see an increase in such strains as well as slower global growth and a greater-than-expected fiscal tightening in the United States as downside risks to the economy."
"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. """
"The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term."
"Core consumer price inflation moderated substantially in May and June, though sizable increases in food and energy prices continued to push up overall consumer price inflation."
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical norms."
The staff continued to judge that much of the recent softness in consumer price inflation would be transitory and that inflation would pick up somewhat in the second half of this year.
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"Inflation was projected to change little in 2012, as considerable economic slack was expected to remain even as economic activity was anticipated to strengthen."
"Most participants, however, expected that inflation would remain subdued for some time."
"Foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in India and China, while it remained soft in most AFEs, in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pressures."
"CRE loans on banks' books expanded in the second quarter, consistent with stronger loan demand reported in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)."
"Others expressed concern that economic growth might continue at a pace that could increase pressures on resources, with adverse implications for inflation in an economy already operating in the neighborhood of its estimated long-term potential."
"Most participants anticipated that the housing sector was likely to recover only slowly over time, but a few were more optimistic about the potential for a more rapid housing recovery given reports of stronger demand in some regions and of improved sentiment among builders, as well as signs that recent changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program were contributing to the refinancing of performing high loan-to-value mortgages."
Participants also noted that extending the termination date of these liquidity facilities to October 30 would not rule out the possibility of closing particular facilities sooner if improvements in financial conditions were to indicate they were no longer needed to support credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.
"Some members thought that explicit numerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years would have several important benefits, including enhanced credibility that could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater flexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing policy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation concerns."
"However, the pace of growth appeared to slow in many foreign economies in the second quarter, although in some cases as a result of what were likely to be temporary disruptions, including wildfires in Canada and an earthquake in Japan."
"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter."
"Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation remained low, with five-year, five-year-forward CPI inflation compensation a bit below 2 percent--unchanged from the time of the March FOMC meeting but somewhat above levels registered last year."
"They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
The minutes of FOMC meetings were seen as an important channel for communicating participants' views about monetary policy.
Some participants again warned that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and employment prospects of the unemployed.
"The latest readings on consumer confidence showed a drop in August amid labor market slack and near-record gasoline prices, and a further slight decline in September, but the readings for the third quarter averaged above those for the second quarter."
"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation."
"Excluding these categories, core inflation rose at a relatively subdued rate again in March."
"Regarding the labor market, many members concluded that a range of indicators of labor market conditions--including the unemployment rate as well as a number of other measures of labor utilization--had improved more in recent months than they anticipated earlier."
The decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in nearly three decades underscored anecdotal reports of further tightening in labor markets in recent months and added to concerns about the outlook for inflation.
"In the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff raised its projection for the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) for 2008."
"Labor market conditions improved further in recent months: Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged more than 200, 000 over the period from September to November, and the unemployment rate edged lower."
The Committee reiterated that it will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.
"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap."
Falling exports and inventories subtracted from Canadian output growth.
"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"On balance, recent developments suggested that the course of final sales now had a more positive contour over the forecast horizon and that resource utilization would rise somewhat more than anticipated earlier despite higher projected growth in structural productivity."
"The economy clearly would carry substantial expansionary momentum into the new year, quite possibly in excess of growth in the economy's long-run potential, and the key issue for the Committee was whether growth in aggregate demand would slow to a more sustainable pace without further tightening in the stance of monetary policy."
"However, the three-month change in core prices in December likely was down considerably from its peak in May."
The 12-month change in headline PCE prices increased from 1.
"In these circumstances, substantial further disinflation probably would not materialize, and the need for further reductions in the federal funds rate or unconventional policy measures would thus be obviated."
"Housing demand remained very weak and, although the stock of unsold new single-family homes continued to move down in November, inventories of unsold homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales."
Most participants saw changes in the target for the federal funds rate as the preferred active tool for tightening monetary policy when appropriate.
Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged.
"Several participants noted that a very large portfolio of long-duration assets would, under certain circumstances, expose the Federal Reserve to significant capital losses when these holdings were unwound, but others pointed to offsetting factors and one noted that losses would not impede the effective operation of monetary policy."
"However, concerns were expressed that this rate of growth in consumer expenditures might not be sustainable without the support of a notable pickup in business investment and hiring."
"On a 12-month basis, both inflation measures had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
"Among the factors cited were a persistent decline in the neutral federal funds rate, and depressed term premiums likely owing to the elevated size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as the reduced likelihood of high inflation relative to several decades ago."
"The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that the moderation in economic growth had appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market."
"Additionally, several participants remarked that the public might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being limited."
"Similarly, effects of the drought were expected to show through to retail food prices over the next few quarters but then subside."
Surveyâbased measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"Inflation had been subdued, apart from some temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices."
"In its forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak first-quarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economy's long-run potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008."
"Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged."
"3 trillion over the intermeeting period, driven by growth in securities holdings."
"Consumer price inflation was subdued, and measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"Over much of the period, financial market volatility was relatively low, but volatility increased somewhat in the last couple of weeks of the period amid shifting views among market participants about potential monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks."
The range for growth of total domestic non- financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
"On the other hand, if productivity growth remained weak, the labor market might tighten more quickly and inflation might rise more rapidly than anticipated."
Energy prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year.
"Meeting participants noted that several measures of inflation expectations had changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period and that analysis of the components of price indexes suggested disinflation might be abating."
"However, a couple of participants anticipated that the decline in unemployment would be damped as part-time workers shift to full-time jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the labor force, while a few others commented that they expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor force participation."
"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying."
Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong over the two months ending in February.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
"Over the 2018â20 period, output was forecast to rise at a rate above or at the staff's estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021."
"To be sure, the economy's potential output appeared to be expanding briskly, with much of the impetus provided by accelerating productivity."
"Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable."
"Looking forward, participants agreed that inflationary pressures looked set to moderate further in coming quarters, reflecting recent declines in commodity prices and rising slack in resource markets, and several saw risks that inflation could drop for a time below rates they viewed as most consistent over time with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
"Mr. McTeer does not believe that rapid growth based on new technology, rising productivity, and other supply-side factors is inflationary, especially in the current global environment."
"In Mexico, the effects of fuel price hikes in January and the pass-through from earlier currency depreciation to prices started to wane, but inflation remained above the central bank's target."
A significant number of Committee members reported information from their contacts that businesses were increasingly able to pass on cost increases to their customers and to boost prices more generally.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the September 21 meeting indicated that the pace of the economic expansion slowed in recent months and that inflation remained low.
"In addition, a couple of participants noted the potential usefulness of collecting additional data on wholesale funding markets in order to better understand how changes in interest rates could influence those markets."
"Inflation had been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations had risen, but the Committee expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization."
"Some participants suggested that, at some point, it might become necessary to revise statement language to acknowledge that, in pursuit of the Committee's statutory mandate and consistent with the median of participants' policy rate projections in the SEP, monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activity."
"Factors underlying that assessment included the emergence of less taut conditions in labor markets, relatively low capacity utilization rates in manufacturing, and the persistence of highly competitive conditions in most product markets that made it very difficult for business firms to preserve or increase their profit margins by raising prices."
Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.
"Real GDP growth slowed somewhat less in the first quarter than anticipated at the time of the March meeting, and participants expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary."
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
Market-based measures of inflation expectations decreased over the intermeeting period but remained within their ranges over the past few years.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that the information received since the March meeting provided some tentative evidence that the pace of contraction in real economic activity was starting to diminish."
"Even so, the ongoing adjustment of nonresidential capacity to demand had been substantial in recent quarters and likely would give way to a modest recovery during the year ahead."
"The labor force participation rate rose slightly, as did the employment-to-population ratio."
"The continued sluggishness in consumer expenditures mainly reflected falling employment, sharply lower wealth as a result of earlier steep declines in asset prices, and tight credit conditions."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
"It was noted that the market-based measures had tracked quite closely the movements in crude oil prices over the period, first rising and then falling back."
"In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability."
"Commercial and industrial loans outstanding increased in April and May after being weak in the first quarter, alÂ­though the growth of these loans remained well below the pace seen a year ago."
"This concern aside, Mr. Stern also believed that current circumstances were favorable for policy action to reduce inflation further and thereby help to sustain the ongoing improvement in the economy."
"Consumer price inflation continued to be modest, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits.
"The lagged effects of the rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead."
"Members judged that storm-related disruptions and rebuilding would affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggested that the hurricanes were unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
"In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were roughly equal and that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had declined further so that it was almost equal to that of a rise."
"As a consequence, the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of additional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on prices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy."
"In addition, inflation pressures continued to be muted."
"The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in December and the gains for October and November were revised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter above that for the third quarter."
"Despite high levels of resource utilization, inflation and inflationary expectations had remained subdued to date, reflecting to some extent special influences like the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
Some members noted a mismatch between demand and supply for certain types of labor.
"Consequently, the Committee agreed that the statement should again cite such risks to inflation and explicitly reference the possibility of additional policy firming."
The staff's forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was little changed.
"Investors' concerns about the situation in Europe seemed to ease somewhat, and market participants also appeared to have increased their expectations of additional monetary policy accommodation."
"Although the economy was probably strengthening, a variety of factors could well keep the pace of expansion below the rate of growth of potential for a while, even at the current policy stance."
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"Real incomes were also boosted by the reversal in energy prices, though the negative wealth effects of continued declines in equity and house prices likely offset this somewhat."
"Growth of bank credit in the fourth quarter slowed to about half its pace compared with earlier in the year, as loan growth declined."
"Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing."
Private nonfarm payroll employment continued to fall in April.
"Economic growth remained firm, while rising energy, and possibly labor, costs threatened to put upward pressure on inflation."
"Consumer price inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year, and measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"In addition, some readings on inflation expectations had been low."
"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996."
"However, consumer spending had increased appreciably in the early part of the year, and labor demand continued to expand, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than last year."
The passthrough effects of the substantial decline in energy prices over the past year were a favorable factor in the outlook for core inflation.
Recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"However, given the surge in stock prices in April, much of the lost ground had probably since been made up."
"4 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core CPI inflation was 2."
"Beyond this year, the projection for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged."
"Over the intermeeting period, many investors came to expect that the Committee would reduce the target federal funds rate at its October meeting; in addition, the anticipated policy path further ahead moved down a bit more, on net, over the remainder of the intermeeting period, apparently in response to heightened concerns among investors about economic growth."
"Economic growth continued to be sluggish in many of the major foreign industrial countries, according to the limited information available for the first quarter."
"The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"Share prices of financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in part, of concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits."
The U. S. international trade deficit widened in March and then narrowed in April to a level near its average in the first quarter.
Consumer prices edged higher in January after having been flat in December.
"Still, most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"Rates on longer-term obligations were down somewhat on balance, apparently reflecting a reassessment of the outlook for inflation by some market participants in the light of unexpectedly low inflation and other statistics released during the latter part of the period."
"On balance, generally robust homebuilding activity was expected to persist against the backdrop of low mortgage interest rates and rising household incomes."
Core consumer prices rose a bit more slowly in August than they had in June and July.
"The staff also summarized a set of options for clarifying, for the public, the Committee's longer-run objectives under its dual mandate as well as the Committee's forward guidance about the likely future stance of monetary policy."
The staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year.
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
Participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
"Although global equity price indexes fell abruptly on March 3 amid the deepening of the political crisis in Ukraine, most markets quickly retraced those losses."
"In general, participants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis, alÂ­though a number of participants noted that it was premature to conclude that the Committee had achieved that objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, most members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood that the improvement would be sustained indicated that the Committee could appropriately begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
"For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
"Indicators of labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period, with a further reduction in the unemployment rate, declines in longer-duration unemployment, strong growth in payroll employment, and a low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance."
The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
"Nonetheless, a couple of participants continued to be concerned that the extended period of low inflation might persist and feed through to inflation expectations, citing estimates from various inflation forecasting models and the downtrend in the 10-year CPI projections in the Survey of Professional Forecasters."
"The growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks' books continued to be strong, although a modest net percentage of banks reported tightening standards for C&I loans to large and middle-market firms during the fourth quarter in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS)."
"For the second quarter as a whole, the advance release of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) indicated that real exports of goods and services increased more than real imports, with the result that net exports added significantly to real GDP growth."
The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
The unemployment rate moved down to 13.
"In its medium-term and longer-run projections, the staff slightly lowered its assumptions for potential GDP growth and real equilibrium interest rates."
"Still, looking further ahead, participants continued to expect that, aided by an easing in the stance of monetary policy, economic growth would gradually recover as weakness in the housing sector abated and financial conditions improved, allowing the economy to expand at about its trend rate in 2009."
Many participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year; several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook.
"The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the December 13 meeting indicated that U. S. economic activity expanded moderately despite some apparent slowing in the growth of foreign economies and strains in global financial markets.
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
"The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major foreign currencies index, rose over the intermeeting period as long-term interest rate differentials moved sharply in favor of dollar-denominated assets."
Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook.
"2 trillion, as growth in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in U. S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding."
"For many emerging market economies, the recent slowing in growth of economic activity was most evident in exports, industrial production, and other indicators of manufacturing activity."
"Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
Some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had accounted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years.
"Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."
"Other factors underlying consumer spending also remained favorable: Real wages and salaries continued to rise, and the ratio of wealth to income remained high, although it was down a bit because of a decline in equity prices."
"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
Participants' views of the recent evidence on inflation expectations varied.
"With expansion of aggregate demand less robust, industrial production and employment were rising at appreciably slower rates, though unemployment remained very low."
"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth."
"These reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and other advanced economies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time."
"For the year ended in October, core producer prices rose appreciably more than in the preceding year."
"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up from the projection prepared for the August FOMC meeting, reflecting increases in consumer energy prices that were greater than anticipated."
"The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons increased somewhat and continued to be elevated, while the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down further but remained high."
"Subsequently, however, Treasury yields moved up significantly in response to incoming data suggesting further robust growth in aggregate spending, and then retraced much of the rise after the receipt of favorable news on inflation."
Members generally judged that continuing the maturity extension program would put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
"However, subsequent FOMC communications--including the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, speeches by various FOMC members, and the minutes from the March meeting--were generally seen as emphasizing the Committee's concern about upside risks to inflation."
"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had been picking up in recent months, although the data were not uniformly positive."
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continued to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"Reduced M2 growth in April reflected, in part, slower-than-average buildups of deposits associated with final tax payments by individuals."
"The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to Â¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
"Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to using the Federal Reserve's full range of tools in order to support the U. S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
"Participants also discussed risks that could lead to a flatter trajectory for the federal funds rate in the medium term, including a failure of actual or expected inflation to move up to the Committee's 2 percent objective."
Economic growth was expected to moderate later this year.
"Over the past year, the Federal Reserve's response to the financial turbulence had encompassed substantial monetary policy easing, the provision of large volumes of liquidity through standard and extraordinary means, and facilitating the resolution of troubled, systemically important financial institutions."
"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged, while wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000."
"Even so, average monthly growth in payrolls from January through May was in line with last year's pace."
"Housing prices had tended to edge higher across the nation, though there were signs that the price appreciation had eased in some parts of the country, notably on the West Coast."
The virus and the measures taken to protect public health had induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
"Once the ongoing inventory correction was completed, however, it was not clear to what extent final demand in key sectors of the economy, notably business capital investment, would provide support for further economic growth."
"On the other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more pronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"Several participants noted that a late departure could result in the stance of monetary policy becoming excessively accommodative, leading to undesirably high inflation."
"Concurrently, though, state and local governments facing large shortfalls in revenues in a sluggish economy were holding down the overall growth in their expenditures."
"6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained below core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined."
This approach was viewed as consistent with the Committee's plans to rely on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as the primary indicator of the stance of monetary policy.
"First, while the overall outlook remained favorable, there had been signs of deceleration in economic activity in recent quarters, particularly in business fixed investment and manufacturing."
"In light of stable inflation expectations and incoming data indicating low rates of inflation, policymakers continued to anticipate that both overall and core inflation would remain subdued through 2012."
"Equity prices were also supported by a broad increase in investors' willingness to take riskier positions, in part likely reflecting an easing of concerns about EMEs early in the period."
"Averaging through its recent fluctuations, inflation appeared to be running near the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; with longer-term inflation expectations stable, members anticipated that inflation over the medium run would be at or below that rate."
"In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected."
The foreign trade sector of the economy was projected to provide less of a safety valve for the accommodation of domestic demand going forward.
The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in July at 4.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in November, and job gains were strong, on average, over recent months."
"Overall, most participants viewed the recent softer inflation data as primarily reflecting transitory factors, but a few expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's objective may have slowed."
"Regarding the federal budget, a recent narrowing of the deficit was noted, but the improvement appeared to be attributable to cyclical factors and to increases in the level of tax collections that were not likely to be repeated."
"They thought that progress could be very slow, particularly in light of the likelihood that tighter resource utilization may impart only modest upward pressure on prices."
"Short-term euro interest rates moved lower as euro-area institutions drew a substantial amount of three-year funds from the ECB, and dollar funding costs for European banks also appeared to decline."
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"Continued progress in lifting various constraints on economic growth, including the unwinding of excessive or misdirected capital expenditures undertaken in earlier years and the steps taken to address corporate governance and credit problems were also working to strengthen the expansion."
"The strength in demand might itself be, at least in part, the result of the ongoing acceleration of productivity, with the latter feeding back on demand through higher equity prices and profitable investment opportunities."
"Among emerging market economies, real GDP in Brazil was flat in the third quarter, while exports from China slowed in recent months, although Chinese domestic demand appeared to remain strong."
"Inventory investment was projected to resume contributing to GDP growth over the second half of this year, after the sharp swing toward inventory runoffs in the second quarter."
"However, the members agreed that the marked degree of uncertainty in the outlook for productivity as well as velocity argued against any increases in the ranges at this point."
"In addition, the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratios were at or near post-recession lows."
"In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that data over the intermeeting period, including measures of inflation expectations, suggested that underlying inflation was not in the process of moving higher."
"Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on net over July and August, and this index rose at a significantly slower pace over the twelve months ended in August than over the preceding twelve months."
"Participants discussed the implications of a fall in longer-run r* for monetary policy, including the possibility that policy interest rates might be closer to the effective lower bound more frequently and for a long period, or that monetary policy was ill equipped to address structural factors such as the decline in productivity growth."
"U. S. equity prices rose, longer-term Treasury yields increased slightly, and the dollar depreciated."
"Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue outpacing the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to occur in the context of moderating economic growth."
"Over the twelve months ending in January, the increase in core consumer prices was around 1 percent--about Â¾ percentage point below the increase over the preceding twelve months."
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up gradually over the next year and a half from the very sluggish pace of the second quarter."
"A few participants, observing that low interest rates had increased the demand for riskier financial products, pointed to the possibility that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk-taking."
"Total private housing starts and building permits declined in August to levels somewhat below their averages in earlier months of the year, but data on overall home sales and builder ratings of new home sales continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant."
Real GDP growth in the major foreign industrial countries remained weak in the first quarter as external demand sagged amid heightened geopolitical uncertainties.
"In addition, solid economic expansion abroad was expected to boost the growth of U. S. exports for some period ahead."
"Committee members generally saw the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with a gradual strengthening of economic growth beginning next year, although they recognized that recent financial developments had boosted the downside risks to the economic outlook."
"Over the same 12-month period, consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slowly than overall prices; core PCE inflation--which excludes food and energy prices--was also around 1-1/2 percent."
"Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk for some time."
"The unemployment rate, however, remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
"The full effect of previous increases in interest rates on activity and prices probably had not yet been felt, and a pause was viewed as appropriate to limit the risks of tightening too much."
Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected.
"The members continued to report a high level of housing demand in numerous parts of the country, with housing construction described as a notably robust sector in many regional economies."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"The U. S. international trade deficit diminished in February to its lowest level since November 1999, as imports fell and exports rose a bit."
Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated somewhat after picking up earlier in the year; the moderation evidently reflected some slowing in the growth of business and household borrowing as well as paydowns of federal debt made possible by robust tax revenues.
"Regarding the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted that the risk assessment conditioned on ""appropriate policy"" no longer seemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee's economic and policy outlook."
"Other commodity prices were moderating, and nominal wages appeared to be rising only slowly."
"In general, loan demand remained weak."
"With regard to the federal sector, spending related to last yearâs hurricanes appeared likely to abate, and federal expenditures overall would probably be providing less impetus to aggregate demand going forward."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that their assessments of the medium-term prospects for economic growth and inflation were little changed from the previous meeting."
"Consistent with that view, several participants commented that alternative measures of inflation that removed the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction were running around 2 percent."
Participants viewed the recent data on housing starts and permits as well as the higher levels of sales and prices as indicative of continued recovery in the housing sector.
"In this regard, recent statistical and anecdotal information indicated that home sales were holding up well across the country, although higher-priced homes appeared to be selling relatively slowly in some areas."
"As at the June meeting, all participants expressed concern about continued elevated readings on core inflation and inflation risks going forward."
Poor liquidity in the market for Treasury inflation-protected securities continued to make these readings difficult to interpret.
"The recent increase in consumer spending appeared to be supported importantly by pent-up demands and possibly by other temporary factors, such as unusually large income tax refunds."
"Among the major currencies, the dollar rose against the euro and the pound sterling despite a tightening of European monetary policy in response to the implications for future inflation of indications of a strong pickup in economic activity."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in July after widening in June.
"The restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall."
"After decelerating in the preceding two months, indexes of U. S. consumer prices declined in June, reflecting a substantial drop in consumer energy prices."
"Emerging market mutual funds experienced sharp outflows in recent weeks, while EME stock prices declined and EME credit spreads widened on net."
Business spending on equipment and structures was expected to grow less rapidly in light of the projected moderate growth of sales and profits and the lower rate of utilization of production capacity now prevailing.
"Thus, the staff continued to project that core inflation would slow somewhat from its current pace over the next two years."
"Over the intermeeting period, global investors focused on changes in U. S. equity prices and interest rates, ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, and uncertainty regarding budget negotiations between the Italian government and the European Union."
"The foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depreciated immediately following the FOMC's November announcement of further asset purchases, subsequently appreciated amid intensifying concerns about stresses in the euro area and some apparent reassessment by investors of the monetary policy outlook in the United States."
"By contrast, M3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in September and October than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its large time deposit and other managed liability components to meet business demand for bank loans."
"Oil prices were anticipated to decline somewhat with the repair of hurricane-related damage to oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to some slowing in inflation."
"In preparation for a semi-annual report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth in nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 2001."
"Although house-price appreciation appeared to have slowed further since the end of the third quarter, robust gains in equity prices likely resulted in a small rise in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income last quarter."
"However, a number saw the potential effects on real economic activity as limited or only transitory, particularly in the current environment of balance sheet deleveraging, credit constraints, and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook."
Recent data indicated low and stable rates of core consumer inflation and apparently well-anchored inflation expectations.
"In that regard, consumer spending was seen as likely to provide some continuing, though moderate, impetus to the growth of the economy."
"Moreover, while energy prices had risen further in the intermeeting period, energy prices could well level out in coming quarters."
"Exports were unlikely to continue growing at the robust rate reported for the third quarter, but participants anticipated that the combination of the weaker dollar and still-strong, though perhaps less-rapid, growth abroad would mean continued firm growth in U. S. exports."
"Measures of firms' hiring plans improved, the rate of job openings increased slightly, and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little."
"On balance, broad equity price indexes were roughly unchanged, Treasury yields declined and the yield curve flattened, corporate and municipal bond spreads narrowed, and the dollar weakened somewhat."
"This development and the related erosion of the economic outlook and reduction in inflationary pressures led many central banks to reduce their policy rates, including in the internationally coordinated action announced on October 8."
"In the weeks following the July FOMC meeting, U. S. yields declined sharply and risk asset prices fell amid a spate of largely negative news about risks to the global economic outlook."
"Moreover, growth in Europe and Asia apparently remained solid, boosting U. S. exports."
"Against this backdrop, the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time so that the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities."
Economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but seemed likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.
"In both advanced and emerging market economies, declining prices for energy and other commodities contributed to decreases in 12-month measures of inflation since late last year."
Solid growth in wages and salaries and an increase in tax refunds generated a large increase in real disposable personal income in the first quarter.
"Core PCE prices, which exclude food and energy prices, increased 1-1/4 percent over the same period, with the increase damped in part by declines in the prices of non-energy imports."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Meanwhile, the staff forecast for inflation was marked up."
"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services was about unchanged in July from its June level, but both exports and imports dropped sharply as weakness in worldwide economic activity continued to affect the nation's foreign trade."
"In addition, large increases in health insurance costs were continuing to add to overall employment costs."
"Moreover, following the rapid and aggressive policy actions already taken, a more cautious policy move at this point would in his view appropriately limit the risks of producing an overly accommodative policy stance and rising inflation over time."
"Over 2007 as a whole, the deterioration in labor demand was most pronounced in the construction and financial activities industries, which had been hardest hit by the difficulties in the housing and mortgage markets."
Mr. Kocherlakota strongly endorsed the sixth paragraph of the statement because providing information about the Committee's intentions for the federal funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels should help stimulate economic activity by reducing uncertainty.
"In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to slow toward, but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth."
"Measures of labor compensation rose at moderate rates, outpacing the rise in consumer prices over the past year."
"Nearly all members judged that it was appropriate to reiterate the expectation that economic conditions--including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period, but one member believed that communicating such an expectation would create conditions that could lead to financial imbalances."
"Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, conversely, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated."
"A few pointed out that with inflation likely to remain low for some time and to rise only gradually, maintaining an accommodative stance of policy could extend the strengthening of the labor market."
"The personal saving rate was still relatively high, and household wealth had been boosted by ongoing gains in housing and equity prices."
"However, available data suggested that economic activity outside the United States appeared to be decelerating somewhat."
Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a strong pace in the first half of the year.
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent."
"In many Districts, business contacts experienced rising costs of nonlabor inputs, particularly trucking, rail, and shipping rates and prices of steel, aluminum, lumber, and petroleum-based commodities."
Many participants thought it important to explore means for better communicating policymakers' thinking about future monetary policy and its relationship to evolving economic conditions.
"Specifically, members agreed to indicate the Committee's anticipation that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"The steep run-up in housing prices, recent increases in equity prices, and anticipated gains in payrolls were viewed as likely to boost the growth of consumption spending next year to a pace somewhat above that recorded this year."
"While rising energy prices posed an upside risk to the inflation forecast, they also posed a downside risk to economic growth."
"Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180, 000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year."
"However, other participants pointed to the subdued pace of gains in labor costs as a factor damping inflation, and reports from contacts suggested that upward pressure on wages remained limited."
"If labor markets remained under pressure, nominal compensation costs were likely to pick up at some point as one-time savings in worker benefit costs ran out and as workers became less willing to trade off lower wages for increased security; such a development would foster increases in labor costs that ultimately would feed through to higher prices."
"The ratio of household wealth to disposable income appeared to have moved down again in the first quarter, damped by the appreciable net decline in broad equity prices over that period and by further reductions in house prices."
"Given the apparent resilience of the U. S. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had previously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline forecast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, the projection for near-term growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was little changed from the one prepared for the previous meeting."
"Monetary policy had been eased substantially over the past year, and, with the real federal funds rate at an unusually low level, policy seemed well positioned to support an economic recovery as the forces restraining demand abated."
"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
Private nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply in April after a small drop in March.
"Many participants pointed to substantial slack in resource utilization, along with well-anchored inflation expectations, as likely to contribute to subdued inflation for some time."
"Consequently, members expected that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term, and labor market conditions would remain strong."
"Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
"According to another view, recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad-based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer-term financial conditions, importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate, and, therefore, the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services."
"The nominal U. S. international trade deficit widened in February as imports rose briskly, outpacing the increase in exports."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey declined slightly, on balance, in May and early June, while longer-term inflation expectations from the survey were little changed."
"In the secondary market for leveraged loans, the average bid price moved up further over the intermeeting period."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
"The rate of job openings edged up in recent months, the share of small businesses reporting that they had hard-to-fill positions increased, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance trended down, on net, over the intermeeting period, although the rate of gross private-sector hiring was still somewhat low."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
"On balance, prices of global risky assets increased notably, implied volatility dropped sharply, and the dollar depreciated against most currencies."
"Moreover, inflationary pressures in a number of overseas economies appeared to have increased of late, perhaps partly in response to heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries, and this development had the potential to add to the prices of U. S. imports."
"Altogether, net exports made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter."
Historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing.
"But with households remaining confident about the future and equity prices having rebounded from their post-attack declines, sustained growth in household expenditures was seen as a likely prospect."
"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
"Nonetheless, there were some risks of rising inflation."
"Based on the available data, PCE price inflation over the 12 months ending in August was estimated to be about 1-1/2 percent, remaining below the Committee's longer-run objective."
"With regard to the possibility that more robust productivity increases would be holding down production costs, it was noted that a surge in economic activity, such as had occurred in late 1996 and early 1997, tended to be accompanied by above-trend gains in productivity."
"Several expressed concern that the persistence of quite rapid monetary growth this year was symptomatic of a monetary policy that was not positioned to restrain ebullient domestic demand sufficiently, even if short-term real interest rates were quite high."
"Nonetheless, the members decided to implement the previously stated policy of releasing, on an infrequent basis, an announcement immediately after certain FOMC meetings when the stance of monetary policy remained unchanged."
"Over the intermeeting period, the expected path of monetary policy over the next year as measured by money market futures rates moved up significantly on net, apparently because economic data releases and announcements by large financial firms imparted greater confidence among investors about the prospects for the economy's performance in coming quarters."
Some participants raised the concern that tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an increase in the ability of firms to pass through increases in tariffs or in other input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation.
" their discussions related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
"The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
"In the view of these members, a limited policy move at this time would appropriately supplement the small firming action taken at midyear and at least for now would position monetary policy where it needed to be to foster continued subdued inflation and good economic performance."
Lower mortgage rates and house prices contributed to an increase in housing affordability.
"Indeed, the weaker dollar, higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had not had a large effect on retail prices in the past."
They judged that the Committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support further strengthening of the labor market and allow participants to assess whether incoming information on inflation showed that it was solidly on a track toward the Committee's objective.
"Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members but one judged that continued provision of monetary accommodation was warranted in order to support further progress toward the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
"Manufacturing output decreased, partly reflecting the effects on export demand of earlier appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"Indicators of home prices remained weak, reflecting a large inventory of unsold properties and modest demand for homes."
"Household spending had continued to advance and the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement, but growth in the business sector had slowed."
"Notwithstanding recent benign readings on inflation, the forecast for core PCE inflation was raised somewhat, owing in part to the recent further rise in energy prices and, in light of the revisions to historical data, a higher assumed trajectory for the nonmarket component of core PCE prices."
This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
Output growth in the advanced foreign economies picked up in the third quarter.
"Labor market conditions improved some in recent months, but the unemployment rate remained elevated despite a noticeable drop in November."
"Conversely, in such circumstances, an increase in inflation expectations lowers short-term real interest rates, stimulating the economy."
"Further downward pressure on interest rates was exerted by the market's response to the release of the minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference to Committee members' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening was not necessary at that time."
"A leveling trend in stock market prices, should one materialize, likely would have a significant restraining effect on consumer confidence and the growth of spending over time."
"The extraordinary expansion in business fixed investment in recent years, fueled to a major extent by purchases of new equipment, was also expected to moderate over time as a result of the large buildup and reduced utilization of capacity and the forecasted slower growth in final sales."
"One participant noted that core inflation had been held down in recent quarters by unusually slow increases in the price index for shelter, and that the recent behavior of core inflation might be a misleading signal of the underlying inflation trend."
"Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectationsâincluding those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Survey of Consumer Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participantsâwere little changed, on balance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in early December to the bottom of its recent range after ticking up in November."
Retail gasoline prices moved up sharply following the landfall of Hurricane Harvey and appeared likely to put temporary upward pressure on the 12-month change in total PCE prices.
The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the Committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.
Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.
"Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
"Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor vehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer months."
"Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the economic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term."
"The Committee again stated that it currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
"In their discussion of key sectors of the economy, policymakers noted that business investment had been expanding robustly and was likely to continue to be buoyed by the strength of productivity and profits."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace."
"Against this backdrop, robust growth in business spending was seen as likely, even as household spending growth moderated somewhat."
"Regarding global imbalances and the current account deficit in the United States, a number of participants expressed doubts that such imbalances would be reduced in the near-term."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"Currency declined somewhat in November as foreign demand for U. S. banknotes appeared to ebb, consistent with the continued stabilization in most global financial markets."
"It was noted that such an acceleration would likely be accompanied by significantly more rapid growth in bank lending and in the monetary aggregates, suggesting that such indicators might prove to be useful sources of information."
"The Committee stated that, over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help promote moderate economic growth."
"Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending."
"With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis."
"Nonetheless, participants noted that inventories remained elevated and needed to be worked down before growth in this sector resumed."
"In addition, improving economic conditions abroad, among other factors, had induced a firming in oil and other commodity prices, and had supported the foreign exchange value of other currencies relative to the dollar."
Measures of underlying consumer price inflation remained low.
"The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices, the remaining effects of prior monetary restraint, and the continuation of somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
"Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint had diminished."
A few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years.
"However, it was noted that the prevailing level of inflation was uncomfortably high, and resource utilization was elevated."
"Economic activity in Japan appeared to have decelerated somewhat from its first-half pace but continued to expand, and inflation measured on a 12-month basis turned positive in the middle of this year."
"Some other participants, however, were more worried about upside risks to inflation arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further."
"Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in May, although the rise was associated with a surge in government hiring of census workers that more than offset a considerable contraction in private payrolls."
Survey measures of short- and long-term inflation expectations were essentially unchanged.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Consumer spending, business investment, and residential homebuilding, though remaining robust, apparently also were decelerating somewhat after very strong gains in the first quarter; and the erosion in net exports continued to damp demand for domestically produced goods."
"Equity prices of most large domestic financial institutions outperformed the broader market, on net, over the intermeeting period."
"The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was revised up, primarily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates, a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices, and somewhat less appreciation of the broad real dollar."
"Measures of expected longer-run inflation from a number of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
Reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Nonetheless, as they had at previous meetings, members expressed particular concern about the outlook for prices in the absence of appreciable slowing in the growth of aggregate demand, which appeared to be adding to pressures on labor resources."
"While longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation declined substantially in recent months, survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"Employment growth in earlier months had been solid, and more-recent improvements included the further decline in the unemployment rate in March and the gradual progress being made in some other labor market indicators."
"In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1."
"The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress, particularly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized."
"Concerning the outlook for inflation, members noted that despite the long duration of very tight labor markets across the nation, labor compensation had increased at a slightly lower rate this year while consumer price inflation had remained moderate, albeit above year-earlier levels owing to a sharp rise in energy prices."
"The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity had continued to decline into the fourth quarter, although some very recent data suggested that the rate of decline might be moderating."
"In addition, reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U. S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products."
"With regard to recent financial developments, it was noted that regulatory changes and impending MMF reforms likely had led to an increase in certain short-term interest rates, but these developments were expected to have only a small effect on the borrowing costs of nonfinancial corporations and little adverse influence on overall financial market conditions."
"Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth."
Growth in employment slowed in June and July after displaying significant improvement in preceding months.
A number of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances.
"U. S. economic data, particularly the June employment report, also contributed to the rise in yields over the period."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
"But a few participants noted that the risk remained that inflationary pressures could rise as the expansion continued, especially if monetary policy remained highly accommodative for too long."
"The risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and inflation were seen as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
Broad U. S. equity price indexes were highly correlated with foreign equity indexes over the intermeeting period and posted net declines.
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had strengthened and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate rate."
"Syndicated leveraged loans were issued at a record pace in the first quarter, supported by strong demand for this type of asset, particularly from nonbank institutions."
The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
"A couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in light of the strength of the economy in the second half of 2013."
Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity.
"Beyond 2018, the inflation forecast was unchanged from the previous projection."
The unemployment rate edged up to 4.
"Some members indicated that in light of continued robust economic growth, tight labor markets, and improving financial conditions they had a preference for awaiting further developments that might provide a stronger basis for an easing action."
"A couple of participants favored a cut in the target range at this meeting, judging that a prolonged period with inflation running below 2 percent warranted a more accommodative policy response to firmly center inflation and inflation expectations around the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
"As a result, the staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little on balance."
"Accordingly, all but one member judged that maintaining the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
"Some participants indicated that prospects for economic activity in many foreign economies appeared to be subdued, that global inflation and interest rates remained very low by historical standards, and that recurring bouts of global financial market instability remained a risk."
The rise in yields was also supported by the release of some stronger-than-expected inflation data in the euro area and by European Central Bank communications that volatility in yields was to be expected.
"Several participants noted that some of the softness in the market-based measures likely reflected changes in risk and liquidity premiums, and that some of the survey-based measures appeared to be excessively sensitive to movements in gasoline prices."
Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U. S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.
"Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
"AlÂ­though total PCE price inflation was forecast to be about the same in 2017 as it was last year, core PCE price inflation was anticipated to be a little lower than in 2016, and consumer food and energy price inflation was expected to be a little higher."
"The staff reviewed the changes that had been made since the onset of the crisis to the terms of the primary credit program, including loan maturities and interest rates."
"With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members decided to note the further improvement in economic activity and in labor markets."
A couple of participants pointed out that the recent decline in equity prices could be viewed as bringing equity valuations more in line with historical norms.
"In addition, subpar economic activity abroad was a negative factor for export growth."
The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.
They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced.
"The members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early February."
"In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia."
"As a result, they agreed that the statement accompanying the announcement of their decision should continue to indicate that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation."
"Moreover, the unusually large fraction of those individuals with jobs who were working part time for economic reasons, as well as the uncommonly low level of the average workweek, pointed to only a gradual decline in unemployment as the economic recovery proceeded."
"Real GDP was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy."
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near term.
"Regarding the outlook for inflation, the most recent data were seen as consistent with an assessment that a portion of the higher rates of price increases recorded earlier in the year had reflected transitory factors."
Dealers also noted that demand for funding all types of securities decreased over the same reference period.
Some members noted that at the May meeting they had contemplated the need for an easing action at this meeting unless compelling evidence developed in the interim that the hoped-for acceleration in economic activity was clearly under way.
"The abatement of war-related risks was reflected in sizable declines in forward-looking measures of uncertainty in short- and long-term interest rates, exchange rates, and oil and equity prices."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace."
"In contrast, prices of nonfood, non-energy goods were apparently boosted by upward pressure from earlier increases in commodity and import prices, and motor vehicle prices rose further, reflecting the extremely low levels of vehicle inventories."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were turbulent over the first month and a half of the year, apparently reflecting investors' concerns about global growth prospects and associated risks to the U. S. outlook."
3 Each participant's projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy.
"In the fourth quarter, the rise in consumer prices excluding food and energy slowed."
"With neutral interest rates potentially remaining quite low, policymakers also observed that, in order to promote the Federal Reserve's policy objectives, the framework should have the capacity to supplement conventional policy accommodation with other measures when short-term nominal interest rates are near zero."
"While some participants had lowered their assessments of the prospects for global economic growth, several noted that the likelihood of further responses by policymakers abroad had increased."
"They generally concurred that data releases during the intermeeting period on components of private domestic demand had been disappointing, but most participants judged that the slowdown in growth of domestic spending would be temporary, citing possible measurement problems and other transitory factors."
The mild downturn in economic activity in the third quarter was seen as likely to deepen over the remainder of the year and to continue for a time next year.
"Ms. George judged that, with the labor market near full employment and inflation approaching the Committee's 2 percent objective, another step in the gradual adjustment of monetary policy was appropriate."
"This performance reflected favorable underlying fundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained earnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions in the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and loan markets."
"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2."
"Many participants noted some risk of a protracted period of excessively low inflation, especially if inflation expectations were to move down in response to lower actual inflation and increasing economic slack, and a few even saw some risk of deflation."
Nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in July even though manufacturing payrolls plunged in association with the General Motors strike; job growth remained strong in most non-manufacturing sectors.
"After being roughly flat over most of the intermeeting period, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose moderately toward the end of the period but remained at a level consistent with further moderate job gains in the coming months."
"At the same time, the unemployment rate edged down from 4."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in August.
"Inflation had declined from its rate earlier in the year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and inflation expectations had been stable."
Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal.
"Nonetheless, the members continued to anticipate a strengthening as the year progressed and during 2002, fostered to a large extent by the lagged effects on spending of the substantial easing in monetary policy since early this year, the stimulus from recently enacted tax cuts, and the positive effects on household and business purchasing power of some recent reductions in energy prices."
"With their views of the outlook for the economy little changed, participants generally continued to judge that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"The sharp drops and unusual volatility in the prices of many financial assets since the beginning of the fourth quarter were likely to cause more losses for financial institutions, and a number of participants noted that loan delinquencies were increasing significantly in the consumer sector, adding to pressures on banks' balance sheets and reinforcing banks' cautious lending stance."
"Subsequently, higher-than-expected inflation data, remarks by the Chairman that were viewed as pointing to future rate increases, and the depreciation of the dollar all led market participants to price in a somewhat steeper path for future policy."
"Although employment continued to contract in August, the pace of job losses slowed noticeably from that of earlier in the year."
"More fundamentally, persistent tightness in labor markets risked a continuing uptrend in labor compensation increases that, at some point, could not be fully offset by productivity gains."
"The members were uncertain as to the degree and timing of the strengthening in final demand, and although a relatively prompt and strong rebound could not be ruled out, many saw a variety of factors that pointed to the possibility that the upturn could be weaker or more delayed than the central tendencies of their expectations."
Price inflation was still low.
"In contrast, the rise in economic activity in the euro area was subdued, as favorable readings for the manufacturing sector were counterbalanced by weakness in domestic demand."
"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in October, primarily because of a surge in merchandise imports."
These obligations include seeking to direct the member's economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
"One key consideration discussed by policymakers was the appropriate amount of flexibility that an implementation framework might have--for example, the extent to which a framework could readily enable interest rate control under a wide range of economic and financial circumstances."
"With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year."
Meeting participants saw both upside and downside risks to their outlook for expansion around the rate of growth of the economy's potential.
All members agreed that the Committee would continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and would employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
"Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the November- December period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in 1994."
"Even though the unemployment rate was projected to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing slack in resource utilization."
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
The staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in financial interconnectedness.
"In considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates--including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility--without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves."
"Members also agreed to continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal, with one member viewing further progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective as necessary before taking another step to remove policy accommodation."
"Resumption in economic activity, as well as payments to households under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, had supported household income and consumer expenditures."
"The dollar depreciated over much of the intermeeting period, but then reversed course following the release of better-than-expected U. S. data on employment and retail sales for November."
"Moreover, the tightening that had occurred in financial conditions through the spring and the rise in energy prices since the fall of 1998 had not yet exerted their full effects on aggregate demand, and members expected these effects to contribute to a more sustainable rate of growth in aggregate spending."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low, while survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"However, one participant noted that some homebuilders were reporting that land prices were edging up and that financing was available from nontraditional sources, suggesting that conditions in the housing market could be improving."
"As anticipated, growth in consumer spending seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter, and participants continued to expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
"In addition, M3's expansion probably had been held down by a sharp slowing in the growth of bank credit in July."
"Participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation, and inflation for items other than food and energy, had come in lower than expected."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"Concerns about one of Portugal's largest banks and about litigation risks facing European banks weighed on European financial markets, prompting yield spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area to widen and equity price indexes for European banks to decline."
Several commented that the stronger labor market still appeared to be exerting little upward pressure on wage or price inflation.
"Although upward pressures on energy prices continued to boost overall consumer prices in April and May, price increases for nonfood, non-energy items remained small."
"Regarding the labor market, many participants commented that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed."
"With regard to any role for monetary policy in responding to possible imbalances in housing or bond markets, meeting participants stressed the importance of the pursuit of their core objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1/4 to 1/2 percent at this meeting."
"Headline inflation continued to rise in emerging Asia, driven by energy and food prices."
"It was noted that the expected path of the federal funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial increase, was most important in influencing financial conditions and thus in affecting the outlook for the economy and inflation."
Several noted that a return to growth in real wages in line with productivity growth would provide welcome support for household spending.
"Inflation had continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"Market participants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating that economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than had been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while broad indexes of equity prices moved lower."
This accommodative stance of monetary policy was expected to support further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
"Some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
They referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for wages and prices in the year ahead.
"The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
The three-year-ahead measure of inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations decreased from 3.
"Most projected that the economy would begin to recover slowly in the second half of 2009, aided by substantial monetary policy easing and by anticipated fiscal stimulus."
Meeting participants observed that financial strains continued to exert a powerful drag on economic activity and that the adverse feedback loop between financial conditions and economic performance had intensified.
The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic growth had moderated somewhat."
"Unemployment continued around the low levels seen since last fall, and many business contacts reported difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified workers, especially for certain types of professional and skilled positions."
"More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
They recognized that there were at present few statistical indications that the economy was on a significantly slower growth track.
"With productivity also continuing to accelerate, unit labor costs had changed little and measures of core price inflation had increased only mildly."
A few participants raised the concern that a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting could encourage excessive risk-taking and exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector.
The staff anticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity.
"The experience of recent years amply demonstrated, however, that the extent to which prospective growth in demand might exceed further expansion in the economy's potential and the implications for inflation were subject to a wide range of uncertainty as to both degree and timing."
"Recent data suggested that, thus far, indirect effects of elevated energy prices on core inflation had been muted."
"Lower oil prices, weaker-than-expected economic data, and uncertainty over U. S. trade policy likely contributed to the weakness in the Canadian dollar."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Very high long-duration unemployment might indicate a mismatch between unemployed workers' skills and employers' needs, suggesting that a substantial part of the increase in unemployment since the beginning of the recession reflected factors other than a shortfall in aggregate demand."
"Rising demand, elevated underlying productivity growth, and accommodative financial conditions should keep business spending on a strong uptrend."
Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations showed no signs of moving lower despite the considerable margin of labor- and product-market slack present in the economy.
Headline equity indexes abroad and foreign benchmark sovereign yields declined over the intermeeting period in apparent response to signs of a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity and reduced demand for risky assets.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants noted that their assessments of the medium-term prospects for economic growth and inflation had not changed materially from the previous meeting."
"Yields on Treasury coupon securities declined slightly over the intermeeting period, risk spreads on corporate debt securities changed little, and major indexes of equity prices edged lower on balance."
"A few members noted that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity, could be viewed as non-threatening."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong pace, on average, in July and August."
Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.
"With regard to trade policies, a number of participants viewed the range of possible outcomes for economic activity and inflation to be particularly wide, depending on what actions were taken by the United States and how U."
Mr. Hoenig noted that the economic recovery was shifting from transitory to more sustainable sources of growth and was picking up momentum.
"With the economy facing continuing headwinds, members generally expected a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with gradual further declines in the unemployment rate."
"Subsequent Federal Reserve communications, which emphasized that decisions about the two policy tools were distinct and underscored that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable period after purchases are completed, were seen as having helped clarify the Committee's policy strategy."
Most participants anticipated that a flattening of oil and other commodity prices and easing pressures on resources would contribute to some moderation in inflation pressures.
"Many participants judged that the recent significant decline in energy prices would provide a boost to consumer spending over the near term, with several of them noting that the drop in gasoline prices would benefit lower-income households in particular."
"In the labor market, layoffs subsided noticeably in the final months of last year, but the unemployment rate remained elevated and hiring stayed weak."
"Currency advanced significantly, supported by robust foreign demand for U. S. bank notes."
Some expressed concern that the increases in mortgage rates seen over the intermeeting period had the potential to further depress the demand for housing and thus impede an economic recovery.
"Economic growth in the foreign industrial countries slowed moderately in the third quarter, and the available information suggested a further reduction in the fourth quarter."
"The latest readings on consumer sentiment had been positive, perhaps reflecting the recent declines in oil prices."
"Many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their Districts, evidenced by low unemployment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open positions or retaining workers, or some signs of upward pressure on wages."
The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.
"The further large increase in energy prices also prompted an upward revision of the forecast of headline PCE inflation in the second half of 2008, and headline inflation was expected to exceed core inflation by a considerable margin this year."
Indications that rapid growth in structural productivity would persist and widespread reports that strong competitive pressures in most markets continued to inhibit business efforts to increase prices in the face of rising costs also were favorable factors in the outlook.
"Although the economic outlook had improved further in recent weeks and the risks to the forecast had become more balanced, the level of economic activity was likely to be quite weak and resource utilization low."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given real GDP growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment in this projection."
"The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
Household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.
"Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy."
Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed.
"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
"While job losses had moderated, hiring had yet to strengthen, holding down net increases in employment."
"However, median expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years were only a little above the average range reported in recent years."
"Participants were most concerned about the marginal cost of additional asset purchases arising from risks to financial stability, pointing out that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could provide an incentive for excessive risk-taking in the financial sector."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Following an unsustainably high rate of expansion in the second quarter, growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the emerging market economies appeared to have slowed markedly, notwithstanding an apparent acceleration in economic activity in China."
"Reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth, the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys."
"Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions."
"Equity price indexes and corporate bond spreads were little changed, on net, and, in aggregate, corporations continued to tap credit markets at a solid pace."
Spreads on Greek government debt relative to German bunds widened appreciably before falling back as press reports indicated that euro-area countries were discussing a possible aid package for Greece and the Greek government announced further deficit reduction measures.
The unemployment rate jumped 0.
"The ratio of household wealth to income had dropped sharply in the first quarter, reflecting substantial net declines in broad equity prices and further depreciation of house prices."
"Concurrently, however, many firms were able to maintain or even to increase their profit margins through a variety of cost-cutting and productivity-enhancing measures."
"In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other resources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level, and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction over the year ahead."
The relatively low level of inflation and well-contained inflationary expectations allowed the Committee flexibility to focus on countering the downside risks to the economy without incurring a significant threat of fostering expectations of higher inflation.
"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"The turnaround in the economy and the gradual strengthening of the recovery would also be fostered by the completion of downward adjustments to inventories, a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investments, and the added purchasing power arising from the recent declines in oil prices."
"In light of subdued inflation over recent years, a few participants observed that adjustments in the stance of policy should take account of the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations have drifted a bit below levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
"It was noted that this difficulty could be a factor restraining the demand for housing, particularly among younger households who have high levels of student loan debt or weak job prospects."
"Second, the staff lowered slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad.
"Much of the increase reflected rising prices of goods held, and real inventory accumulation was subdued."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"Indeed, with the notable exception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation as measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease marginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years."
"They generally judged that risks to the growth outlook, including strains in global financial markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks."
"As a result, the forecast for consumer price inflation over the medium run was little changed relative to that prepared for the January meeting."
"However, if longer-term interest rates moved substantively lower than assumed in the baseline, some modest reinvestments in MBS could occur for a few months next year concurrent with the pickup in seasonal turnover."
"Participants observed that a key source of downward pressure on Treasury rates arose from flight-to-safety flows, driven by downside risks to global growth, escalating trade tensions, and disappointing global data."
"The increase in the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate at the June meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates, and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the new target range over the intermeeting period except on quarter-end."
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes moved higher, while stock prices for large domestic banking organizations moved lower on net."
"Committee Policy Action In the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, most members agreed that the economic outlook had deteriorated by enough to warrant a Committee response at this meeting."
"Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices."
"As a result, the staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down slightly."
The damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan appeared to be sharply curtailing Japanese economic activity and posed concerns about disruptions to supply chains and production in other economies.
"So far, aggregate measures of labor compensation were showing only moderate increases, but looking ahead, the possibility that labor costs might rise more rapidly as a result of the tightness in labor market was seen as an upside risk to inflation."
"Those developments included a recent uptick in core measures of consumer prices, a drop in the dollar on foreign exchange markets, and still elevated energy prices--all against the backdrop of longer-term inflation expectations that were firmly anchored."
"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first few months of 2018, on balance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending."
"Several participants indicated that signs of improvements in labor compensation would be an important signal, while a few others deemphasized the value of labor compensation data for judging incipient inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empirical connection between wage and price inflation."
"More recent indicators for the EMEs, including purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), pointed to a rebound in economic activity in the fourth quarter."
"Staff Presentation on Policy Tools The staff gave a presentation on several tools that could be used, within the Committee's current policy framework, to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to support the economic recovery."
"Pending the completion of that study and the Committee's consideration of alternative asset allocations, the Manager suggested that the Desk could rely on temporary operations with relatively long maturities to meet the growth in underlying reserve needs that could not comfortably be met by further outright purchases of Treasury securities."
"Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflationary pressures."
"While wages appeared to be increasingly subject to upward pressure, productivity had picked up in recent quarters, and the persisting strength in profits suggested that unit labor costs were not accelerating noticeably."
"Inflation had been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities."
"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in October, and both exports and imports fell sharply from the previous month."
"However, some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened, and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation."
"Key factors that influence consumer spendingâincluding the low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low borrowing ratesâwere supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
Authorities in some emerging market economies also took measures to limit capital inflows and credit growth.
The near-term forecast for inflation was revised down slightly to reflect some recent softer-than-expected data.
"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"Some thought it would be helpful to clarify the reasoning underlying the language in the FOMC's postmeeting statement indicating that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"In Europe, economic growth rebounded in Germany but slowed somewhat in France and the United Kingdom."
"At the same time, it was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion."
"These participants continued to expect inflation to move back to the Committee's 2 percent target over the medium term as resource slack diminished in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations, although a few of them thought the return to 2 percent might be quite gradual."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
One participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth.
"Differences in construction, coverage, and other factors meant that none of the individual measures was clearly superior in assessing general inflation trends, and several members commented that all measures needed to be monitored."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"It also indicated that financial markets remained under considerable stress, and that the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member concluded that, although the U. S. economy had strengthened and labor underutilization had diminished, economic conditions did not warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
"The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the latter seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity against the backdrop of heightened anxiety and uncertainty about economic prospects and a sharp drop, at least initially, in stock prices after the equity markets reopened on September 17."
"Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability."
Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictive measures to contain it.
"Growth at this rate would represent a noticeable slowing from the pace that had prevailed in recent years, and its realization depended importantly on the damping effects on domestic demand of the less accommodative financial conditions that had developed in recent months--higher long-term interest rates and a flattening of equity prices."
But it also could be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic output; such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in productivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by stretching available labor further.
M2 growth slowed a little in November from October's elevated pace.
"The run-up in mortgage rates since the latter part of June was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months, but the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates."
"Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
Members judged that the effects of the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity in the near term and would pose risks to the economic outlook.
"In considering the statement to be released following this meeting, members concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices, the expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually."
"They generally endorsed holding press conferences after the four FOMC meetings each year for which participants provide numerical projections of several key economic variables, conditional on appropriate monetary policy."
The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1996.
Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services.
The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
"Inflation had declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting the declines in energy prices."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
"Contacts in the building sector suggested that construction firms were attempting to reduce their backlogs of unsold homes, both by cutting back sharply on new construction and by offering substantial price incentives."
"Equity prices rose, and corporate bond spreads narrowed notably."
"Indicators of layoffs remained elevated, although initial claims for unemployment insurance drifted down a little during October."
"Given the outlook for economic activity, rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected to change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly."
"The vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the Committee's press release to be made available shortly after the meeting: The risks to the Committee's outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future."
"In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"However, TIPS-based inflation compensation had declined, on balance, in recent quarters."
"The 12-month change in headline PCE prices increased further, to 1."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
Mr. Jordan dissented because growth rates of various measures of money and credit in the second half of 1997 and the first quarter of this year were not consistent in his view with continued progress in reducing inflation.
"Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico, China, and some other parts of emerging Asia."
"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection."
All but one member concluded that it would be appropriate to begin reinvesting principal received from agency debt and MBS held in the SOMA by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities in order to keep constant the face value of securities held in the SOMA and thus avoid the upward pressure on longer-term interest rates that might result if those holdings were allowed to decline.
"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, partly restrained by earlier declines in energy prices along with further decreases in non-energy import prices."
"At that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective."
"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
"These members expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise toward 2 percent gradually, and that policymakers would likely have ample time to respond if signs of rising inflationary pressures did begin to emerge."
"Currency continued its strong increase, apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for U. S. banknotes."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 24-25 meeting indicated that U. S. economic activity continued to expand moderately, while global growth appeared to be slowing."
"In the energy sector, these challenges included still-low oil demand, excess inventories, and low oil prices, while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities, pandemic-related disruptions in some food processing plants, and a significant decline in demand for ethanol."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
"Businesses added a bit to their inventory positions after an extended period of sizable declines, but final sales changed little: business capital spending weakened somewhat further while growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays slowed."
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through July and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.
"In the advanced foreign economies, economic indicators were downbeat in Japan but elsewhere pointed to some improvement from a weak fourth quarter; GDP growth rebounded in the euro area and also appeared to pick up in Canada and the United Kingdom."
"Real disposable personal income also grew slowly in the first quarter, restrained by rapidly rising prices for energy and food."
"Meanwhile, increases in consumer food prices slowed in recent months."
"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out."
"A number of participants noted that, given the recent large adverse shocks to output and inflation, their projections even late in the forecast period did not fully reveal their perceptions of longer-run sustainable rates of economic growth and unemployment or the measured rates of inflation that would be consistent with price stability."
"A few participants expressed concerns about the eventual economic impact of the change in financial conditions since the spring; in particular, increases in mortgage rates and home prices had reduced the affordability of housing, and the higher rates were at least partly responsible for some slowing in that sector."
"Industrial production fell sharply further in October, and the cuts continued to be spread widely across groups and industries, reflecting weak demand for business equipment, efforts by firms to pare inventories, and foreign competition."
"The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes moved down over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting policymakers' communications that reinforced market expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation."
"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"Over the next two and a half years, they continued to expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to levels close to their current assessments of its longer-run normal value."
The available data suggested that net exports would be a small drag on real GDP growth in the second quarter.
"Ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remained contained."
"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation."
"Although the November employment report was considerably better than anticipated, several participants observed that more than one good report would be needed to provide convincing evidence of recovery in the labor market."
Upward pressures on food and energy prices had led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months.
"The growth of imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting higher petroleum prices, and in non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods."
"The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment."
"Even so, they believed it was useful to discuss that possibility because of the implications for financial markets and institutions and for the conduct of monetary policy of reducing short-term interest rates to very low levels."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally noted that there had been little change in the economic outlook since the September meeting, and all members but one again judged that it would be appropriate for the Committee to await more evidence that progress toward its economic objectives would be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases."
A few participants noted differences in the behavior of measures of cyclical and acyclical components of inflation.
"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
Substantial resource slack was also likely to keep price inflation low in the future.
"Over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be relatively small, and slack in labor and product markets persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was projected to run somewhat below the FOMC's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent through 2016."
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally agreed that the economic expansion was progressing roughly as anticipated, with real economic activity expanding at a solid rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee's objective."
"However, the possibility that core inflation would not moderate as anticipated was still a significant concern."
Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of large U. S. banking organizations were again volatile over the period.
"Real residential investment appeared to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price appreciation."
"The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"Mr. McTeer dissented for essentially the same reasons he did at the June 30 meeting: low inflation and, except for energy, minimal inflation in the pipeline."
"Looking ahead, members, in part echoing the sentiment of contacts among retailers, anticipated renewed strength in consumer spending in the context of sizable further growth in employment and disposable incomes and a generally high level of consumer confidence."
"Further declines in oil prices, as evidenced by quotations in futures markets, would if realized have effects not only on so-called headline inflation but would help hold down core prices over time."
"A couple of other participants thought that overall consumer spending was likely still held back, at least in part, by ongoing concerns about future income and employment prospects."
Participants generally expected to see a resumption of monthly gains in payroll employment that would be sufficient to promote continued strengthening of the labor market.
"Despite these concerns, most major indexes of equity prices advanced further on balance."
"The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose, reportedly reflecting a growing perception that U. S. growth prospects were better than those in Europe and Japan."
"This forecast was predicated on a further anticipated waning of the restraint on spending growth from changes in fiscal policy, continued improvement in credit availability, increases in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in foreign economic growth."
Most major indexes of equity prices declined significantly over the intermeeting period.
"With increasing slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained, the members agreed that the balance of risks continued to be weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
"The Committee said that its action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity."
"One participant noted positive news about the fiscal position of the states; in some cases, revenues had risen sufficiently to enable increases in state government spending and employment."
The nominal U. S. international trade deficit widened in August and September.
"Most short-term interest rates have changed little on balance since the meeting on November 17, but longer- term rates have declined somewhat."
"It was noted that U. S. inflation had been influenced relatively more by commodity price fluctuations in recent years; because commodity prices reflect global economic conditions, U. S. inflation might be less affected by domestic factors and more linked to the global outlook than in the past."
"In contrast, consumer energy prices continued to rise rapidly in October, and spot prices of imported crude oil moved higher, on net, during November and early December."
The increase in the employment cost index for private compensation over the third quarter was a bit below the average pace of the last two years.
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes moved up, on balance, over the intermeeting period, and one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index moved down on net."
"Most participants anticipated that inflation would fall back from recent elevated levels as the effects of higher energy prices waned, and still expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate."
"Manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles increased solidly, likely reflecting stronger demand for materials from the motor vehicle sector and a slower pace of inventory liquidation elsewhere."
Growth in labor demand had been outpacing sustainable increases in labor supply; these reports suggested that the risk of an acceleration in labor compensation was rising.
Slackening demand from institutional investors was cited as another factor behind the decline in home sales.
"For the Japanese economy, which had been the notable exception among the foreign industrial economies, there were indications of some strengthening of aggregate demand during the first five months of the year."
"Looking ahead, slower growth in economic activity would tend to hold down pressures on wages and prices during 1999 and imports from Asian and other depressed economies would continue to generate intense competition in many markets; but labor markets remained tight, energy and commodity prices could well turn up after substantial declines, and the recent depreciation of the dollar would lessen pressures from foreign competition."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance.
"Staff Economic OutlookIn the forecast prepared for the November FOMC meeting, the staff raised its projection for real GDP growth over the second half of 2009 but left the forecast for output growth in 2010 and 2011 roughly unchanged."
The funds rate averaged close to the Committee's target over the intermeeting interval despite very strong demands for additional currency and market liquidity through the year-end and a rapid unwinding thereafter.
"Meeting participants generally agreed that there was an ongoing need to evaluate the possible interactions between monetary policy decisions and financial stability, with some noting that adverse shocks to financial stability can affect progress toward the Committee's dual mandate."
"However, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower than in 2018, whether or not one accounted for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' benchmark revision to payroll employment, which was scheduled for early February."
Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
"Growth in consumer spending was expected to decline appreciably from its recent pace but to remain fairly brisk over the quarters ahead, supported by further projected gains in employment and incomes."
"In particular, accelerating labor productivity clearly had curbed the rise in unit labor costs and damped pressures on prices."
"Moreover, the evidence of a significant acceleration in hiring was still limited, and some members referred to the possibility that growth could falter, particularly if market yields were to rise sharply further."
"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
"That divergence appeared to have persisted in the first quarter, as indicators pointed to continued rapid economic growth in Canada and moderate expansion in Japan but somewhat anemic growth in Europe."
"Interpretation of the incoming data on core PCE inflation was complicated by changes in the definition of the core measure recently implemented by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, as well as by unusually low readings for some nonmarket components of the price index."
"In their discussion of business activity in their Districts, participants provided mixed reports on manufacturing, with a few areas that had been adversely affected by the downturn in energy prices reporting a modest pickup in output."
The staff next summarized some of the recent steps the System had taken to prepare further for the process of normalization of monetary policy.
"Since the current benchmark ranges had first been adopted in the mid-1990s, however, structural productivity growth had increased substantially, raising the expected rate of growth of money at price stability, other things equal."
"Price increases for non-energy services slowed early last year and remained modest throughout 2009, reflecting declining prices for housing services and perhaps the deceleration in labor costs."
It was also noted that the extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy could eventually lead to a buildup of financial imbalances.
"Some participants thought that increases in purchases of Treasury securities might have little or no effect on long-term interest rates unless the increases were very sizable, given the large amount of current and projected supply of Treasury securities."
"In this regard, some emphasized that financial conditions were very accommodative in terms of the ample availability of financing to most borrowers on very attractive terms and increases in equity prices."
"Some members noted that price increases would be held down for a while by the effects of the higher dollar, which had not worked their way fully through domestic prices."
"In the agricultural sector, high levels of domestic crop production and weak global demand had depressed commodity prices, and farm income was expected to decline."
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
Members of the Committee noted that monetary policy was not well equipped to promote the adjustment of external imbalances but could best contribute by maintaining an environment of price stability that would foster maximum sustainable economic growth.
Consumer price inflation picked up slightly in July and August from a slow rate of increase in each of the previous four months; reduced but still appreciable increases in food prices contributed to the larger advance in both months and a sizable rise in energy prices held up the consumer price index in August.
"Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in December, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5."
Economic growth in the United Kingdom moderated because of a slowdown in real estate and business activities.
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
"Total U. S. consumer prices in August, as measured by the PCE price index, were unchanged from 12 months earlier, reflecting large declines in consumer energy prices."
The employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry rose moderately in the fourth quarter of last year and for the year as a whole.
"Consumer energy prices rose in January after decreasing markedly in December, and survey data indicated that gasoline prices moved up considerably in February and early March."
Broad stock price indexes fell over the intermeeting period on perceptions of a deteriorating economic outlook and additional write-downs by financial institutions.
"Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response to the statement's references to increased price pressures and to more evident pricing power as well as to the Committee's conditioning of its risk assessment on ""appropriate monetary policy action. """
"A reacceleration of food and energy prices helped push up inflation abroad, albeit generally to still-moderate levels, in the third quarter."
"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw a continuation of its existing policy stance as providing a degree of support to the economic expansion that was still appropriate."
"In their discussion of monetary policy, some participants expressed the view that in the context of increased inflation risks and roughly balanced risks to economic growth, the Committee would need to be prepared to begin taking steps toward less-accommodative policy."
"Meanwhile, measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined somewhat, with some of the decline occurring following the weaker-than-expected September CPI release."
"Several participants took note of the revisions to historical data that painted a more worrisome picture of cost trends; measures of unit labor costs had been marked up, reflecting upward revisions to labor compensation and downward revisions to labor productivity."
That growth was concentrated among large domestic banks and non-European foreign institutions.
Somewhat higher ranges would more comfortably encompass the anticipated growth of the monetary aggregates and in their view would conform more closely with the provisions and intent of the Federal Reserve Act that require the System to communicate its objectives and plans for monetary growth to the Congress.
"However, measures of core consumer price inflation were much more restrained."
The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"Reflecting the improved conditions in funding markets, demand for dollars at ECB lending operations declined and the outstanding amounts drawn under the Federal Reserve's dollar liquidity swap lines with other foreign central banks remained small."
"In particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending remained prominent."
"Some participants also expected the anticipated slight easing of pressures on resources to help nudge inflation lower, although others felt that small movements in resource utilization were unlikely to have discernible effects on inflation."
"In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that housing activity was likely to remain a substantial drag on economic growth over the next few quarters."
"However, businesses also indicated that concerns about actual and anticipated demand were important factors limiting investment and hiring."
"The civilian unemployment rate fell sharply, to 4."
"The inflation forecast for the rest of 2020 was revised down slightly in response to incoming data, and inflation was projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of labor- and product-market slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020."
House prices continued to increase despite a rise in the proportion of properties sold through foreclosures or short sales.
"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
"Even so, real GDP growth was still forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, primarily reflecting continued soft business investment and a slower increase in government spending."
The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
"Continued strength in home construction did not suggest that households were in the process of retrenching, and gains in income, low interest rates, and robust consumer confidence were seen as undergirding further gains in household spending going forward."
"Looking beyond the near term, a number of members, noting that core measures of consumer prices had been rising more rapidly this year, were concerned that these prices might well continue to accelerate gradually, even assuming that economic expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's potential."
"Moreover, several participants noted positive reports on residential construction activity from business contacts in their Districts, with a few suggesting that shortages of lots and skilled labor, rather than low demand, might be contributing to the recent slowing."
"Broad U. S. stock price indexes fell over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting deepening concerns about the European fiscal situation and its potential for adverse spillovers to global economic growth."
"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined, on balance, over the past two months but remained well above the national average."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
"Measures of longer-term inflation compensation declined, returning to around the middle of their recent elevated range."
"Consumer price inflation had remained at a low level in recent months, reflecting a variety of influences including a favorable labor cost environment, falling import prices, small increases in energy prices, and declining inflation expectations."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
"On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years--reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases--could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity."
"Although risks to the global economy had increased in recent months and financial markets were unusually volatile at times, she believed that monetary policy should focus primarily on progress toward the Committee's longer-run objectives."
"With regard to the funds rate, Mr. Lacker was concerned that linking the forward guidance to a specific numerical level of the unemployment rate would inhibit the effectiveness of the Committee's communications and increase the potential for inflationary policy errors; he preferred qualitative guidance instead."
"At the producer level, prices of finished goods dropped appreciably in August, largely reflecting declines in the prices of finished foods and, notably, energy goods."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"For example, the minimum bid rate in repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to the level of the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER rate)."
Export growth was subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital goods.
"In his judgment, the credibility of the Committee's 2 percent inflation target was at risk, calling for a more accommodative policy stance."
Participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the Committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in the context of the ample-reserves regime that the Committee had chosen.
"In Japan, however, economic activity was sluggish, with a seemingly small rise in the fourth quarter following a third-quarter decline."
"In that regard, participants discussed how the Committee's communications might evolve over coming meetings if the economy progressed about as anticipated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the postmeeting statement indicating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
"On a 12âmonth basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below 2 percent."
One participant pointed to those uncertainties as instead supporting the use of thresholds as a way of managing potential inflation risks associated with additional accommodation.
They also observed that it might be possible to adopt strategies that provide incentives for banks to reduce their demand for reserves.
"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, U. S. inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and pass-through of higher energy costs."
"Other possibilities included economic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable, widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as households and businesses relax or modify social-distancing behaviors."
A couple of participants commented that recent strong growth in GDP may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economy's productive capacity.
"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated."
"In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, the Committee agreed that the data received over the intermeeting period suggested that economic growth had moderated somewhat."
"Although the risks to GDP growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks, these risks were considered to be more nearly balanced than in the previous projection."
"Looking forward, strong business balance sheets and high profitability were seen as supporting continued growth in expenditures on software and equipment."
"At the producer level, price inflation for finished goods other than food and energy items slowed appreciably in October from the elevated September rate, which had been boosted by the tobacco price increase."
"Real disposable personal income was little changed in the fourth quarter, held down by higher consumer energy prices."
"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed."
Federal Reserve communications garnered significant attention from market participants over the period but appeared to have only a modest net effect on their expectations for monetary policy.
"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.
"After strong increases in the first half of 2006, real spending on equipment and software remained robust into the summer against a backdrop of rising business output, plentiful corporate cash reserves, positive sentiment among executives, and falling relative prices for high-tech equipment."
Relatively tight profit margins and less ebullient growth in wealth were among the factors expected to be damping investment and consumption.
"The available indicators of spending, particularly those for consumption and business investment, suggested that economic activity in the first half of the year had been somewhat firmer than previously expected."
Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended lower over the intermeeting period and were at a level consistent with further moderate job gains.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as elevated and the risks skewed to the downside, largely reflecting concerns about the situation in Europe and the possibility of a more severe tightening in U. S. fiscal policy than anticipated."
"However, several others continued to see downside risks to inflation, citing the decline in inflation expectations and the risk of adverse shocks to U. S. economic activity from developments abroad."
Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
"In particular, the growth of U. S. exports was expected to accelerate somewhat in association with some strengthening on average in the economies of the nation's key trading partners."
Standard statistical measures that pointed to relatively limited increases in productivity seemed inconsistent with strong profits as well as with anecdotal reports of sizable gains associated with widespread business restructuring activities and large additions of high-technology equipment to an increasingly efficient capital stock.
"0 percent over the 12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year."
"In the January SLOOS, banks reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for CRE lending and noted stronger demand for all CRE loan types."
"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2006 and 2007."
The staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the Committee's longer-run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019.
"Against this background, the prospects for continued low inflation remained favorable, given the currently reduced utilization of resources and indeed the prospect for some added slack should economic growth remain below potential in coming quarters, as many members anticipated."
"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000."
Broader measures of underemployment that include marginally attached workers and those employed part time for economic reasons also fell substantially since January.
"With the stance of monetary policy currently quite accommodative, the members saw the need for careful monitoring of the potential for rising inflation pressures as the economic recovery gained momentum."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
Participants discussed a number of issues relating to broader monetary policy strategy.
"Although participants considered it quite unlikely that the economy would slide back into recession, some noted that continued slow growth and high levels of resource slack could leave the economic expansion vulnerable to negative shocks."
Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period.
"In this view, longer-run concerns about rising inflation could be addressed in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting."
"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening."
"However, other members thought the evidence for a balanced risk assessment was not yet compelling and pointed out that with inflation quite low and slack in labor and output markets likely to persist for a while longer, the costs to the economy associated with a further decline in inflation likely outweighed those associated with a comparable increase."
"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
"However, widespread shutdowns together with lower commodity prices and tighter financial conditions suggested that activity was weakening sharply in most foreign economies."
"Most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years."
"Beyond the nearer term, however, the favorable outlook for productivity growth and related profit opportunities pointed to a revival of robust capital spending."
"However, the Mexican economy contracted in the third quarter, as hurricanes and earthquakes disrupted economic activity."
Meeting participants generally noted that overall labor market conditions had shown no improvement or had deteriorated in recent months and the unemployment rate remained elevated.
"The monetary policies of other advanced-economy central banks remained quite accommodative, and some signs of progress on central banks' inflation mandates were evident."
"Inflation was projected to remain subdued this year, reflecting the substantial amount of slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year."
"However, for the twelve months ended in May, core producer inflation was up noticeably compared with the year-earlier period, owing in important part to sharp increases in the prices of tobacco products."
"Core inflation and other indicators of underlying inflation over the medium term had increased modestly in recent months, but their levels remained subdued."
"Activity in the housing market continued to be depressed by weak demand, uncertainty about future home prices, tight credit conditions for mortgages and construction loans, and a substantial inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties."
The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates.
"Over the period, market participants seemed to conclude that monetary policy in Europe was likely to be put on a more accommodative path, and 10-year yields in Germany and the United Kingdom declined further."
"Even so, a number of factors suggested that the risks from higher interest rates might not be large."
Participants also noted that the slowing pace of employment declines mainly reflected a diminished pace of layoffs; few firms were hiring.
"Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
"The broad-based deceleration in underlying inflation was also apparent in other measures, such as the trimmed-mean PCE price index and a diffusion index of PCE price changes."
Reinforcing the Committee's forward guidance about the likely path of monetary policy was seen as a possible way to reduce interest rates and provide greater support to the economic expansion; a few participants emphasized that guidance focusing solely on the state of the economy would be preferable to guidance that named specific spans of time or calendar dates.
"And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services."
"Manufacturing production remained weak, and continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term."
"However, businesses particularly exposed to the appreciation of the dollar or falling commodity prices--including those in the heavy equipment and steel, oil and gas extraction, and petrochemical industries--reported slower activity."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"More generally, participants stressed there was considerable uncertainty as to the probable pace and extent of the moderation in core inflation and that the risks around this desired downward path remained to the upside."
Household spending was supported by moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a wealth-to-income ratio that remained high even after recent declines in equity values.
A number of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced.
"In 2014, economic activity was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by a lessening in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial conditions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.
The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through 2022 and to remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
"They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
Recent information continued to indicate a slight pickup in price inflation.
Members referred to the contrast between their current policy expectations and the typical experience during earlier cyclical upturns when it was felt that policy adjustments needed to be made quite promptly to gain greater assurance that inflation would not rise from what were already relatively elevated levels.
Several participants cited low nominal wage growth as pointing to the existence of continued labor market slack.
Many participants noted that the extent to which the increase in core inflation so far this year reflected transitory or persistent influences remained unclear.
"Consumer price inflation remained elevated in July, reflecting further increases in energy prices and shelter costs."
Real spending on drilling and mining structures picked up strongly over the second half of last year in response to the rebound in oil and natural gas prices.
"Nevertheless, economic activity still appeared to have declined at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter."
"Accordingly, it appeared appropriate to characterize inflation expectations again as ""contained. """
"To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November."
"Shipments of nondefense capital goods, notably of computing equipment whose prices continued to fall sharply, strengthened substantially in January and February."
"The rate of long-duration unemployment stayed elevated, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still high."
"Monetary policy remained very accommodative in most advanced economies, but central banks in some emerging market economies recently tightened policy further to contain inflation and support the foreign exchange value of their currencies."
"Moreover, as the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated, improvements in productivity growth might permit the economy to continue to accommodate strong demand for some time without generating higher inflation, especially if the growth of demand were to moderate somewhat in the months ahead."
"Growth in consumer spending remained moderate despite the effects of higher gasoline and food prices, which appeared to have largely offset the increase in disposable income from the payroll tax cut."
"Nonetheless, the pickup in the pace of the economic expansion was expected to be limited, reflecting the effects of high energy prices, modest changes in housing wealth, subdued real income gains, and fiscal contraction at the federal, state, and local levels."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would strengthen."
"On a 12âmonth basis, headline PCE price inflation had edged above the Committee's 2 percent objective in February, but this measure dropped back to 1."
They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced.
"Although the support for economic activity provided by low interest rates enhances financial stability, low interest rates also could eventually contribute to excessive borrowing or risk-taking and possibly leave some aspects of the financial system vulnerable to a future rise in interest rates."
"In addition, growth of M3 was sustained by large flows into institution-only money market funds as the yields on those funds caught up to earlier increases in short-term market rates."
"Price inflation remained subdued despite high rates of resource utilization, notably that of labor."
"Furthermore, a pattern observed in previous years of the current expansion was that the first quarter of the year tended to have weaker seasonally adjusted readings on economic growth than did the subsequent quarters."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
One participant emphasized the role of recent asset purchases in keeping inflation from declining further below the Committee's longer-run goal.
"Financial conditions, however, became somewhat more supportive of economic growth."
"In addition, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose in the first few weeks of October, likely reflecting, in part, some spillover effects from the government shutdown."
"6 percent, continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent; core PCE price inflation for items other than consumer food and energy prices was only 1."
A key issue was the extent to which this spring's increase in inflation reflected transitory or persistent influences.
The slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace near the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening price pressures and provided the Committee with a desirable opportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the course of economic activity and inflation.
It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
"Increases in core consumer prices had slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices."
A couple of others noted that business investment growth can be volatile on a quarterly basis and factors such as the recent cuts in corporate taxes and high levels of business sentiment were expected to support investment going forward.
"Share prices in equity markets have increased considerably over the period, with some stock price indexes reaching new highs."
"Subsequent communications--including the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Chair's semiannual testimony to the Congress, and speeches by FOMC participantsâwere interpreted as reflecting a patient approach to monetary policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction by the end of this year."
Measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable.
"However, one participant mentioned the difficult pricing decisions of manufacturers who face a combination of elevated input costs along with weakening demand for their products."
"However, downward revisions to foreign growth forecasts for the balance of this year implied continuing restraint on the expansion in foreign demand for U. S. goods and services."
The demand for labor appeared to moderate as hiring stepped down in recent months.
"An underlying factor in the good inflation performance of recent years and its extension into the future was the continuing absence of pricing power throughout the economy, evidently related in part to increased price competition in markets around the world stemming from globalization."
"Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded."
A couple of participants remarked on the apparent disparity between market-based measures of expected future U. S. short-term interest rates and projections for short-term rates based on surveys or based on the median of federal funds rate projections in the SEP. One participant noted that very low term premiums in market-based measures might explain at least some portion of this gap.
"On balance, while the risks of an overheat- ing economy and rising price inflation might have faded to some degree, many of the members continued to emphasize that the Committee could not ignore those risks in its policy formulation."
"The cumulative effects of an accommodative monetary policy, likely further reduction in taxes, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending."
Participants discussed the medium-term outlook for monetary policy and issues related to monetary policy implementation.
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
"Over the remainder of the period, however, most interest rates moved higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting improved prospects for economic growth and, accordingly, a reduced likelihood of further easings in monetary policy."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"However, indicators of economic activity in the euro area remained weak, and Chinese economic data for July and August suggested some slowing in the third quarter."
"Banks also reported that demand for some categories of RRE loans weakened during the first quarter, including those insured or guaranteed by government agencies."
"Nonetheless, the reported rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months could presage a broader increase in job growth and thus was a welcome development."
"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the projection for the April meeting."
Foreign economic growth had slowed in recent months and the dollar had risen broadly; both of these developments suggested that the contributions to U. S. GDP growth from net exports would likely be less strong than it had been of late.
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
The municipal bond market appeared to continue to price in an atypically high level of default risk.
Continued concerns about the outlook for global economic growth weighed on commodity and foreign equity prices early in the intermeeting period.
"Real PCE rose briskly in July, while the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE were flat in August and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles only edged up, suggesting some slowing in consumer spending growth in the third quarter from its strong second-quarter pace."
Several suggested that slowing growth in the United States and abroad made a new surge in commodity prices unlikely.
"Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators--such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers' perceptions of the labor market--remained positive."
"Strong demands for bank credit, funded by the issuance of large time deposits and other liabilities not included in M2, underlaid the acceleration in M3."
"Consumer energy prices climbed markedly in February and March, although survey data indicated that gasoline prices stepped down in the first half of April."
"Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained."
"Most participants continued to anticipate that the recovery in economic activity was likely to be restrained by a variety of economic factors, including still-high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, high rates of mortgage foreclosure, elevated inventories of unsold homes, and tight credit conditions in a number of sectors."
"Nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially further in October and November, and the civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4."
Such a directive would be consistent with the Committee's judgment that the information that had become available since a symmetric directive was last adopted in February had altered the inflation risks enough to make some tightening a likely prospect in the not too distant future.
The employment cost index for total labor compensation in the private sector increased 2.
"While recent monthly readings indicated that core inflation had been subdued, a number of participants noted that underlying core inflation appeared to be running at a pace around the upper end of the range they viewed as consistent with price stability-an assessment that was reinforced by the recent upward revisions to historical data on core PCE inflation."
Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased slightly from near multiyear low levels.
"Recent information on economic activity in the G-7 countries suggested continued expansion at a moderate rate on average in early 1997, but rates of expansion had continued to diverge among those economies."
"In addition, several viewed the downside risks from weaker economic activity abroad as having diminished somewhat."
The potential for an escalation in tariffs or trade tensions was also cited as a factor that could slow economic growth more than expected.
"In South America, activity was strong, boosted by high prices for commodities and, in Argentina and Venezuela, by expansionary macroeconomic policies."
"A shift to inventory stocking in the near term, possibly in the current quarter, was seen as a reasonable expectation, but with numerous firms having already moved production into closer alignment with sales, members anticipated much less impetus to overall economic activity from inventories over coming quarters."
Major indexes of stock market prices fluctuated substantially over the period but they rose considerably on balance.
The members believed that growth in labor compensation was likely to remain under upward pressure from the anticipated persistence of very tight conditions in labor markets that would enable wages to catch up to earlier gains in labor productivity.
"However, a number of firms outside of the housing sector--including auto companies--appeared to have made progress in reducing inventories to more comfortable levels, and contacts in the industrial sector were generally optimistic about future growth."
"A number of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year, albeit probably at a slower pace than in 2018."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic growth remains slow."
"Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains, averaging 200, 000 per month."
"Some saw inflation leveling out near desired levels, while others expressed concern that inflation might decline below levels consistent with price stability in the medium term."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in February.
"Evidence was mixed on whether the acceleration in productivity was persisting, but the earlier favorable developments in import prices were already dissipating, adding to the inflation risk posed by the possibility of further tightening in labor markets should domestic demand fail to moderate."
The declines in equity prices had been accompanied by a heightened degree of risk aversion that had led to widened credit spreads in financial markets and the curtailment of credit availability to potential borrowers whose repayment prospects were viewed as questionable.
"The overall rise in production had been held down recently by supply disruptions in the motor vehicles industry, but employment had continued to expand at a strong pace and the unemployment rate was at a low level."
"In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
Growth in private nonfarm payroll employment moderated a little further on balance in October and November.
"In recent weeks, oil prices had begun to fall and readings from the oil futures market suggested this may continue; non-energy commodity prices had remained relatively stable."
Prices of risky assets and advanced-economy bond yields also fell in response to the heightened uncertainty and expectations of slower economic growth.
"The Michigan survey measure of median longer-run inflation expectations moved down in October to a new historical low, and the longer-run measure from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators also declined slightly."
"In that regard, while some participants interpreted the recent readings on survey-based measures of inflation expectations and market-based measures of inflation compensation as suggesting that long-term inflation expectations were still relatively well anchored, some others expressed concern about the further decline in inflation compensation recently and the historically low levels of some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations."
"Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs of services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost to core consumer price inflation in December."
They observed that the Committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"Incoming data suggested a weaker near-term outlook for economic growth, but the Committee's earlier policy moves had already reduced the target federal funds rate by 225 basis points to address risks to growth, and the full effect of those rate cuts had yet to be felt."
"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection."
They cautioned that postponing policy firming for too long could push the unemployment rate markedly below its longer-run normal rate over the next few years.
"In addition, several saw developments in Iraq and Ukraine as posing possible downside risks to global economic activity or potential upside risks to world oil prices."
"Financial market conditions continued to improve, providing support to aggregate demand and suggesting that market participants saw some reduction in downside risks to the outlook: Equity prices rose further, credit spreads declined somewhat, and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period."
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand briskly.
"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time."
"The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
"The forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 was little revised, as the positive effects of a slightly lower assumed path for interest rates and a stronger trajectory for household wealth were mostly offset by the restraint from a weaker outlook for foreign GDP growth and a slightly stronger path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
"In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
Meeting participants generally agreed that the uncertainty surrounding the outlook was considerable and that downside risks to even this weak trajectory for economic activity were a serious concern.
"On a 12âmonth basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."
Investors took particular note of the statement's indication that inflation was below the levels consistent with the FOMC's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.
Inflation Analysis and Forecasting The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting.
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p. m. : ""The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"Although some participants noted that growth in consumer spending so far this year had not been as vigorous as they had anticipated, they attributed the shortfall in part to unusually bad weather."
"In Japan, a mild second-quarter pause after very rapid first-quarter growth had been followed by renewed expansion."
"The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down, mostly because of the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
Participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting.
"However, the course of oil prices was very difficult to predict not only because of political and market uncertainties but in part also because of the lack of information about the extent of what appeared to be a precautionary buildup of fuel supplies by households and retail businesses."
"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential."
"While spending for final goods and services by U. S. residents decelerated noticeably, inventory investment strengthened and the deficit in international trade in goods and services appeared to have narrowed."
"These arrangements, which predated the North American Framework Agreement, were linked into a trilateral facility in connection with the establishment of the North American Financial Group in 1994 to facilitate consultation and cooperation among the three countries in the area of macroeconomic policy as an outgrowth of the increasing integration of those economies expected to result from the North American Free Trade Agreement."
"A few participants acknowledged there could be structural factors at work, but said that in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that unemployment was still elevated."
"In doing so, the Desk will need to assess banks' demand for reserves as well as forecast other Federal Reserve liabilities and plan operations to maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that control over short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates."
"Most participants continued to expect core inflation to slow gradually, although considerable uncertainty surrounded that judgment and the Committee's predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected."
"In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period."
"Asset prices moved in response to economic data releases that were, on balance, a little stronger than expected and to Federal Reserve communications."
"Several participants noted that the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months had been accompanied by a fall in the labor force participation rate, particularly among those with a high school education or lower and among women."
"The staff projection prepared for the meeting pointed to modest expansion in real GDP in the first half of 2008 followed by a slight slowdown in growth in the second half, when several factors were likely to restrain spending, including lower household wealth, slower real income growth due to sharply higher oil prices, and tight credit conditions."
"The members agreed that despite the increasing evidence of some acceleration in the expansion of economic activity, an accommodative policy stance remained appropriate in the context of the currently large and persisting margins of unemployed labor and other resources and very low inflation."
"Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states."
"Some participants noted, however, that the erosion of consumer confidence, still-elevated gasoline prices, and the prospect of higher heating bills might augur weakness ahead."
Core producer prices increased considerably less over the twelve months ended in April than over the previous twelve months.
"Equity prices were mixed in emerging markets, and credit spreads on emerging market sovereign debt edged up."
The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.
A mild downturn in overall economic activity probably was now under way and business conditions would continue to be depressed for some uncertain period by the sharp further deterioration in business and consumer confidence triggered by the terrorist attacks.
"In addition, the economy appeared to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization and had been growing quite strongly, and whether economic growth would moderate to a sustainable pace was not yet clear."
"Over the remainder of the intermeeting period, though, expectations of policy tightening were revised down somewhat, on balance, as incoming data pointed to weaker-than-anticipated spending and employment and more subdued core inflation."
Participants again emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the prospects for changes in fiscal and other government policies as well as about the timing and magnitude of the net effects of such changes on economic activity.
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and non-energy import prices."
"Thereafter, economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by an eventual easing in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit conditions, and continued accommodative monetary policy."
"The household wealth-to-income ratio likely ticked down in the first quarter, as the stock market rose only a little and house prices remained soft."
"They favored a stronger action to better address the stubbornly low inflation rates of the past several years, recognizing that the apparent low sensitivity of inflation to levels of resource utilization meant that a notably stronger real economy might be required to speed the return of inflation to the Committee's inflation objective."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared for the August FOMC meeting, the staff lowered its projection for the increase in real economic activity during the second half of 2010 but continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little, on balance, in recent months."
"A pause in the expansion was not an unusual development during the early stages of a cyclical recovery, and the members generally viewed a pickup in growth as a reasonable expectation."
"However, a couple of members preferred to include language in the statement indicating that the Committee would keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
The Treasury bill market was particularly affected as yields on bills maturing between mid-October and early November rose sharply and some bill auctions saw reduced demand.
"On the other hand, from a business cycle perspective, the increase in the participation rate in recent months was consistent with a tightening labor market and an economy nearing full employment; furthermore, it was not clear that output growth above the economy's potential growth rate would succeed in drawing new entrants permanently into the labor force."
"Price inflation had remained moderate in recent months, with the exception of higher energy prices."
Most participants noted that unusually severe winter weather had held down economic activity during the early months of the year.
"Growth in unit labor costs had continued to be held down by growth of output per hour worked, which had continued to perform surprisingly well."
The Committee then continued its discussion of communication issues and considered the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying an inflation objective.
The expansion in economic output over the medium term was anticipated to trim resource slack; the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
The staff projected that consumer price inflation would move down over the near term by more than in the previous projection.
"Nonetheless, inflation could edge lower and the Committee needed to be cognizant of the risk of substantial further disinflation, which could have potentially adverse effects."
Participants generally continued to anticipate that the growth of real GDP would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further thereafter.
"Meanwhile, yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined by smaller amounts, leaving inflation compensation lower."
"Exports declined, on balance, to the lowest level in three years; lower prices for commodities, along with reduced shipments of capital and consumer goods, weighed on nominal exports."
"A number of participants viewed the recent run-up in petroleum prices as likely to limit gains in consumer spending on non-energy items for a time; a couple of participants noted, however, that the unseasonably warm weather and the declining price of natural gas had helped cushion the effect of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers' overall energy bills."
"However, other participants indicated that such concerns were not new and that much of the current elevated level of unemployment reflected cyclical factors, with one pointing to the lack of wage pressures as evidence."
"Moreover, it was difficult to anticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect inflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become embedded more generally in the price structure."
A number of participants noted that recent movements in interest rates and other indicators suggested that financial markets viewed the Committee's tools--asset purchases and forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate--as closely linked.
"Consumer price inflation was still running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by decreases in both energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports."
"Finally, high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations could lead to losses of skills and greater needs for labor reallocation that could slow employment growth."
"Nonetheless, some large U. S. banks had seen further pressure on their stock prices and CDS spreads."
Easing would help limit the extent of the downturn and later provide impetus to the eventual upturn in economic activity.
"While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further."
"But if the unusually rapid productivity growth seen in recent quarters was not sustained, then job growth could pick up significantly as productivity returned to sustainable levels."
"Against this backdrop, nearly all members judged that leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting was appropriate and would most effectively promote progress toward the Committee's dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
"By contrast, France and Italy had experienced little, if any, growth since early in the year."
"More recently, survey data through the middle of April pointed to additional increases in retail gasoline prices, while increases in the prices of food commodities appeared to have moderated somewhat."
"The producer price index for core intermediate materials dropped for a fifth month in February, reflecting, in part, weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such as chemicals and plastics."
"Overall, many participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlooks as being roughly balanced."
"In this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits."
Some added that inflation remained quiescent and the near-term onset of an appreciable slowing of the expansion to a rate more in line with the economy's potential could not be ruled out.
"Against the background of better-than-expected incoming economic data and of favorable news on military operations in Afghanistan, short-term interest rates declined a little over the intermeeting interval while intermediate- and long-term Treasury rates rose substantially."
The unemployment rate fell to 7.
"District contacts were optimistic, and their reports were generally consistent with continued steady growth in business spending."
"However, some participants cautioned that commodity prices had remained stubbornly high for quite some time and that inferences drawn in the past from futures markets about likely trends in such prices had often proven inaccurate."
The proposal was designed to allow the Manager a wider choice of maturities and hence somewhat greater operational flexibility in the implementation of the System's primary portfolio objectives of liquidity with respect to investments in foreign government securities and limits on overall interest rate and credit risks.
Labor demand continued to weaken in March.
Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.
Stock prices for domestic commercial banks were volatile but outperformed broad indexes on balance.
"The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only slightly."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
The resulting impetus to exports was projected to be accompanied by a lower rate of growth in imports as the expansion of the U. S. economy slowed.
"In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong employment gains, low levels of unemployment in their Districts, reports of shortages of workers in various industries, or firming in wage increases."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Markets in the major trading nations around the world were likely to remain on the soft side, with Japan struggling to recover from its ongoing recession and economic growth in Europe showing signs of becoming more sluggish."
The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both edged up in September.
"In Japan, exports continued to support economic growth, even as indicators of household spending remained weak."
"A couple of participants reported plans for a pickup in capital spending by businesses in their Districts, driven by stronger demand and increasing revenues."
Job growth remained brisk in the services sector despite a further drop in employment at temporary help agencies that might have reflected constraints on the availability of workers for hire.
"Most participants expected core inflation to edge lower, in part as the effects of the run-up in energy prices in recent years waned."
"Should the economy display unanticipated strength in the near term, the emerging need for a tightening action would be a highly welcome development that could be readily accommodated in a timely manner to forestall any potential pickup in inflation."
"The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1996 as a whole had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, reflecting expectations of considerable moderation in the rate of economic growth over the second half of the year; for 1997, the projections centered on continued moderate growth of GDP in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent."
The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that for an extended period most forecasters had been projecting slower economic growth and higher inflation than actually had materialized."
Such a bias had been seen as consistent with the members' views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.
"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
"With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. """
"Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations."
"Nonetheless, members generally judged that the economic outlook had softened somewhat more than they had anticipated, particularly for the near term, and some saw increased downside risks to the outlook for both growth and inflation."
"The moderation in the expansion of final demand in recent months, together with still relatively robust growth in employment and production, suggested that inventory investment had picked up since the second quarter."
"Labor demand rose further in recent months, but unemployment stayed at a high level."
"Although some energy prices had recently increased, many participants judged that the favorable trends in commodity prices might persist in the near term, particularly in light of softer global activity, and one noted that expanded crop production, if realized, would hold down agricultural prices."
"Looking further ahead, consumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more in line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in recent years."
"Incoming data suggested that economic activity in the emerging market economies slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, with real gross domestic product (GDP) plunging in several Asian economies and appearing little changed in China."
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes increased slightly, on net, as generally positive corporate earnings news and an easing of investors' worries about the potential effects of fiscal strains in Europe were partly offset by concerns about the strength of the economic recovery."
"However, many participants continued to see a larger gap between current labor market conditions and those consistent with their assessments of normal levels of labor utilization than indicated by the difference between the unemployment rate and estimates of its longer-run normal level."
"The growth of consumer lending at banks continued in January and February, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 2016. Financing conditions for consumers remained accommodative except in the market for subprime credit card loans."
"Perhaps partly for that reason, a number of participants indicated that growth in economic activity during the first half of this year was somewhat below their earlier expectations."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales.
"In the agricultural sector, crop yields were healthy, farmland values were up, and lower crop prices were increasing the affordability of livestock feed."
Residential construction activity was expected to moderate a bit over coming quarters as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates exerted its lagged effects.
"The Committee expected inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remained highly uncertain."
"Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
"The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and to retain the ""measured pace"" language was widely expected in financial markets."
Many members thought that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic activity evolved as they expected.
"However, a couple of participants noted that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to higher future consumption growth."
"However, the recent increase in mortgage purchase applications was seen as suggesting that the demand for housing was being driven by factors beyond low mortgage rates."
"In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near-record levels of job openings and help-wanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months."
Some noted the difficulty of distinguishing declines in expected inflation embedded in those market-based measures from changes in risk and liquidity premiums or of interpreting the current high correlation of far-forward measures of inflation compensation and oil prices.
All participants agreed that the completion of the framework review and the publication of the revised consensus statement provided a strong foundation for monetary policy decisions and communications going forward.
Incoming data for the second quarter pointed to a pickup in economic growth in the euro area and Japan but indicated that growth slowed somewhat in Canada.
"In July and August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while commercial and industrial loan growth moderated."
"Looking beyond the near term, members expressed considerable uncertainty about the prospective strength of final demand."
"In addition, private final demand would be restrained a bit by the tighter terms and conditions that were now imposed by many types of lenders and by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier increases in equity prices."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
Another concern mentioned was the increasing risk of a buildup of financial imbalances after a prolonged period of very low interest rates.
"The total outstanding amount on the Federal Reserve's dollar liquidity swap lines declined to $32 billion, down from $65 billion at the time of the March FOMC meeting; demand for dollars fell at the lending operations of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank."
Among those risks was the possibility that additional downward shocks to prices of oil and other commodities or a sustained rise in the exchange value of the dollar could delay or diminish the expected upturn in inflation.
"On the other hand, economic activity could recover more quickly if the pandemic subsided enough for households and businesses to become sufficiently confident to relax or modify social-distancing behaviors over the next several months."
"Although economic activity was being damped by the efforts of businesses to pare excess inventories, the substantial drawdown in inventories over recent months was viewed as raising the prospects for a gradual expansion in industrial production later this year."
Consumer spending was expected to grow in line with disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer concerns about job security and the influence of already-high household debt burdens.
"On balance, as evidenced by anecdotal reports from some areas, various factors including ongoing growth in employment and incomes, the availability of financing on still generally favorable terms, and the associated affordability of housing for many homeowners seemed likely to provide continued support for this sector of the economy for some period of time."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
"By contrast, participants expressed a range of concerns about using open market operations aimed at affecting the expected path of short-term interest rates, such as a standing purchase facility for shorter-term Treasury securities or the provision of term funding through repurchase agreements."
The civilian unemployment rate climbed to 8.
"Broad stock price indexes were volatile but about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period."
Headline consumer price inflation moved higher in September and October as energy prices increased significantly; core inflation also rose but remained moderate.
There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends.
"However, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures."
"Interest rates on Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and mortgages moved down further over the intermeeting period; the dollar reversed its April to June appreciation; and equity prices edged higher."
"Despite this improvement in risk sentiment, market participants expected weak overall growth in 2020, and elevated uncertainties in the outlook remained."
"Inflation was expected to rise, owing to the recent hikes in oil prices, but the increase should be limited."
"Notwithstanding the improved investor sentiment toward Europe, data releases pointing to lower-than-expected growth in economic activity in the United States and China may have weighed on global sovereign bond yields, which declined on net in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan."
"Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment were lower in February than they were late last year, although both measures were still high."
"In their discussion of potential risks, several participants commented on the rise in forward price-to-earnings ratios for some small-cap stocks, the increased level of equity repurchases, or the rise in margin credit."
"Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed."
Core PCE prices rose 0.
The decrease was made effective immediately and was passed through to interest rates in reserve markets.
"Equity market volatility moved down substantially over the remainder of the intermeeting period but remained elevated, and equity prices more than retraced their earlier declines to end the intermeeting period notably higher."
"The statement noted that the Committee would ""continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook"" and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. """
Financing conditions for businesses and households remained broadly supportive of continued growth in household spending and business investment.
Participants pointed to potential interactions between financial stresses and the housing market contraction as the primary source of continuing downside risks to growth.
"Accordingly, prospective growth in final demand would have to be met through increased production."
"Against this background, the members judged the currently accommodative stance of monetary policy to be appropriate for now, especially in light of the relatively high unemployment rate, low capacity utilization rates in numerous industries, and quiescent inflation pressures."
"In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective."
Broad stock price indexes moved higher.
The increase in equity prices reflected the apparent firming of the economic recovery and favorable early reports on fourth-quarter corporate earnings.
The unemployment rate declined to 6.
"In that regard, the prospective strength of demand pressures and related outlook for productivity were subject to a wide range of uncertainty, and there were reasons to believe that economic growth could well slow without any adjustment to policy."
"For the twelve months ended in May, core producer prices rose by a small amount after having changed little in the year-earlier period."
"With economic growth buoyed by accommodative monetary policy and supportive credit conditions more generally as well as by robust underlying growth in productivity, the Committee believed that conditions were in place for the pace of expansion to strengthen enough to continue to trim margins of slack in resource utilization."
"They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"The members also cited other factors that would tend to maintain some upward pressure on prices, notably the relatively rapid rise in costs of labor benefits, especially medical and pension benefits."
There was some concern that including such a summary sentence in the press release might be mistakenly interpreted as an indication of Committee concern about the outlook for economic activity rather than a judgment about the relative odds on further inflation.
These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
"Most members noted that recent readings on inflation, along with the strengthening of the economic outlook, provided support for the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"Although sales of new and existing homes turned up in August and September, the still-low level of demand suggested that the payback for the earlier boost to sales from the homebuyer tax credit had not yet faded."
"In particular, orders and shipments of equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sector registered a robust increase in July, and data on computer production and shipments of high-tech goods pointed to solid increases in business demand for high-tech."
"Participants remained concerned that the housing market correction could have a more pronounced impact on consumer spending than currently expected, especially if house prices were to decline significantly."
"In particular, in March the 12-month percent increase in PCE prices was equal to the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, while the measure excluding food and energy prices was only slightly below 2 percent."
"Nonetheless, low mortgage interest rates continued to provide important support to homebuilding, and in the absence of a much weaker economy than was currently anticipated or of a further sizable shock to consumer confidence, there appeared to be little basis in ongoing trends and housing finance conditions to expect substantial additional erosion in residential construction."
"In the circumstances, it appeared unlikely that growth in capital outlays would moderate appreciably for some time."
"On net, yields on longer-term Treasury securities fell notably, U. S. equity prices edged down, corporate bond spreads widened modestly, and the dollar appreciated moderately against most other currencies."
"Private nonfarm employment rose at a considerably slower pace in June and July than earlier in the year, and employment in state and local governments continued to trend lower."
"Although they expressed some uncertainty about the extent of the likely near-term pickup, members expected moderate economic growth over the medium term."
The unemployment rate edged down further to 8.
"Foreign inflation appeared to increase a little in the first quarter, partly as a result of higher food prices in several emerging market economies, but remained quite moderate."
"Indeed, many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993."
The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded robustly in June, as it did in May, but the gains in those two months offset only about one-third of the jobs lost in March and April."
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent."
"Despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, consumer price inflation remained subdued."
Changes in market quotes for inflation caps and floors suggested that the rise in inflation compensation reflected in part higher costs of protection against above-target inflation outcomes.
"By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12âmonth PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1."
"The substantial global supply of crude oil seemed likely to maintain downward pressure on energy prices for some time, leading to a deterioration in credit conditions for some U. S. producers and a further reduction in their capital outlays."
The staff's forecast continued to show subdued rates of headline and core inflation during 2011 and 2012.
The Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation expectations edged up in June and was unchanged in early July.
Several participants reported that uncertainty about the economic outlook was leading firms to defer spending projects until prospects for economic activity became clearer.
"Growth in consumer spending had slowed noticeably, and higher mortgage rates seemed to be exerting some modest restraint on housing demand."
The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated following the October FOMC meeting and the October employment report and ended the intermeeting period higher on balance.
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in April from its downward-revised average rate in the first quarter.
"At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
"Total PCE price inflation, as measured on a 12-month basis, continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective."
"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent."
"While resolution of some of the uncertainties relating to Iraq seemed likely in the relatively near term, many business contacts reported that they would continue to hold down their capital investments until demand for their goods and services and related profit opportunities displayed clear signs of significant improvement."
Several central banks announced monetary policy actions during the period.
"Broad stock price indexes moved within narrow ranges but were modestly lower, on net, over the intermeeting period."
"Participants remained concerned that the housing market correction could have a more pronounced impact on consumer spending than currently expected, especially if house prices were to decline significantly."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
"In contrast, real expenditures by state and local governments appeared to have declined further, as outlays for construction projects fell in March and April, and state and local employment continued to contract in April and May."
"Relatively strong demand for oil and other commodities abroad, as well as increased labor and other operating costs in the emerging economies, was boosting prices of globally traded goods and services."
"With the uncertainties in the outlook for both economic activity and inflation elevated, members noted that appropriately calibrating the stance of policy was difficult, partly because some time would be required to assess the effects of the substantial easing of policy to date."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"Housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated."
"Strength in consumer spending and further acceleration in capital investment sparked faster-than-expected growth in the third quarter, and relatively brisk economic expansion seemed to be in prospect for a period ahead in the context of very positive business and consumer sentiment, strong demands for capital goods, and favorable financial conditions."
"The small net decline in longer-term nominal Treasury yields over the period was attributable to a comparable drop in real yields, as longer-term inflation compensation measures based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation swaps were little changed on net."
Market participants pointed to flight-to-quality flows and greater concern about the economic outlook as factors boosting the demand for Treasury securities.
"Even if greater price inflation were averted under that scenario, the members saw a substantial risk that if economic growth did not slow in line with their current forecasts, the resulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate into higher price inflation."
"Recent statistics supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to persisting strength in housing activity, though there were indications of softness in high-priced homes in at least some parts of the country."
"Inflation also rose in many EMEs, in part because of rising food and fuel prices; however, inflation fell notably in much of South America."
"Notably, the low level of mortgage interest rates, reduced house prices, and the Administration's new programs to encourage mortgage refinancing and mitigate foreclosures ultimately could bring about a lower cost of homeownership, a sustained increase in home sales, and a stabilization of house prices."
"Emerging market currencies were generally resilient in recent weeks, reportedly benefiting from investors' anticipation of stronger global economic growth, after depreciating significantly against the dollar during the previous intermeeting period."
"The very limited available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro area and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery in Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia."
The staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained indefinitely.
The total PCE price index rose substantially in both February and March.
"Another key factor, though one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the persistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation, which remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels of unemployment."
"The increase in delinquencies on subprime adjustable-rate mortgage loans and the ensuing increase in interest rates and tightening of credit standards in the subprime mortgage market likely would constrain home purchases by some borrowers, perhaps retarding the recovery in the housing sector."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined somewhat, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
"1 percent in June, as a decline in the price index for core goods nearly offset a rise in the index for core services."
The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services edged up in April from the first-quarter rate.
The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low.
"Several participants noted that the agricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties, including those associated with trade developments, weak export demand, and challenging financial positions for many farmers."
The members anticipated that inflation as measured by the consumer price index would decline appreciably over 1997 as a result of favorable developments in the food and especially the energy sectors of the economy and declining import prices associated with the previous appreciation of the dollar.
"There were indications, however, of a gradually improving economic outlook in several of these economies in the first quarter as a consequence of previous monetary policy easing actions that their respective central banks had taken and from the effects of an improved economic performance in the United States."
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
"Despite tight job markets, labor compensation had been rising more slowly than last year."
A few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path.
CRE loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018.
Fiscal policy was viewed as likely to buoy the expansion of economic activity through 2004.
"These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"In contrast, a few participants cautioned that these financial market conditions might not deliver much impetus to aggregate demand if they instead reflected a more pessimistic assessment of prospects for longer-run economic growth and, accordingly, a view that the longer-run neutral rate of interest in the United States would remain low."
"However, the staff's projection for inflation over the medium term was essentially unchanged."
"Although equity markets were volatile, broad U. S. equity price indexes ended the intermeeting period little changed."
Members agreed that the statement should indicate that all available tools would be employed to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.
"Participants noted that banking institutions in a number of countries remained exposed to substantial further losses, and the process of repairing the balance sheets of such institutions would likely continue to restrain growth in those economies over coming quarters and hence damp the outlook for U. S. export demand."
"These measures include executing reverse repurchase agreements (RPs) on a large scale, potentially with counterparties other than the primary dealers; implementing a term deposit facility, available to depository institutions, to reduce the supply of reserve balances; and taking steps to tighten the link between the interest rate paid on reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve Banks and the federal funds rate."
"Recent data on consumer prices and unit labor costs led the staff to revise down slightly its projection for core PCE price inflation for 2010 and 2011; as before, core inflation was projected to be quite subdued at rates below last year's pace."
"Moreover, the increase in crude oil prices to record levels, together with rapid increases in food and import prices in recent months, was likely to put upward pressure on inflation over the next few quarters."
"The staff also continued to project that real GDP would accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
Economic growth in the major industrialized countries in the first quarter was uneven.
A few participants noted that some exits from the labor force may have been related to the loss or prospective loss of eligibility for emergency unemployment insurance benefits.
A smaller gap might increase the frequency of episodes in which policymakers would not be able to reduce the federal funds rate enough to promote a strong economic recovery and rapid return to maximum employment or to maintain price stability in the aftermath of negative shocks to aggregate demand.
Canada's growth seemed to continue to pick up from its disappointing rate posted in much of last year.
"Preliminary data indicated that growth in M2 picked up temporarily in early October amid uncertainty about the passage of debt limit legislation; deposits increased sharply as institutional investors appeared to shift from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible redemptions."
"Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period."
The average monthly increase in private payroll employment over the three months ending in August was small and was less than the average gain earlier in the year.
"Before the conservatorship announcement, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had declined less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving mortgage spreads at the top of their range of the past two decades."
"Financial markets also seemed a little less positive about the outlook, with stock prices lower and some risk spreads wider than at the time of the last meeting."
The U. S. international trade deficit rose to a record high level in January.
"However, in the context of the partial reversal recently of the previous increases in mortgage rates and sustained growth in employment and incomes, the housing sector was viewed as likely to exert only a minor constraint on overall economic activity over the forecast horizon."
"The Mexican peso changed little on balance, the Brazilian real firmed despite the deepening problems of Argentina, and the Korean won rose against the background of incoming data that suggested the persistence of resilient domestic demand."
"While he recognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view of recent financial and economic developments in East Asia, he believed these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would have to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed, demand remained robust, and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary expectations were reversed."
"Some participants noted that certain measures of the real federal funds rate, especially those using actual or forecasted headline inflation, were now negative, and very low by historical standards."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
"Financial market functioning was judged to have improved somewhat since the previous FOMC meeting, but the situation in a number of markets remained strained, and credit market conditions were thought likely to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions."
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to expand vigorously.
"The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen."
"In this regard, several participants stressed the economic and social costs of high unemployment, as well as the potential for negative effects on the economy's longer-term path of a prolonged period of underutilization of resources."
The unemployment rate decreased to 8.
"Over the period, bank equity prices rose, and credit default swap spreads on financial firms declined."
"However, later in the period, concerns among market participants about the implications of falling crude oil prices and the credit quality of high-yield bonds evidently increased."
"The U. S. international trade deficit reached a new record in April, reflecting in large part a sharp decline in exports of goods."
"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
"Partly in light of the likelihood that the recent higher readings on headline inflation had mostly reflected the temporary effect of increases in consumer energy prices, members agreed that the Committee would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its inflation goal."
"Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook."
"Spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed, consistent with the gains in equity prices, but were still wider than levels observed last fall."
Private payroll employment dropped considerably over the three months ending in February.
Members commented that inflation as reflected in a wide range of statistical measures and anecdotal reports remained remarkably subdued despite the persisting strength of the expansion and very tight labor markets across the nation.
Maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations would depend on the credibility of the Committee's commitment to deliver on the price stability part of its mandate.
"Following the discussion, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: ""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of overnight reverse repurchase operations involving U. S. government securities for the purpose of further assessing the appropriate structure of such operations in supporting the implementation of monetary policy during normalization."
"Estimates of such equilibrium real interest rates were highly uncertain, but some participants reported that their estimates were currently unusually low by historical standards, reflecting, for example, factors weighing persistently on aggregate demand."
The unemployment rate was projected to run a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
"Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these figures likely understated the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemployment rate by 5 percentage points in April and 3 percentage points in May."
"An unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent, with few signs of emerging price pressures, with growth in economic activity seen as likely to moderate appreciably from the unexpectedly strong and unsustainable pace of the fourth quarter, and with considerable uncertainty about future inflationary developments."
"Mr. Plosser felt that a maturity extension program would do little to improve near-term growth or employment, in light of the ongoing structural adjustments and fiscal challenges both in the United States and abroad."
"In addition, the staff discussed the risks to financial stability associated with the possibility of substantial unanticipated changes in longer-term U. S. interest rates, including the scope for a sharp increase in such rates to affect financial conditions in emerging market economies."
"Business fixed investment also was expected to provide substantial support to continued economic expansion, though some moderation in purchases of business equipment seemed likely after the exceptionally rapid rates of growth in such investments in recent years."
"Business contacts suggested that investment spending had been supported by the replacement and upgrading of existing capital, making up for some spending that had been postponed in the downturn, and this component of investment demand was seen as unlikely to remain robust."
"Conversely, if employment and inflation returned toward the Committee's objectives more slowly than currently anticipated, the date of liftoff for the federal funds rate could be later, and future federal funds rate target increases could be more gradual."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey rose a little in June and July, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey continued to be stable."
The unemployment rate moved down further and stood at 6.
The unemployment rate edged down to 7.
"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained."
"Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers held relatively steady in July, as in recent months."
"The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
"The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in April, with increases spread widely across most demographic groups."
"He viewed current disinflationary forces as likely to be transitory, and was reasonably confident that inflation would move toward 2 percent."
Reports from a number of participants indicated that single-family construction was strengthening and house prices were rising in most parts of their Districts.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
Some participants also questioned whether slowing the pace of purchases at a time when inflation was running well below the Committee's longer-run objective was appropriate.
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth regained some vigor in recent months after having slowed in late spring.
"Others emphasized that in the current situation, monetary policy could still play an important role in reducing unemployment."
"Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"The average pace of real GDP growth was expected to be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down very slowly over the projection period, and the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2012."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"But as suggested by the rise until recently in profit margins, businesses had been able to realize productivity gains that tended to offset the faster increases in compensation costs."
"In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
"A few participants expressed concerns about the possibility of substantially overshooting full employment, with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing."
"Whether greater labor cost pressures would emerge in the context of the members' consensus forecast for economic activity was a critical issue in the outlook for prices, though it was noted that at least some of the rising costs were likely to be absorbed in shrinking profit margins."
"The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In addition, increases in ownersÂ equivalent rent slowed noticeably, while rent inflation remained about the same as a year earlier."
"As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher, the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data were projected to continue."
"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time."
"In contrast, imports of petroleum products fell in May, held back by both lower prices and reduced volumes."
The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
"The legal requirement to set and announce such ranges recently had expired, and the members did not view the ranges as currently serving a useful role in the formulation of monetary policy."
"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 2000, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
"Opportunities to enhance profits by using new technology were likely to lead to robust further growth in business fixed investment, boosted mainly by spending for equipment and software over the year ahead."
Somewhat larger increases would have been projected in consumer price inflation in the absence of anticipated technical measurement changes to the index.
"Inflation remained low in most economies, partly as a result of earlier declines in oil prices."
"Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
"In addition, service industries continued to post very large employment gains."
"Consumer price inflation rose somewhat in the second quarter, but futures prices for energy and agricultural commodities generally were trending down over the next couple of years and longer-run measures of inflation expectations remained stable."
"But, compared with the November forecast, a number of other conditioning assumptions were less favorable: House prices and housing activity were likely to be lower, while interest rates, oil prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar were projected to be higher, on average, than previously assumed."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
The analysis indicated that the Federal Reserve was likely to earn substantial net interest income over the next few years under most interest rate scenarios.
"In these circumstances, a small preemptive move at this time would provide a degree of insurance against worsening inflation later."
The unemployment rate was 8.
"Advance estimates for September indicated a narrower merchandise trade deficit, with a rebound in exports and a decline in imports relative to August."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months."
"Indications that growth in aggregate demand was moderating to a pace closer to that of potential supply were still partial and tentative, and labor markets remained unusually tight."
The U. S. international trade deficit declined somewhat in May after reaching a record high in April.
"Further improvement in the labor market, a stabilization of energy prices, and a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar were all seen as helpful in establishing confidence that inflation would turn up."
The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
"A few participants observed that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, could lead to greater financial stability risks."
"Still, pressures on prices stemming from labor costs seemed well contained and were expected to remain damped in coming quarters."
"In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
"With significant underutilization of resources expected to persist for several years, the staff continued to project that core inflation would slow somewhat further over the next two years."
"In the agricultural sector, farm income was under downward pressure due to low crop prices, and contacts expressed concern about the effects of the possible renegotiation of trade agreements on exports."
"Moreover, recent adverse developments in Europe and tighter domestic financial conditions led the staff to revise down somewhat the medium-term forecast for real GDP growth."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
Price inflation has remained subdued.
"The Committee stated that the substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help promote moderate growth over time."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
"3 However, the staff left its forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of the year essentially unrevised because other indicators of economic activity appeared comparatively strong in relation to real GDP during the first half of the year."
"Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1."
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"Later in the period, however, investors' concerns eased substantially on the resolution of some of the near-term political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, increased expectations for additional policy stimulus in Europe and Japan, and U. S. data on employment and retail sales in June that exceeded market expectations."
The expansion of private nonfarm payroll employment in May was markedly below the average pace of job gains in the previous months of this year.
"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand."
"However, domestic demand in most of those economies remained relatively weak, and developments abroad were likely to provide little impetus to demand for U. S. exports in the near term."
"Broad stock price index increases over the intermeeting period were led by the energy, consumer discretionary, basic materials, and health-care sectors."
"With long-run inflation expectations stable and substantial slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued in 2012 and 2013."
"Growth of private domestic final demand had slowed from its pace in the first half of the year, though it was still relatively robust, and reduced spending on U. S. exports and rising import competition were exerting appreciable restraint on overall activity, as was a slowing in inventory investment."
"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization."
"Consumer prices in many foreign economies declined further in the first months of this year, reflecting the falls in energy prices as well as decreases in food prices in some emerging market economies."
"The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market."
"Indeed, in the absence of some policy firming most of the members saw tightening labor markets and an updrift in measured inflation as a significant risk."
Both the overall consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-linked index decelerated significantly over the past year.
"The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. """
"Members observed in this regard that some factors that had contributed to a currently subdued rate of inflation, notably the appreciation of the dollar, damped wage demands, and relatively limited increases in the cost of health benefits, were not likely to continue to exert the same restraining influence."
"Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and the continuing low readings on the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, together with a high incidence of workers being employed part time for economic reasons, were generally seen as indicating that overall labor market conditions remained weak."
"In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"Over the next several quarters, economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economy's trend rate of growth."
"In the housing sector, both demand and construction activity remained strong."
"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets, on balance, remained supportive of growth in household spending, although interest rates for consumer loans continued to rise."
"Although participants marked down their expectations for the rate of increase in real GDP over the first half of the year, their projections for economic growth in the second half of 2015 and over 2016 and 2017 were broadly similar to those prepared for the March meeting."
A few other participants suggested that the adoption of a range could convey a message that small deviations of inflation from 2 percent were unlikely to give rise to sizable policy responses.
"Moreover, still-tight credit standards meant that many households were unable to qualify for loans to buy a home, and the drop in house prices in recent years left others unable to refinance an existing higher-rate mortgage."
"Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative, although the growth of CRE loans on banks' books slowed somewhat."
"There were anecdotal reports of excess inventories of unsold homes in some areas, and members again cited indications of particular softness in the high-price segment of the housing market."
"AlÂ­though the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average."
"They agreed that the strong rebound in job gains in June--together with a rise in the labor force participation rate and a decline in the number of individuals who were working part time for economic reasons--suggested that, despite the very soft employment report for May, labor market conditions remained solid and slack had continued to diminish."
"Moreover, to the extent that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates, they potentially expose financial markets to a rapid rise in those rates in the future, which could impose significant losses on some investors and intermediaries."
"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened in January and February, reflecting a considerably larger expansion in the value of imports than in that of exports."
"Participants agreed that in coming quarters inflation was likely to move down to levels consistent with price stability, reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, the appreciation of the dollar, and the expected widening of margins of resource slack."
"Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance."
"Core prices had posted a string of very low increases last summer, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices."
"Accordingly, economic activity was expected to increase at its potential rate in 2009."
"Unemployment claims were exceptionally elevated, and the ratio of permanent job cuts to temporary layoffs was substantially higher than in previous economic downturns."
"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound."
"Still, it seemed most likely that, with modest further policy action, including a 25 basis point firming today, growth in activity would moderate gradually over coming quarters, pressures on resources would remain limited, and core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year."
Consumer sentiment had remained upbeat in the context of an extended period of sizable expansion in employment and incomes and the sharp rise in stock market prices over the course of recent years.
"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.
"Economic data releases were mixed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but market participants were especially attentive to incoming information on the labor market--most notably, the private payroll figures in the employment report for May, which were considerably weaker than investors expected."
"Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
Market participants' perceptions of an improved global economic outlook appeared to provide some support to prices of risk assets.
"However, waiting was an acceptable alternative given the favorable economic news and the persisting uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to prices."
"On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
A few participants suggested that it would be useful to evaluate the potential role of an ON RRP facility in the context of the Committee's plans for monetary policy implementation over the medium and longer term.
"In August, the U. S. international trade deficit narrowed, as exports edged up and imports declined, but it remained wider than it had been at its recent low point in May."
Private-sector demand for labor remained solid in November.
"Manufacturing, notably in high-tech industries, led the way, but growth in mining and utilities also was sizable."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
"Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth, though volatility in securities markets increased notably toward the end of the intermeeting period."
"Participants still projected that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels they saw as consistent with the Committee's dual mandate, but at a more gradual pace than they had forecast in April."
"In light of these developments, participants generally continued to expect that inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run as the effects of transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market and the overall economy improved further."
"The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
"Many of the members emphasized, however, that in such circumstances the Committee might need to act promptly to forestall a buildup of inflationary forces that could destabilize the expansion."
An unchanged monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent was set in January for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1996.
"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, members decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
It was noted that the System's reverse repurchase (RRP) agreement operations continued to provide a soft floor under short-term interest rates.
"While they continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, many participants attached significant odds to scenarios with less favorable outcomes."
"Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was little revised."
"Many participants noted that in the current low-interest rate environment, investors in some financial markets were taking on additional risk--either credit risk or interest rate risk--in an effort to boost returns."
"Total nominal retail sales surged in May after having changed little in April; the increase in sales, coupled with available information on prices, suggested that real consumer spending on goods had risen substantially on balance since the first quarter."
"While this relatively recent development was not yet conclusive evidence of accelerating labor costs, especially without further information about productivity, anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation also appeared to have multiplied."
A few participants referred to historical episodes when the unemployment rate appeared to have fallen well below its estimated longer-run normal level.
"Solid gains in employment and income, the relatively high ratio of household wealth to income, low gasoline prices, and a high level of consumer confidence were seen as factors that should contribute to moderate growth in consumer spending."
"That sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the August employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its ""soft patch. """
"Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were mixed in recent months, while market-based measures of inflation compensation declined from levels that were already low."
"In explaining that outlook, participants cited the lack of upward pressure from labor costs and prices of imported commodities as well as the stability of inflation expectations."
"Conditions in the labor market showed some continued improvement, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate and to bottom out in late 2020.
"Most members saw little risk that a modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures in the economy, given the subdued behavior of inflation and their outlook for economic activity."
Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad based across countries.
"The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would strengthen and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with its dual mandate."
"Many said they expected underlying inflation to stay, for some time, below levels they judged most consistent with the dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation."
The staff's medium-term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast.
"While expanding foreign demand for U. S. goods and services was a welcome development from the perspective of numerous business firms, such demand might add to pressures on U. S. resources with potentially inflationary implications, depending on the extent to which the growth in domestic demand would slow going forward."
"Considerable vigor in consumer spending late last year boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter, supported by further increases in employment and income."
"Through November, payroll employment had regained somewhat more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic."
"The current account deficit had narrowed significantly on balance in recent quarters, and still-solid foreign growth was expected to contribute to a further narrowing of the real U. S. trade deficit in coming quarters."
"In their remarks concerning the external sector of the economy, members cited the decline in the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets since the middle of last year and stronger economic growth in many of our trading partners as factors boosting the demand for exports in a variety of industries."
"Job growth was quite strong, however, and industrial production appeared to be picking up."
Housing starts increased appreciably in the January-February period as builders took advantage of good weather to try to catch up with backlogged demand.
Recent low monthly readings of PCE prices suggested that the 12-month change measure of PCE price inflation would likely continue to run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective for some time.
"Some participants noted that the level of the federal funds target, especially when compared with the current rate of inflation, was relatively low by historical standards."
"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
"The underlying trend in consumer price inflation had remained subdued, but the increase in average hourly earnings had continued to edge higher early this year."
Construction employment grew rapidly in November even after the outsized gains in October due to hurricane-related repair work.
"Although the appreciable upturn in those rates since midyear appeared to have slowed mortgage refinancing activity, at least in some areas, housing demand had remained buoyant perhaps in part because many homebuyers were attempting to lock in mortgage financing while rates were still low in relation to historical norms."
"With regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand."
"Given the current quite low level of short-term rates, especially when judged against the recent level of inflation, members noted that significant cumulative policy tightening likely would be needed to foster conditions consistent with the Committee's objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth."
"Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
Consumer food prices were little changed in August.
"Real PCE rebounded robustly in May, with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
The U. S. international trade deficit widened in June before narrowing substantially in July.
"In addition, the presentation discussed the possible use of term RRP operations, either before or after the commencement of policy firming, as a way to reinforce control of short-term interest rates and to manage the size of the ON RRP program."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, on balance, economic activity has grown moderately in recent months."
"Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"By contrast, the expansion of business fixed investment, notably in equipment and software, was projected to remain robust, and further solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the expansion of U. S. exports for some period ahead."
"They generally agreed that their confidence would increase if, as anticipated, economic activity continued to expand at a pace sufficient to increase resource utilization."
The dollar declined against the German mark and other European currencies as growing indications of a recent pickup in economic activity in Germany damped market expectations of any further easing of monetary policy by the Bundesbank.
"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Most regions continued to report strong housing markets, albeit with evidence of some weakening in sales of high-priced homes in a number of areas."
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes edged higher, on net, over the intermeeting period, and equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations increased."
"He recognized the case for holding policy steady given recent developments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he believed, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide valuable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain above a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later."
"Housing-sector activity continued to expand, likely supported by the effects of low interest rates."
"However, participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and inflation rates abroad generally continued to be quite low."
"Responses from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible, and that banks' lending standards were little changed in recent months."
"However, survey data indicated some backup in gasoline prices in July."
"House price appreciation had slowed further, with some measures showing outright declines in home values."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its average monthly level for the fourth quarter.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2."
"Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid-June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity."
Several participants noted that planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocksâwhich could have negative implications for the economyâor that lower bank capital ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP growth.
"In these circumstances, members generally saw some risk of rising inflation going forward, but they also recognized that similar forecasts in recent years had proved wrong and that considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of somewhat higher core inflation."
Participants' Discussion of Policy Planning Participants discussed considerations related to the choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases.
"Regarding the outlook for inflation, the additional sharp declines in energy prices and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar since the December meeting were likely to hold down inflation for longer than previously anticipated, but inflation was expected to increase gradually as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports stabilized and the labor market strengthened further."
"In the housing market, access to mortgage credit that was still restricted for some borrowers, constraints on buildable land in some regions, and rising interest rates were cited as having continued to restrain the recovery in housing."
"Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the downside, and a few participants commented that they expected inflation to run below 2 percent for some time."
"Indicators suggested that the demand for commercial properties had fallen off substantially from record levels last year, and commercial property prices appeared to be decelerating."
These participants generally judged that much of the softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the influence of these factors waned.
The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite the decline in U. S. interest rates.
"At the same time, despite some expected deceleration in imports as domestic demand moderated, the nation's trade deficit was projected to increase somewhat further over the year ahead."
"The current ranges approved in February for the period from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999, which were unchanged from those for the last several years, included growth of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3."
A sound banking system and low inflation were seen as sources of underlying strength in the economy that would contribute to the eventual pickup in economic activity.
"Rising energy prices pushed up total PCE price inflation in March, while the twelve-month increase in core PCE prices was just slightly above its year-earlier pace."
"For example, a couple of participants noted evidence suggesting that a shift in the relationship between the unemployment rate and the level of job vacancies in recent years was unlikely to persist as the economy recovered and unemployment benefits returned to customary levels."
"On balance, inflation was expected to remain near its current low level."
"To be sure, unit labor costs in the nonfinancial corporate sector had changed little over the past year, undoubtedly reflecting impressive further gains in productivity."
"A large decline in inventory investment was expected to reduce the pace of GDP growth in the third quarter, but participants saw further outsized declines in inventory accumulation as unlikely."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in September, but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months."
"However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U. S. economy in the period ahead."
"Amid a weakening outlook for economic growth in Europe, central banks in several emerging European economies began to decrease policy rates."
"In addition, some surveys of employers suggested a somewhat more upbeat outlook for employment."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth had slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on average in July and August from its rate in the second quarter.
"Some members saw a risk that growth in certain rapidly expanding regions abroad could slow, perhaps sharply, with potentially significant effects on the demand for U. S. exports as well as on global commodity prices."
"Primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the staff revised up its projection of real GDP growth for 2021 as a whole, as social-distancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed."
"Data on productivity and capital accumulation that had become available in recent months had tended to confirm these trends, and the statistical evidence was reinforced by comments from many business executives and by persistent upward revisions to long-term profit forecasts, which had yet to suggest a leveling out of productivity growth."
"On balance, core inflation was expected to continue at a subdued rate over the projection period."
"The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
"Industrial production decreased in September as the output of both the manufacturing and mining sectors declined, likely reflecting the effects of the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the fall in crude oil prices since the middle of last year."
"Most participants anticipated that, with stable inflation expectations, significant slack in labor and product markets, slow wage growth, and little evidence of pricing power among firms, inflation was likely to decline moderately over time."
"In their review of the recent data and the outlook for inflation, participants discussed a number of factors that could be contributing to the low readings on consumer prices this year and weighed the extent to which those factors might be transitory or could prove more persistent."
Several participants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a standing repurchase agreement facility as part of the framework for implementing monetary policy.
"Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, housing units, and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items."
Growth in consumer spending would likely continue to be supported by gains in employment and incomes.
"In all, the recent data indicated that net exports probably continued to be a moderate drag on real GDP growth in the first quarter."
Price inflation was still relatively subdued.
"In light of surprisingly low recent readings on inflation, participants expected that inflation on a 12-month basis would remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the incoming information suggested that the expansion had been considerably stronger in recent months than many had anticipated, while most measures of inflation had remained subdued."
"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that the slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seemed largely to have reflected temporary or special factors."
"For one, investors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen as likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line with potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative to saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U. S. growth."
"Although fiscal policy more generally would probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were likely to persist."
A few participants noted that current measures of labor market slack would be overstated if structural factors accounted for a large portion of the current high levels of unemployment.
"Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting, alÂ­though a number of downside risks remained prominent."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 26-27 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months.
"The ongoing cooling in the housing market would act to restrain residential construction and growth in consumption, but business and household confidence and supportive financial conditions would help to foster growth in employment and incomes, keeping consumption and investment on a solid upward track."
"In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"With crude oil prices expected to continue to decrease slowly, the boost to retail food prices from last summer's drought anticipated to be only temporary and fairly small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and considerable resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff projected that inflation would be subdued through 2015."
"In their comments about regional economic developments, the members reported generally favorable business conditions and further growth in all regions, with variations ranging from some acceleration in a number of Federal Reserve Districts to modest deceleration in some others."
"In October, the producer price index for core intermediate materials moved up only slightly for a second month, and the twelve-month increase in these prices was considerably below that of the year-earlier period."
The U. S. international trade deficit widened in February.
"8 percent in February, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on balance."
"The output of high-tech equipment rose at a moderate rate in the first half of the year, but indicators of production gains in the high-tech sector pointed toward relatively subdued growth in the third quarter."
At this meeting the Committee reviewed and discussed staff presentations on the topic of housing valuations and monetary policy.
"With that goal in mind, participants discussed a range of additional steps that the Committee might take to help the public better understand the linkages between the evolving economic outlook and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, and thus the conditionality in the Committee's forward guidance."
"The inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings on inflation that were, on balance, higher than expected."
Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
The recent statistical and anecdotal information was more mixed than had been the case earlier and pointed on balance toward some moderation in the decline of overall final demand; for the first time in a long while the incoming data did not call for a downward revision to current forecasts.
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
"With real GDP likely to expand below its potential over coming quarters, recent price trends favorable, and inflation expectations appearing reasonably well anchored, the easing of policy at this meeting seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation."
"In these circumstances, a pause seemed desirable to monitor the still-incomplete effects of the Committee's easing over the past year--a significant part of which had been implemented in recent months--and the contours of the turnaround in economic activity."
"Consequently, total PCE price inflation was projected to run a little above core inflation this year and then edge down to the same rate as core inflation in 2011."
"Accommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sensitive expenditure categories, including residential investment and consumer durables spending."
"Still, the rise in the price index for personal consumption expenditures over the twelve months ending in December was estimated to have been noticeably less than that of the year-earlier period."
"Foreign equity indexes, which generally rose following the September FOMC statement, ended the intermeeting period higher in most markets, although stock prices in the euro area were down on net."
"However, some participants indicated that underlying inflation remained subdued; that longer-term inflation expectations were likely to remain anchored, partly because modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends; and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery."
"Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates and largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably over the intermeeting period."
"Yields on short-term nominal Treasury coupon securities declined over the intermeeting period, reportedly as a result of substantial flight-to-quality flows and heightened demand for liquidity."
"In light of these considerations, several participants assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity, and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revision of the outlook for economic activity."
A surge in nonfarm payroll employment in February considerably more than offset a large weather-related drop in January.
"Participants expected some fluctuations in consumer spending to result from the hurricanes, but they generally judged that consumption growth would continue to be supported by still-solid fundamental determinants of household spending, including the income generated by the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer confidence."
"Nominal yields on longer-term U. S. Treasury securities rose substantially over the period, reflecting both higher real yields and an increase in inflation compensation."
"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent at this meeting."
The Committee decided to note that the declines in energy and commodity prices from their recent peaks had led to a moderation of inflation and that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.
The staff's forecast for inflation was quite similar to the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
The longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and under some scenarios less promising.
"A few participants, however, highlighted factors other than weather that had likely contributed to the slowdown during the first quarter, including slower growth in net exports following its unusually large positive contribution to growth in the fourth quarter of 2013."
House prices appeared to be stabilizing but had not yet begun to rise in most markets.
Private nonfarm payroll employment edged up in April and May after a slowdown in the first quarter in the pace of layoffs and job separations.
A few participants noted that the adoption by the Committee of an explicit numerical inflation objective could help keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
"Moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations."
"Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor market conditions in recent months, and the unemployment rate has moved up."
The staff continued to forecast that inflation would run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective early this year but above the low level observed over much of 2013.
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in early 2004.
"In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members referred to the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation and to indications of escalating increases in labor compensation in a number of areas."
"The rate of private-sector job openings continued to be elevated in June and July, while the rate of quits moved higher on balance; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were at a historically low level in mid-September."
"Other positive factors cited as helping to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions in federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero interest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes."
The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.
Such a pause also would better allow the Committee time to assess the degree to which earlier soft readings on inflation were transitory or more persistent.
"Most interest rates have declined on balance since the day before the Committee meeting on December 16, 1997."
"To this end, almost all members agreed on a specification for outcome-based forward guidance that indicated that the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 percent for some time."
Members agreed that the statement should continue to convey that inflation risks remained of greatest concern and that additional policy firming was possible.
"Tending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use of an extended period of economic activity below the economyâs potential as well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently declining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets."
"Although monthly statistical releases could be quite volatile, the recent data showing consumer inflation a little above previous expectations were of concern."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
"The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending."
The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
Participants generally agreed it would be important to monitor inflation developments closely.
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the Committee members reached the collective judgment that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
The Committee also stated that it will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
"Participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the flattening of the yield curve, including the expected gradual rise of the federal funds rate, the downward pressure on term premiums from the Federal Reserve's still-large balance sheet as well as asset purchase programs by other central banks, and a reduction in investors' estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate."
"Broad U. S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, extending their recent strong performance; bank stock prices modestly outperformed the broader market."
The pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady.
"Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
"Even with demand growth slower, labor markets were likely to remain unusually tight for some time, and in such circumstances labor costs could begin to rise increasingly in excess of even elevated gains in productivity."
"To date, unit labor costs were not placing pressure on inflation, and high profit margins left firms a considerable buffer to absorb cost increases."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2014 and over the longer run."
"Export growth was driven by higher exports of capital goods and consumer goods, while the import decline was led by lower imports of industrial supplies and capital goods."
"Moreover, meeting participants noted that the volume of credit extended to households and businesses was still contracting as a result of shrinking demand, declining credit quality, capital constraints on financial institutions, and the limited availability of financing through securitization markets."
All could agree that the risks of further disinflation were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.
"Although a complete accounting for the moderation in growth was not possible, the Committee agreed that a resumption of faster growth in consumer spending was very likely."
"Prices of all finished goods jumped in June and were unchanged in July, and core producer prices were unchanged on balance in the June-July period."
The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
The staff also described the Federal Reserve's experience in implementing monetary policy during the recent financial crisis.
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
"Several participants judged that the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities as well as lower long-term interest rates would likely provide an offset to the higher dollar and weaker foreign growth, or that the domestic recovery remained on a firm footing."
"However, respondents noted greater demand for funding of agency and non-agency residential MBS."
More-recent indicators suggest that economic activity in China has slowed some.
"Readings on core inflation had been elevated in recent months, but ongoing productivity gains had held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remained contained."
A few participants suggested that a modest inflation overshoot might help push up longer-term inflation expectations and anchor them at a level consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.
"Most participants expected that continuing reductions in resource slack would be helpful in returning inflation over the medium term to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, but a few participants voiced concern that nominal wage growth might rise rapidly and inflation might exceed 2 percent for a time."
They cited a variety of statistical and anecdotal signs that could be viewed as harbingers of rising price inflation.
"In addition, there had been no evidence of any erosion in the widespread expectation that inflation would remain subdued over the long run."
"In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), recent data suggested that economic activity, especially in the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first quarter of this year."
"Consumer energy prices rose appreciably in October, but they were still down sharply from a year earlier and on balance limited the increase of overall consumer prices over the past year."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
The anticipated further expansion of aggregate demand should boost investment.
"However, a further deterioration in financial conditions could not be ruled out and, to the extent such a development could have an adverse effect on growth prospects, might require a policy response."
"Reflecting these strains, interest rates on residential mortgages had moved upward, a development that was seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"The average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held steady in May, although it was still elevated."
The staff's forecast for inflation was basically unchanged from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
In a number of cases they already had seen a substantial downturn in their exports or a surge in competing imports at prices they found difficult to match.
"In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective."
"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment."
"On the one hand, the revised data might indicate that households have made greater progress in repairing their balance sheets than had been realized, potentially allowing stronger growth in consumer spending as the recovery proceeds."
"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
The staff continued to project that inflation would reach the Committee's 2 percent objective in 2019.
"Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
Weakness in demand deposits after unusually rapid first-quarter expansion and sluggishness in currency demand were factors in the slowdown.
"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains."
"Most participants still expected that if economic growth remained moderate, labor markets would continue to tighten gradually, with the unemployment rate running only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate."
"In the near term, most participants anticipated that substantial slack in both labor and product markets would likely keep inflation subdued."
"Moreover, it was noted that the longer-run downward trend in real interest rates suggested that short-run r* would likely remain below levels that were normal during previous business cycle expansions, and that the longer-run normal level to which the nominal federal funds rate might be expected to converge in the absence of further shocks to the economy--that is, the level that would be consistent, in the long run, with maximum employment and 2 percent inflation--would likely be lower than was the case in previous decades."
"The change in net exports was a significant drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, as imports grew rapidly."
"With crude oil prices anticipated to trend down slowly from their current levels, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015."
"At the same time, longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
"Several participants reported moderate growth in services industries, but a couple noted some slowing of activity."
Raising the ranges for M2 and M3 would in their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in the Federal Reserve Act that require the System to communicate to the Congress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for the calendar year.
Private nonfarm payroll employment fell in both June and July.
"Price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, in large part as a result of some upturn in import prices and a slight firming of gains in nominal labor compensation that would not be fully offset by rising productivity."
It was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed.
The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.
"With some limited remaining slack in labor markets likely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of policy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained."
Equity prices were also boosted by better-than-anticipated corporate earnings and retail-sector data.
"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain."
The apparent pickup in real PCE growth was consistent with recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending.
"While participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions."
The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1998.
"On balance, participants thought that there would likely be a significant shift in the timing of aggregate economic activity over the next several quarters but probably little effect on the economy's intermediate-term growth prospects."
Participants agreed that underlying inflation currently was subdued and was likely to remain so for some time.
"During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants indicated that they did not see the changes in asset prices during the intermeeting period as bearing significantly on their policy choice except insofar as they affected the outlook for achieving the Committee's macroeconomic objectives and the risks associated with that outlook."
"In South America, economic and financial conditions had deteriorated significantly during the intermeeting period, especially in Brazil and Uruguay, and economic activity remained particularly weak in Argentina and Venezuela."
The deceleration in labor compensation may have been induced in large measure by the low level of consumer price inflation in 1998.
"Five-year inflation compensation increased over the intermeeting period, and forward inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead also rose."
"The recent sharp slowing in motor vehicle sales, which appeared to be related in part to the paring of purchase incentives and perhaps also to the high level of energy prices, raised some concerns about the expansion of economic activity in some regions."
China's monetary authority further increased banks' lending rates and deposit rates and continued to tighten reserve requirements; monetary policy in a number of other EMEs was also tightened over the intermeeting period.
A couple of participants offered views on the role of financial stability in monetary policy decisionmaking more broadly.
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
"Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July and August."
"Nevertheless, the increased prices of energy and other commodities and the possibility of a further rise in resource utilization, which some members viewed as nearly full at present, represented continuing risks, potentially adding to inflation pressures."
The Committee indicated that it would continue to monitor economic and financial developments and act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
"In July, households' expectations for consumer inflation in the year ahead fell somewhat."
"At the same time, incoming inflation data had been benign, indicating relatively modest pass-through of higher energy prices to core inflation to date; subdued gains in compensation and strong growth in productivity were holding down business costs; and inflation expectations, which had jumped after the hurricanes, had fallen back."
"In addition, the Bank of Mexico continued to ease monetary policy, citing concerns about the strength of the economy, but central banks in certain other emerging market economies, including Brazil and India, tightened policy and intervened in currency markets in response to concerns about the potential effect of currency depreciation on inflation."
"Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to drop, likely reflecting weak demand and a continued tightening of credit terms by banks."
"The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages moved up in line with Treasury yields, although the rate remained low by historical standards and mortgage availability appeared little changed."
"Consumer spending had rebounded from its summer lull, but housing demand was somewhat weaker on balance and the growth of business spending on durable equipment had slowed from a very rapid pace."
"Household expenditures on new homes were likewise at an elevated level, although members reported weakness in some price segments and geographic areas of the housing market."
"The solid further expansion expected in many foreign economies, the slower growth of domestic demand in the United States, and the effects of the slippage of the foreign exchange value of the dollar on the relative prices of U. S. goods and services were all seen as contributing to this outcome."
"In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth quarter."
"Moreover, the recovery remained subject to some downside risks, such as the possibility of a more extended period of weak activity and lower prices in the housing sector and potential financial and economic spillovers if the banking and sovereign debt problems in Europe were to worsen."
"Overall U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased at a modest rate in December and January."
"Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p. m. : ""The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
Part of the decline likely also reflected an increase in safe-haven demands for low-risk and highly liquid assets amid the turbulence in financial markets.
"However, other important near-term indicators of economic activity remained downbeat: Measures of consumer sentiment were still very low, business surveys pointed to continued caution by firms, conditions in the labor market remained weak, and gains in manufacturing production outside of the motor vehicle--related sectors were sluggish."
"In the circumstances, the risks to the economy appeared to be strongly tilted toward rising inflation whose emergence would in turn threaten the sustainability of the expansion."
"With the drag from fiscal policy anticipated to increase next year, the staff projected that the growth rate of real GDP would not materially exceed that of potential output until 2014 when economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment."
Participants discussed the implications of the further decline in the prices of oil and other commodities and the additional appreciation of the dollar since the previous FOMC meeting for the outlook for inflation.
"In this view, while there were uncertainties, the weight of the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to contain inflation and set the stage for further progress toward price stability."
"The strength of M2 and also that of M3 was related at least in part to changes in the allocation of financial assets and liabilities rather than to the growth in spending; in particular, the volatility in the stock market evidently fostered a redirection of funds to M2 assets, among others, and included heavy inflows to the money market funds component of M2."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U. S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 through 2019 was little changed from the one presented in July."
"This weakness was attributed to a variety of factors, including increased mortgage rates and rising home prices."
Participants agreed that any Committee decision regarding the trend pace of balance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of reserve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implementation should be clearly distinguished from past large-scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommodation and ease overall financial conditions.
"Against that backdrop, it was noteworthy that many private-sector forecasters predicted a pronounced upturn in economic growth in the third quarter."
"She believed that monetary policy should respond to these developments by gradually removing accommodation, consistent with the prescriptions of several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
"Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses."
"Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities also fell, apparently responding at least in part to the decline in commodity prices."
"Reports from business contacts suggested less price discounting, but pricing power remained limited."
An unexpectedly strong rebound in economic growth could begin to put added upward pressure on prices at a time when labor markets were still tight by historical standards and accelerating productivity no longer held down increases in unit labor costs.
Market expectations for the path of monetary policy moved down sharply.
"In their view, such an action was desirable to cushion the likely adverse consequences on future domestic economic activity of the global financial turmoil that had weakened foreign economies and of the tighter conditions in financial markets in the United States that had resulted in part from that turmoil."
Lender caution and less receptive markets probably had contributed to considerable weakening recently in overall growth of credit to nonfinancial businesses.
"Inflation had been subdued in recent months, there was little evidence of wage or cost pressures, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
"The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost."
"Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth."
"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed considerably in the fourth quarter.
"However, a few other participants pointed to increasing job gains in recent months as contributing to an improving trend in real incomes and thus supporting continued moderate growth in consumer spending."
"U. S. real GDP was forecast to show a historically large decline in the second quarter of this year, and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter."
"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future."
"Longer-term inflation expectations also edged down, but stayed a touch above the narrow range observed in recent years."
"Equity prices of financial institutions increased, reportedly as investors interpreted the first-quarter earnings of several large banking organizations and the results of the CCAR as better than expected."
"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
The staff projected that inflation would be very close to the Committee's 2 percent objective in 2019 and at that objective in 2020.
"Consequently, labor markets were expected to continue to firm and the unemployment rate to decline gradually."
"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal."
"The upward pressure on consumer prices from increases in import and commodity prices earlier in the year, along with the temporary boost to motor vehicle prices from low inventories, were expected to recede further in the coming quarters."
These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent for both years.
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
"The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
"The rise, which was most pronounced against the Japanese yen and continental European currencies, appeared to reflect market perceptions of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the United States and a risk of faltering growth in the other countries."
"Others did not disagree that the odds might be tilted marginally in that direction, but they continued to believe that a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for resource use and, in turn, the relationship between a given degree of pressure on resources and overall price changes."
"However, contacts in several Districts indicated that export demand had weakened as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe; Asia; and some emerging market countries, including China."
Business capital spending appeared to be continuing to decline at a rapid pace as business firms persisted in their efforts to bring production capacity into better alignment with forecasts for the growth of sales.
"Indeed, the considerable decelerations in wages and unit labor costs this year were cited as factors putting downward pressure on inflation."
Relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures.
Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021.
"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon."
Participants agreed that the housing sector was apt to remain a drag on growth for some time and represented a significant downside risk to the economic outlook.
"In addition, other indicators of labor demand, such as measures of hiring and job vacancies, did not improve."
"These members noted that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"An estimate of the expected real return on equities moved down, reflecting an increase in stock prices and downward revisions to forecasts of corporate earnings, and corporate bond spreads declined somewhat."
The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020.
It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
"Against this backdrop, many participants expressed the view that, especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures, the Committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming."
"Equity prices rose in most of the advanced foreign economies, with euro-area stocks rallying both before and after the early March commencement of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB under its PSPP."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the March 13 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately.
"The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance fell back a little, but the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance benefits continued to increase."
"Meanwhile, increases in energy prices pushed up headline consumer price inflation even as core consumer price inflation remained subdued."
"Some pointed out, however, that the fiscal stimulus package might not help in the near term, when the risks of a downturn in economic activity appeared largest."
Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.
"A few mentioned that a pickup in wage increases could bolster their confidence that resource utilization had tightened sufficiently to help move inflation toward the Committee's objective, but they did not view an acceleration in wages as a necessary condition for gaining such confidence."
"In the advance release of the national income and product accounts, the BEA estimated that net exports subtracted substantially from real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter."
Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter.
"Thus, the members saw no reason to depart from the tentative range for nonfinancial debt, which was expected to readily encompass the likely rate of growth in this aggregate."
"A few participants pointed out the relative strength in construction of and demand for multifamily units, which possibly was due to a shift in demand among younger homebuyers away from single-family homes."
One participant observed that some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth could be due to difficulties in hiring rather than indicating weakness in demand.
"Meanwhile, employment at state and local governments declined further, reflecting their tight budget conditions."
"As a result, although the staff projection showed a higher level of real GDP, the average pace of growth over 2011 and 2012 was little changed from the November forecast, and the unemployment rate was still projected to decline slowly."
Several participants noted a pickup in market-based measures of inflation compensation.
"Even so, the members anticipated that labor markets would remain exceptionally tight, and with labor compensation already accelerating and higher energy prices potentially raising inflation expectations, they agreed that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation."
"With regard to labor costs, growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers declined significantly over the twelve months ended in September, evidently reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation."
"Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down considerably their expectations for the path of monetary policy."
"The very recent behavior of equity prices was difficult to explain satisfactorily, and potential movements in those prices posed risks on both sides of the most likely forecast: A future substantial increase would bolster wealth and spending, but a sharp decline also could not be ruled out--especially if, as seemed quite possible, added increases in prices were not supported by robust increases in profits."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Continued concerns about the global economic growth outlook weighed on market sentiment in the United States and abroad early in the intermeeting period, but sentiment improved somewhat in the weeks preceding the October FOMC meeting."
"The average workweek and aggregate hours declined in September, and weekly unemployment insurance claims continued to rise in October."
Auto loan interest rates dropped sharply in early April as manufacturers introduced attractive financing programs to boost sales.
"The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2016 and 2017, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending, even as the normalization of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
"The labor force participation rate declined a little in March after having risen, on balance, in the previous few months, and the employment-to-population ratio edged down."
"While the growth of consumer spending slowed in the second quarter from its rapid pace in prior quarters, wages and salaries increased solidly and household sentiment appeared supportive of further gains in spending."
Participants discussed readings from various market- and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations.
"Equity prices for large domestic banks rose about in line with the broad equity price indexes, and credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the largest bank holding companies continued to move down."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as little changed since the previous meeting, and, consequently, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
"In their discussion of financial developments, participants observed that financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as equity prices declined, longer-term yields and borrowing costs for most sectors increased, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose."
"Financial markets had become somewhat less supportive of economic growth since the April meeting, with the developments in Europe cited as a leading cause of greater global financial market tensions."
"At the same time, a couple of participants pointed out that the appreciation of the dollar might also tend to slow the gradual increase in inflation toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal."
"Even so, further increases in household incomes along with the lagged wealth effects of the sharp earlier advances in stock market prices seemed likely to sustain relatively strong consumer spending for some period of time."
"Manufacturing recorded additional widespread job losses in May, and there were signs that weakness in employment was spreading to related sectors, notably wholesale trade and help-supply services."
The ratio of business debt to nominal GDP rose in the first quarter from levels that were already historically highâamid declining profits and deteriorating credit qualityâalthough low interest rates had helped ease firms' debt servicing burdens.
Available indicators pointed to more moderate growth in business fixed investment after the surge in capital spending during the first half of the year.
"Many of these participants worried that, should the economy continue to operate below potential for too long, reduced investment and underutilization of labor could further undermine the growth of potential output over time."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
"For the second quarter as a whole, core inflation picked up from the pace in the first quarter, which had been revised down because of smaller increases in the imputed prices of nonmarket services."
"However, it was noted that the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could become a significant restraining factor for household spending."
"Several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risk-taking associated with a lengthy period of low long-term interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the Committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longer-term rates."
"The median of longer-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey edged down a bit, on balance, in recent months, while the medians from the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed."
"The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity."
"Communications from FOMC participants that were more accommodative than expected amid muted readings on inflation, communications from other major central banks that, on balance, were also regarded as more accommodative than expected, and generally mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sentiment."
"The core PCE price index was flat in July but, like the core CPI, was up a bit on balance over June and July."
"Broad equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting in part investors' perceptions of increased odds for the passage of federal tax legislation and an associated potential boost to corporate earnings."
"Exports increased in both months, with strong growth in July driven by higher agricultural exports."
"The staff's forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was slightly higher, on balance, largely reflecting the effects of the staff's provisional assumption that fiscal policy would be more expansionary in the coming years."
"Job growth in the services industry was brisk, construction hiring rose somewhat further against a backdrop of good weather and project backlogs, and manufacturing employment was essentially unchanged."
"Even so, the economy was seen as retaining considerable momentum, and growth was expected to pick up some after the first quarter, paced by business spending on equipment and software."
"Since the previous report in July, financial markets around the globe experienced a surge in volatility that peaked in late August amid concerns regarding slowing economic growth in emerging market economies and potential implications for advanced economies."
The growth in payroll employment during March pushed the average monthly gain for the first quarter as a whole well above that of the fourth quarter of last year.
"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed after surging in late 1996 and earlier this year."
Another major source of uncertainty was the prospective performance of productivity.
"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation."
"Taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the medium-term outlook for domestic demand was not appreciably different than it had been when the Committee met in December."
"The average workweek during the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter, and as a result aggregate hours decelerated despite the pickup in employment growth."
"Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, especially in China and some other emerging market economies."
"While the fall in energy prices was generally regarded as a positive development for many businesses, it was noted that a sustained drop in prices would have effects on oil drilling and related investment activity."
"Commercial and industrial loans on banks' balance sheets continued to increase at a robust pace, consistent with reports in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) of easier lending standards and terms as well as stronger loan demand from firms of all sizes."
"Broad stock price indexes fluctuated substantially, largely in reaction to news about the pandemic and economic activity, and ended the intermeeting period roughly unchanged."
Available indicators suggest that growth of business capital spending has remained relatively rapid.
"There were few signs thus far that the rise in interest rates over recent quarters was restraining demand in line with potential supply, and the members generally agreed that further tightening actions might well be needed to ensure that financial conditions had adjusted sufficiently to rising productivity growth to forestall escalating pressures on labor costs and prices."
"Overall, growth in emerging Asia moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its double-digit pace in the second quarter, but remained strong."
Staff Economic Outlook The data received since the staff prepared its forecast for the June FOMC meeting suggested that real GDP growth was even weaker in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.
"As had been true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar economic conditions."
"Moreover, the persistence of accommodative financial conditions, as evidenced by the ample availability of financing on favorable terms to business and household borrowers and by robust monetary growth, might well continue to support relatively strong domestic spending."
"Most participants expected inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years, supported by stable inflation expectations and the continued gradual recovery in economic activity."
"The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. """
"These participants' concerns were sharpened by the apparently weak responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization and the low level of the neutral interest rate, and such considerations suggested that the removal of policy accommodation should be quite gradual."
The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
"Declining oil prices had a smaller effect on inflation in the emerging market economies, reflecting the greater prevalence of administered energy prices."
"7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2."
"These participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent."
"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
"While most short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the period, yields on longer-term Treasury securities, and to a lesser extent on private debt instruments, declined somewhat, at least partly reflecting a further flight to safety and quality from renewed turbulence in a number of foreign markets."
"To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2."
"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"With regard to the outlook, the recent rise in mortgage interest rates could be expected to have a retarding effect on housing activity."
The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"A number of members noted that if the recent modest rate of economic growth were to persist, the economy would be less able to weather a material adverse shock without slipping back into recession."
"Nonetheless, the staff continued to project that the pace of economic activity would pick up gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further increases in credit availability, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment."
"Several participants commented that increases in the prices of particular goods, such as those induced by the tariff increases, would likely be one source of short-term upward pressure on the inflation rate, although offsetting influences--including the negative effects that trade developments were having on agricultural prices--were also noted."
"With inflation generally running below the target rates in these economies, monetary policies remained very accommodative."
A factor that seemed to be exerting an increasingly depressing effect on consumer attitudes was the persisting stream of worker layoffs and rising unemployment.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated."
"Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, and short-term funding markets were generally stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"Significant increases in energy and other commodity prices had boosted overall inflation, but members expected this increase to be transitory and to unwind when commodity price increases abated."
"Among the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic economic activity, the members viewed the external sector as a major source of uncertainty."
"Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in December."
"Although almost all still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from energy and commodity prices would be transitory, many viewed the persistent weakness in those prices as adding uncertainty or posing important downside risks to the inflation outlook."
"Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting the pass-through of earlier increases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices."
"Some indicators, including share prices and CDS spreads of financial institutions, suggested a worsening of financial market strains since January."
"It was noted that homebuilders were generally optimistic about the prospects for the year ahead, given their current backlogs and expectations of further growth in employment and incomes."
The forecast for core PCE price inflation over the first half of 2008 was raised in response to elevated readings in recent months.
"Such a forecast was subject to considerable uncertainty, and several members observed that the risks appeared to be mostly in the direction of stronger growth in demand."
"Finally, one participant expressed the view that prolonged periods of low interest rates could encourage pension funds, endowments, and investors with fixed future payout obligations to save more, depressing economic growth and adding to downward pressure on the neutral real interest rate."
"In Mr. Lacker's view, the outlook for economic growth had clearly weakened of late, but he questioned whether the maturity extension program would have much effect in current circumstances."
"Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and persisting slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the December meeting."
A few commented that home sales and prices appeared to be edging up in their Districts.
"Indeed, some policymakers noted that domestic demand in several major U. S. trading partners was relatively weak and that aggregate demand in those economies was being sustained importantly by exports to the United States."
"However, most participants, while recognizing the likely positive effects of recent policy actions abroad, saw foreign economic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace than previously expected, a development that probably would further restrain growth in U. S. exports and tend to damp overall aggregate demand."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
"In the United Kingdom, although real GDP grew solidly in the fourth quarter, the estimate of third-quarter real GDP growth was revised down."
"It was noted that while the recent economic data were mixed, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appeared to owe significantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties."
"The most recent employment cost index, released in April, had suggested an increase in wage gains."
"The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. """
The consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI both rose 2.
"Imports rose sharply, more than offsetting continued robust growth of exports."
"In addition, participants still saw significant downside risks to the outlook for economic growth."
Household mortgage borrowing was thought to have slowed somewhat in the first quarter in response to increased mortgage interest rates.
"Looking beyond the nearer term, current forecasts suggested that moderating growth in overall economic activity would tend to limit pressures on resources and foster relatively subdued price inflation in the context of robust productivity growth and ample industrial capacity."
Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information reviewed at the November 3-4 meeting suggested that overall economic activity continued to rise in recent months.
"In their comments about inflation, participants noted that increases in consumer prices had been soft of late, as prices of products in those categories most affected by social distancingâsuch as hotel accommodations and air travelâcontinued to be depressed and increases in rents remained low."
"Over the twelve-month period ending in June, the increase in core consumer prices as measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index was notably lower than the rise of the previous year."
"Recently, some of the available surveys had reported softer longer-run inflation expectations, while others suggested still-stable expectations."
"In their discussion of monetary policy going forward, participants focused primarily on possible changes to the Committee's forward guidance for the federal funds rate."
"Reports from business contacts predominantly pointed to continued strong labor demand, with firms offering both higher wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers."
Many expressed the view that the risks to the global economy that emerged late this summer had receded and anticipated moderate improvement in economic growth abroad in the coming year as currency and commodity markets stabilized.
"In their discussion of the economic outlook, the meeting participants regarded incoming data since the last meeting as supporting their expectations that, with the further removal of monetary accommodation, GDP would likely grow at a moderate pace consistent with a gradual reduction of remaining economic slack, and inflation would probably continue to be low."
"Despite the gains in spending and production, however, employment growth had been disappointing."
"Short-run r* was estimated to have recovered only partially and to be close to zero currently, still well below levels that prevailed during recent economic expansions when the unemployment rate was close to estimates of its longer-run normal level."
"To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 percent, effective December 17, 2015."
"Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"The members contemplated, however, that the stance of monetary policy would have to become less accommodative once clearer evidence emerged that a healthy expansion was firmly established."
"Except for oil, most sensitive commodity prices have risen only slightly after years of decline, the dollar remains strong, real short-term interest rates are near historical norms, and productivity growth has accelerated in recent quarters."
"In light of recent softer inflation readings, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and global disinflationary pressures, many participants viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as weighted to the downside."
"Even so, favorable prospects for employment and incomes and the large gains that had occurred in financial wealth suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over the projection horizon."
"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities moved up over the intermeeting period, but yields on nominal Treasury issues rose more."
"The rise in share prices likely reflected the improvement in the economic outlook and strong third-quarter earnings, which led analysts to mark up their estimates of future earnings."
"In view of the likely time frames for normalization of the stance of monetary policy and the System's balance sheet, the Committee probably would not need to reach any final decisions regarding such a framework for several years."
The Committee also expected that inflation would remain near its recent low level in the near term but rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate.
Home prices increased in May for the fifth consecutive month.
"Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had declined through the last week of May from their peak in late March, but they still were at a historically elevated level."
"Core consumer price inflation picked up, reflecting in part the pass-through of substantial advances in energy prices and non-energy import prices."
"One member, while acknowledging the downside risks to the expansion associated with potential developments in Asia, still was persuaded that the economy probably would continue to expand at an unsustainable pace and that monetary policy should be tightened promptly to avert a further buildup of pressures in already strained labor markets, associated increases in labor costs, and at some point an inevitable rise in price inflation."
"He continued to view asset purchases as unlikely to add to economic growth without unacceptably increasing the risk of future inflation, and to see purchases of MBS as inappropriate credit allocation."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
The unemployment rate was 6.
A number of participants suggested that the damping effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar on net exports or of the earlier decline in oil prices on firms' investment spending might be larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated.
"Given the prospects for an initially modest economic recovery, substantial resource slack, and subdued inflation, the Committee agreed that it should maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent."
"In China, the most recent evidence suggested that growth had remained strong."
"On the down-side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U. S. economic growth."
"Conditions in the labor market deteriorated noticeably, with private payroll employment posting a small decline in December and the unemployment rate rising."
"Labor market conditions improved further in September, although the pace of gains eased and employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"In several key advanced foreign economies, including the euro area, recent indicators pointed to slowing economic growth amid continued weakness in manufacturing and persistent policy-related uncertainty."
The virus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
"Indeed, with solid growth in productivity, unit labor costs had been well contained."
"For 1998 as a whole, CPI inflation was slightly lower than in 1997; a substantial decline in energy prices more than offset a sizable pickup in food inflation and a small increase in core inflation."
"Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stocks-sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some industries that were being adversely affected by the nation's growing trade deficit."
Participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of lowering the unemployment rate threshold provided in the forward guidance.
"Although many continued to see some downside risks arising from economic and financial developments abroad, participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for domestic economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced."
Economic growth appeared to hold up better in several emerging Asian economies.
"The somewhat better-than-expected crop harvest caused spot and futures prices of farm commodities to retrace some of their rise during the summer; however, farm commodity prices remained elevated and continued to point toward some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year."
"However, in the days following the release of the May employment report, which was read as being significantly less negative than anticipated, market participants marked up their expected path for the federal funds rate."
"Many judged that slack remained elevated, and a number of them thought it was greater than measured by the official unemployment rate, citing, in particular, the still-high level of workers employed part time for economic reasons or the depressed labor force participation rate."
"Longer-term interest rates began to back up after the announcement of the Committee's decision, as market participants had placed substantial odds on a larger policy move and, perhaps, even the release of details on potential unconventional policy actions."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"Pointing to academic and Federal Reserve staff research, most participants saw asset purchases as having a meaningful effect in easing financial conditions and so supporting economic growth."
"Financial conditions appeared to have changed little, on net, in recent months: Equity prices had risen and credit spreads had narrowed, but longer-term interest rates had increased and the dollar had appreciated further."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases."
"However, the turbulence abroad and, to a lesser degree, mounting concerns about trade policy weighed on equity prices at times."
"Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
Data from the consumer and producer price indexes for June suggested that both total and core PCE price inflation (on a 12-month change basis) remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month.
"A few members, however, were concerned that a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could necessitate a steep subsequent rise in policy rates, undermining the Committee's prior communications about its expectations for a gradually rising policy rate or even posing risks to the economic expansion."
"With respect to the outlook for overall consumer spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded."
Some members emphasized that the outlook for inflation was clouded by a high degree of uncertainty about the underlying trend in productivity.
"While real net exports made a large negative contribution to the change in real GDP in the first quarter of 2015, the available trade data indicated that the drag on GDP growth exerted by net exports in the second quarter was considerably smaller."
"By contrast, business fixed investment--notably, outlays for equipment and software--was projected to remain relatively robust, and brisk growth abroad would undergird the expansion of U. S. exports."
"Other factors important to the inflation outlook were the expectation that the influence of lower energy and commodities prices and the stronger dollar would subside, and that longer-term inflation expectations would remain stable."
"Payroll employment increased at a modest pace, and, although the data had been somewhat erratic, a slight downward trend was apparent in the recent pattern of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance."
"However, many participants expressed the view that cautious business sentiment, together with low industrial utilization rates, was likely to keep new capital spending subdued until firms became more confident about the durability of increases in demand."
"Longer-run inflation expectations were stable, but core inflation continued to trend lower."
"Participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions."
Members also believed that the statement should again note that both monetary policy accommodation and robust underlying productivity growth were continuing to support economic activity.
"A more forceful policy move than the 25 basis point increases that had been implemented since mid-1999 was desirable in light of the extraordinary and persisting strength of overall demand, exceeding even the increasingly rapid growth of potential supply, and the attendant indications of growing pressures in already tight markets for labor and other resources."
Some participants noted that additional asset purchases could be used to provide more accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates.
"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
"Most measures of business sentiment were still downbeat, analysts' expectations of firms' longer-term profit growth edged down further, and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms' investment decisions."
"With the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all of the members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
"Such an outcome seemed likely to generate further pressures on unit labor costs, which had tended in recent years to be contained by accelerating productivity."
"Regarding inflation, participants noted that on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
The unemployment rate remained at 5.
"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
A number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly.
The outlook continued to be for core inflation to pick up modestly over coming quarters owing to the lagged effects of higher energy prices but then to return to near current levels in 2007 primarily as the result of the restraining influence of falling energy prices.
"The number of new job losers as a percentage of household employment continued to drop, and the fraction of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons moved down since the end of last year."
Business demand for durable equipment apparently remained fairly robust in early 1996.
"However, the Central Bank of Brazil eased monetary policy to support economic growth."
"2 percent in February, and other indicators such as initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that pressures in labor markets had begun to abate."
"The decline in core CPI inflation over the same time period was much less, though this measure of inflation also remained relatively restrained."
"On balance, however, growth of economic activity appeared to have picked up after having slowed appreciably in late 1995."
The labor market deteriorated further in August as private payrolls declined and the unemployment rate moved markedly higher.
"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"Several also noted that, because monetary policy actions affected economic activity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requisite policy accommodation now to support economic activity over coming quarters."
The unemployment rate remained at 4.
Many of them saw the likely effects of recent developments on the path of economic activity and inflation as small or transitory.
"Participants anticipated that inflation would move toward the Committee's 2 percent goal in coming years, with several expressing concern that inflation might persist below the Committee's objective for quite some time."
The unemployment rate declined to 5.
"In Japan, available indicators suggested that economic activity had stagnated in the fourth quarter."
Participants also touched on the implications for monetary policy of changes in estimates of the economy's potential output.
"In addition, the effects of the stronger dollar on import prices along with increased economic slack would tend to damp inflation."
"However, a couple of participants were concerned that inflation could rise as the recovery continued and argued that providing additional monetary accommodation, or even maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run, would erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation."
"After only a modest increase early in the year, growth in household spending had strengthened in recent months."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose less in March than in the previous two months, but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was solid."
"Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased slightly over the year ending in the third quarter, and with a moderate rise in productivity, unit labor costs were essentially unchanged."
The Committee affirms that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.
"Market interest rates generally have declined somewhat further since the start of the Committee meeting on July 1-2, 1997."
"Although food prices continued their string of sizable increases, energy prices fell in June and July and gasoline prices appear to have dropped further in August."
"Over the intermeeting period, however, the Chairman's semiannual testimony on monetary policy, higher oil prices, and incoming data that showed a pickup in price inflation led market participants to mark up their expectations for the trajectory of the target federal funds rate."
"Gains in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector were quite muted over the year ending in the first quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged up, on balance, in November and early December, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were little changed and continued to run within the relatively narrow range that has prevailed for some time."
"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated."
"In addition, demand for funding of CMBS by hedge funds and real estate investment trusts reportedly rose over the same period."
"They cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the Committee's inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse, or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind."
"While the Committee saw uncertainty regarding the economic outlook as still elevated, it judged that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth."
"For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation, with associated costs to economic performance."
"Some participants pointed to anecdotal evidence regarding higher tariffs and uncertainty about trade policy, slowing global demand, rising input costs, or higher interest rates as possible factors contributing to the slowdown."
"Some members recalled that gains in employment strengthened in early 2010 and again in early 2011 only to diminish as those years progressed; moreover, the uncertain effects of the unusually mild winter weather were cited as making it harder to discern the underlying trend in the economic data."
"Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
"A few participants suggested that, before too long, the Committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen recently."
"One participant stated that the extended period of near-zero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry, as net interest margins remained under pressure."
They believed that current policy was accommodating excessive strength in aggregate demand that very likely would be felt in higher inflation before long.
"The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
"A few participants remarked that activity in the energy sector was especially weak, reflecting low petroleum prices, low profitability, and tight financing conditions for energy-producing firms."
Several participants also judged that patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the Committee's balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appeared to be high while inflation continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.
A few participants raised the possibility of an undesirable rise in inflation.
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow from this year's pace, but remain solid, with output staying near the economy's potential over the next two years."
"In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
Accommodative monetary policy and a recovery in financial markets along with an abatement of the downdraft in housing activity were expected to help foster a further pickup in economic growth in 2009.
"The Committee noted, however, that downside risks to growth remained, and indicated that it would act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."
"Indicators pointed to a continuing deceleration in house prices this quarter, and home mortgage borrowing probably continued to slow."
The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
Other members indicated that such policy action could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent over the medium run.
"On the one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in expected inflation on the part of market participants."
"The employment cost index showed a moderate rise over the period, boosted by a sizable increase in benefit costs in the first quarter."
"Consumer energy prices reversed a small part of their previous run-up, and core consumer inflation remained low."
The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
"The consensus opinion, however, was to replace the Committee's judgment about the likelihood of an increase or decrease in the intended federal funds rate with a description of the Committee's perception of the risks in the foreseeable future to the attainment of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth."
Most participants emphasized that it was important for the Committee to be prepared to adjust the pace of its purchases up or down as needed to align the degree of policy accommodation with changes in the outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as the extent of progress toward the Committee's economic objectives.
"Consumer price inflation was running below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"In their comments about the outlook for the foreign sector of the economy, members referred to indications of some overall improvement in foreign economic activity, which augured well for the growth in exports."
"Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate."
"However, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, would resume relatively good growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels; a projected recovery in the growth of foreign economies was seen as providing increased support for U. S. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in June and early July, while longer-term expectations declined."
"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
"Accordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following statement regarding the 1998 and 1999 ranges in its domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods.
"Later in the week, however, market interest rates moved up in response to the release of the minutes of the February meeting and the mention therein of some sentiment for a larger policy tightening than had been undertaken."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the July 30-31 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first half of the year.
Consumer energy prices had retreated notably from their elevated post-hurricane levels.
"The growth of M2 and M3 slowed in February, partly reflecting an unwinding of Y2K effects and rising opportunity costs of holding liquid balances."
"Headline inflation in emerging market economies eased, reflecting falling oil and food prices."
"In particular, the level and variability of reserve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations."
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in July after a June increase that was below the average for earlier months of the year.
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months.
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of a marked strengthening in the growth of economic activity."
"Primary credit extended by the Federal Reserve was about unchanged, and credit outstanding under the Term Auction Facility increased somewhat over the period as the February auctions experienced higher demand than previous auctions."
"Moreover, the staff expected that headline consumer price inflation would decline to about the same rate as core inflation in 2010 and 2011."
Low nominal wage inflation was also viewed as consistent with slack in labor markets.
"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
Business contacts indicated that the high level of energy prices was spurring coal mining activity.
"In an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility in financial asset values worldwide and a reduced appetite for risk among many investors, interest rates on U. S. Treasury securities, and to a much smaller extent on investment-grade corporate debt, fell appreciably during the intermeeting period; in contrast, yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms increased sharply, and a number of large banks tightened terms and standards for making business loans to sizable firms."
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of further weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted for some time."
"Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices."
The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services reached another new high in February as the value of imports rose sharply further and the value of exports changed little.
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
"Core consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such inflation from its current subdued level."
"While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stabil- ity and promote sustainable growth in output.
"However, key factors that influence consumer spendingâincluding the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low interest ratesâremained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
"A number of participants noted that, with the unemployment rate expected to remain below estimates of its longer-run normal rate, they anticipated wage inflation to pick up further."
"Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low, they were somewhat above the levels seen last year."
"Purchases were concentrated in nominal Treasury securities with maturities of 2 to 10 years, though some longer-term securities were purchased along with some Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)."
"However, production in the energy and steel sectors appeared to be strengthening, and industry contacts generally reported that demand for exported goods was buoyant."
"Participants expected solid growth in consumer spending in the near term, supported by ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and a high level of consumer sentiment."
"In that regard, participants were encouraged that, despite recent energy price increases, survey measures of inflation expectations had notched down and longer-term inflation compensation in financial markets was little changed."
"Industrial production fell in February, and private payroll employment posted a third consecutive monthly decline."
Most participants indicated that they made only small changes to their forecasts for achieving and maintaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation over the medium term.
"Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, fostered in part by stable inflation expectations and a likely deceleration in shelter costs."
"With the growth in output likely to remain below the expansion of the economy's potential for a while, members anticipated that inflation would remain subdued."
"For China and Singapore, real gross domestic product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter confirmed a rebound in economic growth."
"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low."
"In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted the contrast between the strength of incoming data on economic activity and the concerns about downside risks evident in financial markets and in reports from business contacts."
Most national indexes of house prices stayed on a downward trajectory.
The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also strengthened over recent months in response to heavy private demands for credit.
"Changes in other asset prices were generally more modest but were consistent with improved sentiment: The Treasury yield curve steepened a little, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately, and the exchange value of the dollar depreciated modestly."
The members' basic concern about the outlook for inflation related to the possibility that continued strength in demand might not be accommodated without placing greater pressures on labor compensation and prices.
The 12-month change in the core PCE price index was 1.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its July projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
"A couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations; in addition, as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors, these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability."
"Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending was subject to a number of downside risks that included the possibility of rising unemployment and further weakness in the stock market, which could damp consumer confidence as well as income and wealth."
"Overall inflation receded in June because of a decline in energy prices, while the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose a bit less than its average pace over the past year."
"The pace of expansion in Latin America likely declined some in the first quarter, largely because the Mexican economy slowed in the wake of softer growth in the United States."
"Preliminary survey measures of short-term inflation expectations in March edged up, but longer-term measures remained steady."
"In foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose on balance, apparently due, in part, to disappointing news on employment and output abroad."
"Inflation was continuing to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, reflecting in part continued reductions in oil prices and falling import prices."
"As pressures from these sources lessened over the remainder of 2008 and in 2009, both core and headline price inflation were projected to edge down, and headline inflation was expected to moderate to a pace slightly below core inflation."
"Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably."
"Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were little changed on balance."
"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2."
"In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board's staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from mid-August to early September."
"The risks of waiting seemed small at this juncture, in part because inflation and inflation expectations were not likely to worsen substantially in the near term, and the Committee had demonstrated its willingness to take needed anticipatory action to curb rising inflationary pressures that could threaten the overall performance of the economy."
"Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the advanced foreign economies contracted more moderately in the second quarter than in the first quarter, with growth resuming in several countries."
"Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
"With inflationary pressures waning and the downside risks to the global economic outlook increasing, some central banks eased policy."
Wage and price pressures were generally still modest.
"Participants mentioned several apparent factors underlying the recent financial market turbulence, including economic and financial developments in China and other foreign countries, spillovers in financial markets from stresses at firms and in countries that are producers of energy and other commodities, and an increase in concerns among market participants regarding the prospects for domestic economic growth."
"Late in the period, equity prices retraced some of their gains, as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighed negatively on risk sentiment."
"Housing construction was projected to drift lower over coming quarters, partly in conjunction with the rise in mortgage interest rates that already had occurred but also in response to the smaller increases expected in household income."
"Exports of industrial supplies and agricultural goods registered the largest increases, although rising prices accounted for some of those gains."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity remained rapid.
"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs."
The Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants indicated that the median expectation of CPI inflation 5 to 10 years ahead was essentially unchanged in January.
The Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
The strength of housing demand was also reflected in further rapid gains in home prices.
"Core consumer prices accelerated during the three months ended in May, largely reflecting higher tobacco prices and shelter costs."
"Participants expressed significant concerns about the upside risks to inflation, especially the risk that persistently high headline inflation could result in an unmooring of long-run inflation expectations."
"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had changed little in recent months."
"Broad equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, bolstered by favorable incoming economic data."
"Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release."
The information reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed substantially from its rapid first-quarter pace.
"Most borrowers in the residential mortgage market continued to experience accommodative financing conditions, although the increase in mortgage rates since 2016 appeared to have reduced housing demand, and financing conditions remained somewhat tight for borrowers with low credit scores."
"In this connection, a couple of participants suggested that, if it decided to provide more policy accommodation at the present juncture, the Committee might be taking out too much insurance against possible future shocks, leaving monetary policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the event that such shocks materialized."
"A few participants, however, favored no change in the target range at this meeting, judging that the absence of signs of upward inflation pressure afforded the Committee some latitude to wait and see how the data would develop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty about the global economic growth outlook."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably over the intermeeting period.
Recent information indicated that economic activity in the foreign industrial countries had decelerated since the fourth quarter.
"Participants' contacts in the energy sector reported that firms were still adjusting to lower prices and the contraction in their businesses, and some firms expected that they would need to cut investment and employment further."
One risk bearing on that outlook was the possibility that prices in equity markets might continue to decline and perhaps even overadjust to lower earnings expectations.
"Such an approach was viewed as allowing for a faster return to a normal policy environment, potentially reducing any upside risks to inflation stemming from outsized reserve balances, and more quickly eliminating any effects of SOMA holdings of agency securities on the allocation of credit."
The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"Recent surveys showed further hefty increases in retail gasoline prices in February and early March, and prices of nonfuel industrial commodities also rose sharply on net."
"In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised up slightly its estimated increase in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2007 but revised down its projected increase for the first half of 2008."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"In the view of many members, equity prices and risk spreads in U. S. financial markets previously had embodied an overly optimistic assessment of business prospects and they saw some correction in these markets as a positive development."
"After a sluggish fourth quarter, private nonfarm payroll employment rose at a slightly higher rate on average in January and February, though still considerably below the pace of the first three quarters of 2000."
"Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
Total PCE inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective.
"Euro-area peripheral spreads to German equivalents moved sharply lower, and far-forward inflation compensation recovered modestly."
"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"Amid lower interest rates as well as further indications that the contraction in economic activity may have ended, broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period."
"By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts."
"These tentative signs of a recovery of economic activity were supported by other factors, including recent rises in house and equity prices that would support household net worth, declines in interest rates on corporate bonds and fixed-rate mortgages, and a stronger outlook for activity in foreign economies."
Many participants anticipated that such a program would provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and promoting more accommodative financial conditions.
"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity."
"The extent and timing of any additional firming that might be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
"On balance, M2 grew rapidly over the September-October period, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates and perhaps the deposit of federal tax rebates."
"Nonetheless, members reported considerable nonresidential building activity in several parts of the country, and nationwide such activity was expected to help sustain modest growth in overall nonresidential construction in coming quarters."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September."
"While these factors might well continue to damp the growth of consumer spending going forward, members noted that consumer confidence remained at a high level, consumer incomes were rising, and no anecdotal or other evidence pointed to any marked deterioration in consumer spending that would pose a potential threat to the sustainability of the economic expansion."
"However, core consumer price measures also displayed a gradual uptrend, perhaps only in part as a consequence of the passthrough effects of persistently high energy prices."
"With economic activity projected to expand at a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over the coming year, hiring was projected to continue to firm, causing the unemployment rate to edge down next year."
"Measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year."
"Consumer energy prices declined in November and December, and survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of January."
"In addition, market commentaries observed that, despite low inflation readings in recent months, the characterization of the inflation outlook in the September policy statement was little changed and the SEP showed only modest downward revisions to FOMC participants' near-term inflation projections."
"4 percent in October, as the rise in energy prices since the spring offset much of the decline earlier in the year."
"Participants generally expected that inflation would edge down over the next few years, a projection consistent with the recent string of encouraging releases on core consumer prices, futures prices pointing to a flattening of energy costs, and the anticipated easing of pressures on resources."
"The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to Â¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. """
"System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U. S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1."
"In the current uncertain environment, this would afford the Committee an opportunity to gauge the momentum of the expansion and the related degree of pressure on resources and prices."
"However, economic activity continued to be depressed in areas affected by the downturn in the energy sector and falling agricultural commodity prices, alÂ­though several participants noted that the recent firming in crude oil prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity."
The rate of money growth consistent with price stability depends on the average growth of real GDP.
"Conditions in the agricultural sector remained weak, partly as a result of low commodity prices."
The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff's assessment was that the downside risks associated with monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast.
"Despite the rise in oil prices and quickening pace of economic activity, both market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations seemed to remain quite well anchored."
"However, a couple of participants indicated that the drop in some survey-based measures of inflation expectations could be explained by a decline in the number of respondents who had previously expected relatively high inflation outcomes."
"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability were roughly equal."
"However, participants viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with the modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and, consequently, as not exerting much upward pressure on inflation."
Some participants cited stronger growth abroad and robust nonresidential investment spending as potentially contributing more to activity than expected.
"Several participants observed that consumer spending had outpaced growth in personal disposable income last year, and a few noted that households remained pessimistic about their income prospects and uncertain about the economic outlook."
"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward."
Some participants saw the decline in yields on Treasury securities and other instruments as an indication that the expansion of excess reserve balances was putting downward pressure on market rates; some others viewed the configuration of rate movements as consistent with reduced concerns about inflation and with lower term premiums in a more settled economic environment.
"Measures of expected longer-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
"However, some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
"With growth in the demand for labor slowing, initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to trend upward, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 4 percent in November, its average thus far this year."
"Although the economic outlook generally seemed favorable, there was also broad recognition of greater uncertainty attending the outlook for both inflation and output growth."
"Data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, suggested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected, and this faster pace seemed consistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter."
"Participants generally noted that, with apparently significant slack in labor and product markets, slow wage growth, and little evidence of pricing power among firms, inflation was likely to decline somewhat over time."
"For example, the higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers, greater inequality of income and wealth--which would imply a lower aggregate propensity to spend--or changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment."
"Absent a possible moderation, an upturn in unit labor costs was seen as a likely possibility, with eventual adverse implications for price inflation."
"As output growth slowed, pressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat."
"At the producer level, prices fell in July, leaving the twelve-month change in the producer price index for finished goods somewhat below the twelve-month change of a year earlier."
"Information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that, in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances, banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis."
"In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board's staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP, along with some other high-frequency measuresâsuch as employment at small businesses and job postingsâsuggested that employment gains had slowed since mid-June but likely were still strong."
The growth of domestic nonfinancial debt slowed somewhat in July and August in association with some moderation in the brisk pace of private borrowing that was offset in part by a less rapid paydown of federal debt.
"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
A sharp increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks was suggestive of additional deterioration in labor markets.
Stock prices for large and regional domestic banking firms outperformed the broad equity market over the intermeeting period amid better-than-expected economic data and the settlement of mortgage-related litigation by some large banking organizations.
"Readings on a range of price measures--including the PCE price index, the CPI, and a number of the analytical measures developed at the Reserve Banks--appeared to provide evidence that inflation had moved up recently from low levels earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee's forecast of a gradual increase in inflation over the medium term."
The Committee also anticipates that the caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums so that the Federal Reserve's securities holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
"However, demand for CRE loans reportedly strengthened, and CRE loans on banks' books continued to grow at a robust pace over the first quarter."
Some members judged that persistent slack in resource utilization posed downside risks to the outlook for inflation.
"Continuing claims for unemployment insurance through regular state programs also moved down, but the average length of spells of unemployment continued to increase."
"These changes included the long period during which the federal funds rate was at the ELB, the probable recurrence of ELB episodes if the neutral level of the policy rate remains at historically low levels, and the challenges that policymakers face in influencing inflation and inflation expectations when the response of inflation to resource utilization has diminished."
"Growth in employment remained robust in the service-producing sector in the April-May period, but the number of jobs fell in the goods-producing sector: payrolls in manufacturing and mining continued to contract, and construction employment changed little on net after a sizable first-quarter increase."
"The pace of improvement in labor market conditions moderated somewhat, and the unemployment rate was unchanged over the intermeeting period."
"The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only slightly in September; the increase was well below its average monthly advance over the preceding twelve months, reflecting a drop in prices of some chemicals that have a high energy content."
The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
"Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting both favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a continuing decline in core inflation."
"However, because of the recent further decline in crude oil prices, many participants judged that falling energy prices would depress headline inflation somewhat longer than previously anticipated."
"Short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on February 2-3, 1999, while longer-term rates have risen somewhat on balance."
"On the upside, in the absence of strongly retarding effects from developments in Asia, persistent strength in domestic final demand might well add to inflationary pressures."
Nonfarm payroll employment posted sizable further gains in January and February.
"In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserveâs semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004."
"The deputy manager followed with a briefing on open market operations and developments in money markets, including investment flows and changes in market interest rates in anticipation of the upcoming implementation of reforms to the money market fund (MMF) industry."
"Major U. S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, with the S&P 500 equity index returning to the levels it reached before its decline in the last quarter of 2018."
Members generally expected economic activity to expand at a pace below the rate of growth of potential output in the near term before strengthening some over time.
"Finally, some participants noted that if the very large size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet led the public to doubt the Committee's ability to withdraw monetary accommodation when doing so becomes appropriate, the result could be upward pressure on inflation expectations and so on actual inflation."
The latest sales data suggested that demand for new houses may be strengthening after stabilizing in the early portion of this year.
"Inflation had been subdued of late, although the recent increase in crude oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily."
"Inflation compensation based on 5-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) increased, apparently owing in part to an announcement by the Treasury of a smaller-than-expected amount of issuance of TIPS next year."
"In addition, the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated."
"As a result, as in the January forecast, real GDP was expected to rise at a moderate pace over 2011 and 2012, supported by accommodative monetary policy, increasing credit availability, and greater household and business confidence."
"On balance, a substantial pickup in overall capital spending seemed likely to be delayed in the absence of surprising strength in final demand, but a wide range of possible outcomes could not be ruled out for this key sector of the economy."
"Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
Committee members generally agreed that higher energy prices had played an important role in the recent moderation of economic growth.
"More recently, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that the job losses associated with the hurricane were subsiding."
"In that regard, they continue to serve the useful purpose of benchmarking money growth consistent with the Committee's long-run goal of price stability."
"Nominal forward rates further out the yield curve fell about the same amount as real forward rates, implying little change in far-forward inflation compensation."
Further declines in house prices led to a noticeable decrease in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income in the fourth quarter.
"Participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, with strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
"In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"Among the advanced foreign economies, headline equity price indexes generally fell significantly over the period, with the sharpest drops in the banking sector."
"Economic expansion in Japan appeared to have slowed markedly, and growth in the euro area remained sluggish."
"Given this economic outlook, the Committee agreed to continue to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities as announced in November in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Committee's mandate."
"Although the data on aggregate spending and inflation received over the intermeeting period were, on balance, weaker than participants expected, they generally saw the outlook for the economy and inflation as little changed and judged that a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation remained appropriate."
"President Rosengren dissented because he did not see a clear and compelling case for additional accommodation at this time given that the unemployment rate stood near 50-year lows, inflation seemed likely to rise toward the Committee's 2 percent target, and financial stability concerns were elevated, as indicated by near-record equity prices and corporate leverage."
"However, the level of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained high."
The Manager noted that a coupon swap is a common transaction in the market for MBS in which the two counterparties exchange securities at market prices.
"At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"Given the policy tradeoffs confronting the FOMC at this time, Mr. Fisher saw the upside risks to inflation as being greater than the downside risks to longer-term economic growth, especially in light of the recent, aggressive easing of monetary policy and the lag before it would have its full effect on the economy."
The dollar changed little on net against the German mark and other continental European currencies; declines in long-term interest rates in those countries generally matched the drop in yields on comparable U. S. instruments.
"The rate of increase in real GDP was expected to pick up gradually as the drag from the contraction in residential construction diminished, returning towards the end of 2007 to a rate close to the staff's estimate of potential output growth."
"However, the staff's forecasts for core inflation and, thus, for total inflation were revised down slightly for next year, reflecting the judgment that a bit of the unexplained weakness in core inflation this year may carry over into next year."
Rising foreclosures were seen as likely to continue to add to downward pressure on house prices.
"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation."
"Liquidity in the TIPS market reportedly continued to be poor, making unclear the extent to which movements in TIPS inflation compensation reflected changes in investors' expectations of future inflation."
Wholesale and retail gasoline prices dropped as gasoline inventories rebounded.
"Consequently, it was likely that actual productivity growth was higher than the current measures indicated."
"Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May, but crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in the spring."
"After changing little on net during the preceding year, interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages moved lower in May and June."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."
"The Japanese economy contracted in the quarter, and growth in the euro area appeared to have weakened substantially."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"On the other hand, such redemptions could put upward pressure on interest rates and would tend to work against the objective of returning the SOMA to an all-Treasuries composition."
A few others noted uncertainty about the strength of domestic economic activity going forward.
"Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
"Committee Policy Action In the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that the Committee should complete its $600 billion asset purchase program at the end of the month and that no changes to the target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting."
"The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
Falling energy prices held down headline consumer prices in April and May while core consumer prices edged up.
"The evidently higher pace of productivity growth was very encouraging, though it was still difficult to assess how long this favorable performance might last and the extent to which it might ease the price pressures that could emerge if the economic expansion did not moderate as members anticipated."
"Furthermore, a couple of participants saw, as possible sources of financial instability, the pace of increase in real estate prices in the multifamily segment and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities of certain government-sponsored enterprises."
"Incoming information pointed to stable, low inflation that was running a little below the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent."
"In their view, an asymmetric directive would be more consistent with the consensus among the Committee members regarding the most likely course of monetary policy over the next few meetings and the use of the bias statement that had come to encompass this longer horizon and was understood as such by financial market participants and the public."
"This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.
"Rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset the effect on energy prices of some of the output losses in refined products."
M3 also continued to be boosted by the rapid growth of money market mutual funds.
"Of course, if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, in order to foster achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate objectives."
"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has moderated appre ciably from an elevated second-quarter pace."
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined for the year to date and were running below 2 percent."
"However, both the 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation remained near the lower ends of their historical ranges."
A persistence of inflation at recent rates could eventually have adverse consequences for economic performance.
"Accordingly, they agreed that those ranges should not reflect or be centered on forecasts of money growth under projected economic and financial conditions, but should be regarded as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with approximate price stability and sustained economic expansion, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience."
The staff's forecasts for both total and core PCE price inflation over the 2020â22 period were essentially unrevised.
"Moreover, questions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output."
They agreed that maintaining a low level of short-term interest rates and relying on the use of balance sheet policies and communications about monetary policy would be effective and appropriate in light of the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook and the appreciable easing of inflationary pressures.
Household spending was rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.
"In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices, the sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist for some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going forward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future and wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or taking on new workers."
"They agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature in the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately, that the Federal Reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a a modest upward trajectory in price inflation."
"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
"Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to fade."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
"On balance, members saw moderate further growth in consumer spending as a reasonable prospect for coming quarters."
"Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
"On balance, however, credit conditions were likely to remain tighter and equity prices lower than earlier, and in the context of continued damped inflation, monetary policy had the room to adjust to these new circumstances."
"In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised down its estimate of growth in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter."
This view took account of the continued availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms but also of expectations of a more moderate growth trend in sales and the substantial buildup that had already occurred in stocks of equipment and structures.
"While a greater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects through the economy could not be ruled out, the underlying strength of demand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate growth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and production adjustments subsided."
"Employment had risen a little, but not enough to lower the unemployment rate, and labor productivity seemed to be trending sharply upward."
"However, the staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, as the slightly weaker underlying pace of economic activity suggested by the recent data was roughly offset by the anticipated effects of the continuation of the maturity extension program announced following the June FOMC meeting, which had not been incorporated in the previous projection."
"Among other factors that needed to be taken into account, it was observed that neutral real short-term interest rates could decline further if central bank balance sheets contracted or the positive effects of quantitative easing on economic activity waned over time."
"In its forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak first-quarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economy's long-run potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008."
"U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, rose at a slow rate in the first quarter, though somewhat faster than the pace posted in the fourth quarter, and were about 1 percent higher than a year earlier."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey declined in September and early October, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were little changed."
"Given the improved economic prospects, the decline in longer-term Treasury yields and the apparent marking down of the implied path for the policy interest rate were seen as somewhat puzzling but supportive of recovery."
"More broadly, although interest rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise, consumer credit expanded at a solid pace."
"Against a background of weakening growth in Japan and continued uncertainty about the prospects for fiscal stimulus in that country, the dollar rose considerably against the yen."
Meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates.
Reduced demand for mortgage refinancing and lower nonwithheld federal payments also contributed importantly to the weakness in the broad monetary aggregates.
"On the other hand, slowing job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in labor demand, which may be consistent with an observed decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other measures of labor market tightness."
"The staff's forecast for inflation over the projection period was just a bit above the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting somewhat higher-than-expected data on core consumer prices and a slightly narrower margin of economic slack than in the March forecast."
The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
Market participants pointed to a larger-than-expected increase in average hourly earnings in the January employment report as a factor triggering increased investor concerns about inflation and the associated pace of interest rate increases.
"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors."
"Moreover, households' net worth likely increased as equity prices and home values advanced further, and consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was still near its highest level since prior to the most recent recession."
"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
"Further monetary policy and fiscal policy support in foreign countries, the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, and a stronger-than-expected U. S. May employment report outweighed concerns about otherwise weak global economic data and the resurgence of U. S. âChina tensions."
A number of them argued that several indicators of labor underutilization--including the low labor force participation rate and the still-elevated rates of longer-duration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons--suggested that there is more slack in the labor market than is captured by the unemployment rate alone.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"While the recent data suggested markedly slower growth in consumer spending in the first quarter than seen in 2015, most participants expected to see a pickup in the growth rate of consumer spending in coming months in light of the still-solid fundamental determinants of household spending."
"The price index for PCE excluding food and energy (the core PCE price index) rose slightly in January, boosted by an uptick in prices of core goods after four months of declines; the 12-month change in this core price index stayed near the very low levels seen in late 2010."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"Retail money market mutual funds and small time deposits contracted in both months, probably in response to declining interest rates on these assets."
"Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stock- sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some sectors strongly affected by the nation's trade deficit."
Participants stressed that any such step had to be consistent with the statutory objectives for monetary policy.
"Despite the higher rates of headline inflation earlier in the year, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained and slack in resource markets was seen as persisting, leading the Committee to expect underlying inflation to be relatively low."
"Payroll employment persisted on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production seemed likely to record only modest further expansion in the second quarter."
"Slowing growth in profit levels and cash flows was likely to retard spending for many types of business equipment, but favorable prices, advancing technology, and readily available financing probably would continue to foster rapid expansion in office, computing, and communications equipment."
Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed somewhat over the July-August period.
"In contrast, one member judged that maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation beyond the near term would likely be inappropriate; that member anticipated that a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be necessary before the end of 2014 to keep inflation close to 2 percent."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in June suggested that economic activity had decelerated in recent months to a slower pace than they had anticipated."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially in the fourth quarter from its average rate in the third quarter.
"The average workweek was unchanged in September, so with employment lower, aggregate hours declined slightly."
"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"Real disposable income rose further in July, as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and energy prices came down."
"In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), especially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weakened further, though they remained consistent with positive economic growth."
Several participants observed that the recent employment reports had increased the uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market.
"Mortgage interest rates held steady around 4 percent, and origination volumes continued to be low."
"With regard to labor costs, growth in the employment cost index (ECI) for hourly compensation picked up noticeably in the first quarter of this year; however, the gain in compensation for the four quarters ended in March was a little below the large increase for the four-quarter period ended in March 2000."
"Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."
"Members agreed to continue to include, in the forward guidance, language indicating that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
"The price of crude oil fell further over the intermeeting period, and many participants lowered their near-term forecasts for inflation somewhat while leaving their medium-term forecasts little changed."
The downturn in equity prices since December further reduced household wealth in the first quarter.
"Although hurricane-related rebuilding would boost activity, especially in the near term, this stimulus increasingly would be countered by higher interest rates, the anticipated waning of the positive wealth effect associated with large earlier gains in equity and house prices, and reduced impetus from fiscal policy."
"Consumer price inflation rose further above the slow pace seen during the first half of last year, but it was still running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
"In the United States, overall personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices were estimated to have fallen in December, largely reflecting significant reductions in energy prices."
The unemployment rate stayed at 5.
"However, different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and, consequently, appropriate monetary policy."
"However, one participant suggested that the leveraged loan market seemed to be moving into better balance, and that market participants appeared to be taking appropriate account of the changes in interest rates that might be associated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy."
"For this year as a whole, a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real GDP growth, reflecting, in part, the strong first-quarter reading."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had edged down.
"The Committee's action and its announcement surprised markets only a little, and bond and stock prices edged a bit lower."
"The ratio of wealth to income likely declined again in the second quarter, as equity prices declined, on balance, and house prices continued to fall."
"At the same time, members anticipated that growth, if any, in homebuilding activity would be subdued over the next several quarters after an extended period of strong expansion."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."
"Employers were continuing to resist pressures to grant unusually large wage increases, and the persistence of vigorous competition, including that from Asian imports, was preventing most business firms from passing cost increases through to prices."
Several participants also commented on the uncertainty about the outlook for productivity growth or about the potential effects of tight labor markets on labor supply and inflation.
"To keep inflation expectations well anchored, all agreed on the importance of the Federal Reserve continuing to communicate that it has the tools and willingness to begin withdrawing monetary policy accommodation at the appropriate time and pace to prevent any persistent increase in inflation."
"Given their increased uncertainty about how global economic and financial developments might evolve, participants emphasized the importance of closely monitoring these developments and of assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
Business efforts to bring their inventories into better alignment with sales were a key factor in the deceleration of overall economic activity in recent quarters and in forecasts that the upturn in economic activity would be relatively limited over the balance of the year.
"While growth of business capital spending moderated somewhat after a fourth-quarter surge, it was still quite rapid."
"A couple noted that a step-up in the pace of economic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with substantially overshooting full employment."
"Private-sector employment rose further in July and August, but the unemployment rate was still elevated."
"The Committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
"Gains in payroll employment had moderated, and the unemployment rate appeared to have stabilized after a period of decline."
"With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants noted that providing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point."
"Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses was near zero in the fourth quarter after declining in the third, consistent with weak demand for credit and still tight credit standards and terms at banks."
The incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants' expectations.
"Participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation would move up to or toward the Committee's objective over the medium term."
"These revisions reflected incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected, although the recent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social-distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months."
"As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace."
"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives."
"Private nonfarm employment rose at an appreciably faster average pace in January and February than in the fourth quarter of last year, and declines in total government employment slowed in recent months."
"Prices of existing homes again rose briskly, while price appreciation for new homes moderated somewhat."
"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity."
"While growth abroad could be expected to rebound next year, responding in part to faster expansion in the U. S. economy, the nearer-term outlook for U. S. and indeed world trade was less favorable."
"Members also agreed that economic growth seemed likely to slow over coming quarters, but that the easing action taken at the meeting--combined with the 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate at the September meeting--should help to promote moderate growth over time, although some downside risks to growth would remain."
"A number of factors supported a projection of considerably more moderate expansion going forward in relation to the overly rapid pace in the second half of 1999 and early 2000, including the likelihood that much of the effect on spending of the rise in interest rates and leveling out in equity prices this year had not yet been felt."
"Meanwhile, after a small rise in July, the prices of finished goods faced by producers moved down a bit in August."
"Under such conditions, the staff projected that real GDP would expand at a rate well above that of its potential, that the unemployment rate would decline significantly, and that overall and core personal consumption expenditures inflation would stay low."
Price and wage inflation had remained relatively stable in recent months.
"Altogether, the change in real net exports was estimated to have made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
"Although mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS edged down to near their historical lows, mortgage refinancing activity continued to be subdued amid tight underwriting standards and low levels of home equity."
"Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen."
Developments in the food and energy sectors contributed to a slightly faster advance in consumer prices in May.
"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, and market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low."
"However, the pace of increases in employment had slowed some, on net, in recent months."
"The weakness was widespread across categories and likely reflected rising vacancy rates, falling property prices, and difficult financing conditions for new projects."
"In these circumstances, it was possible that inflation would continue to be contained, though the risks clearly seemed to be tilted in the direction that action would become necessary at some point to keep inflation low."
"While the direct effect of higher energy prices on real disposable income could account for only a relatively small part of the reduction in the growth of consumer spending, some members suggested that those effects may have been exacerbated by substantial increases in expected future energy costs as well as greater uncertainty about those costs."
"With the cushion of unutilized labor resources having dwindled over recent years and with the willingness of global investors to continue to acquire dollar assets to finance major further increases in imports at current interest and exchange rates in question, the need to achieve the appropriate financial and economic balance had become more pressing."
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in December.
"Although downside risks to sustainable growth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower growth of economic activity as likely to be transitory."
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand more slowly over the projection period than it had in recent years.
"With regard to labor costs, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private industry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase."
"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term."
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would moderate gradually to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in May and early June; longer-term inflation expectations in the survey also were essentially flat and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for a number of years.
"Still, participants thought that a slight decrease in pressures on resources and the stability of inflation expectations likely would foster over time a gradual moderation in core inflation."
"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent."
"Thereafter, the forecast for inflation was essentially unrevised."
"Various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings."
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand strongly in January and February.
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services in October was little changed from its September level but was slightly smaller than its average for the third quarter.
"One member preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting, stating that the Committee should ease policy at this meeting to re-center inflation and inflation expectations at the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
"Emerging market asset prices were generally resilient over the intermeeting period; the dollar was weaker against most emerging market currencies, and flows into emerging market assets surged."
"Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared to have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year."
Inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation-protected securities decreased recently in response to low readings on inflation and falling oil prices.
"Thus far, the rise in compensation had been held down by diminishing increases in worker benefit costs, and productivity gains also appeared to have had a favorable effect on unit labor costs."
"Abroad, central bank policy rates were lowered in the euro area, England, and Canada in response to indications of flagging economic activity."
"Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Private-sector employment increased further in June, but the unemployment rate was still elevated."
"Business investment spending retained strong upward momentum, though it had exhibited an uneven growth pattern in recent quarters that importantly reflected Y2K effects."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
"For now, however, there were few signs of rising price inflation despite widespread indications of very tight labor markets, including reports of further tightening in some areas."
"At this meeting, a staff presentation discussed three issues related to the existing statement that might warrant elaboration or clarification: whether inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and inflation similarly persistently above that objective would be regarded as equally undesirable, whether additional information should be provided about the ""balanced approach"" that the Committee takes in promoting its two objectives under circumstances in which these objectives are judged not to be complementary, and how financial stability is linked to the Committee's mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability."
Consumer prices were about unchanged in June after posting notable increases earlier in the year.
"Low inflation persisted in most EMEs as well, alÂ­though rising food prices continued to put upward pressure on inflation in Mexico."
A number of factors were expected to support near-term expansion in economic activity.
"Nonetheless, the low level of resource utilization was projected to result in an appreciable deceleration in core consumer prices through 2010."
"Increases in core measures of prices were limited and sizable declines in oil and commodity prices should help to moderate inflation going forward, in part by holding down inflation expectations."
"Indeed, many business contacts again reported that they would be cautious in hiring, saying they expected to meet any near-term increase in demand by raising existing employees' hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add employees."
"This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
Long-duration unemployment continued to recede somewhat but was still very high.
The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
"These included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions, the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus, an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels, and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes."
"Although equity prices in many countries rallied modestly late in the intermeeting period, global equity prices declined, on balance, over the period, with especially large net decreases in Japan and many emerging market economies."
"Even so, the outlook for jobs and income and the buildup of financial wealth constituted favorable home affordability factors that appeared likely to support a continuing high level of housing demand, especially in the single-family sector."
"Other factors that may have been contributing to the subdued pace of wage increases reported in the national data included low productivity growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, and competitive pressure on employers to hold down their costs."
Many participants commented that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maintaining trend economic growth--the so-called neutral rate--appeared to be lower currently or was likely to be lower in the longer run than they had estimated earlier.
"However, others pointed out that market participants seemed to have little doubt about the Committee's determination to keep inflation low and in that context markets were likely to anticipate Committee action once incoming information suggested it was becoming appropriate."
"During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants also commented on different concepts of the equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, a reference value of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate consistent with the economy achieving, over a specified time horizon, maximum employment and price stability."
Committee members interpreted recent data and anecdotal information as indicating that growth in consumer spending was rebounding fr om its relatively slow rate of late spring.
Growth in consumer spending had slowed sharply and a surge in inventory accumulation had accounted for much of the expansion of economic activity in the second quarter.
Members expected the unemployment rate to decline gradually.
Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.
"Real GDP was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise, on net, in the first half of this year."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"The members agreed that the risks to their price forecasts were in the direction of higher inflation, given already high levels of capacity use and their expectations of appreciable further economic growth."
"In some Districts, employers were also expanding training and provision of nonwage benefits, which could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a background of a very tight national labor market without spurring above-trend aggregate wage growth."
"Also, several observed that the additional appreciation of the dollar would continue to hold down the prices of imported goods."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
"Although an expansion of such purchases might provide additional support to the economy, the effects of further asset purchases, especially purchases of Treasury securities, on the economy and on inflation expectations were uncertain."
"Aggregate demand currently appeared to be growing at a pace a little below the rate of increase in the economy's output potential, a configuration that could well persist in coming quarters."
"Even so, the ongoing strength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and net exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic activity over the year ahead."
The expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with large earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.
"However, some nonlabor input prices already were rising faster."
"In the Committeeâs discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members commented that the information that had become available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the year progressed."
"During the twelve months ending in March, overall inflation rose at a slightly faster pace than that in the preceding twelve-month period, while core prices for the same period increased a bit more slowly than in the previous year."
"Members indicated that they expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace."
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
The reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to more moderate rates over coming months.
"It also acknowledged the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since its asset purchase program began, while emphasizing that it was prepared to be patient and await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting downward the pace of purchases."
"In contrast, goods exports by September recovered only two-thirds of their decline since January despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural products and industrial supplies."
"At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods over the twelve months ended in October was at a very low rate."
Some participants noted that the increase in mortgage interest rates since the spring was having a greater effect on that sector than they had anticipated earlier.
Indicators of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities showed mixed changes and remained within the ranges observed over recent years.
The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested mixed results.
"In their evaluation of the appropriate policy for these changing circumstances, the members agreed that the critical issue was whether the expansion would stabilize near its recent growth rate or was continuing to slow."
"A couple of these members observed that, because monetary policy actions affected aggregate spending with a lag, the present meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing accommodation that would support economic activity in the period ahead."
"In this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and while those risks appeared to be quite limited for the nearer term, excessive monetary stimulus had to be avoided to avert rising inflation expectations and added inflation pressures over time."
"AlÂ­though job gains had slowed from their pace in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year had exceeded most estimates discussed by participants of monthly payroll increases that could be expected to prevail with economic growth proceeding at its longer-run trend rate."
The period of subpar expansion was expected to foster an easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year was somewhat lower than in the projection for the January meeting."
"With market functioning seen as having largely recovered, many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering accommodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the Committee's employment and inflation goals."
"Although some house price indexes had risen in recent months, such indexes remained below year-earlier levels."
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the AprilâMay FOMC meeting was revised up on net.
"The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
"It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy."
"However, recent house price developments were mixed, with reports of incipient softness in some markets, including high-end properties, and overall house price inflation was seen as likely to slow in coming quarters."
"In the EMEs, inflation fell in China in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in food prices, but was pushed up in Mexico by fuel price hikes and pass-through from past currency depreciation."
"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee agreed to continue carefully monitoring actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"In the fourth quarter, bank credit continued to increase as banks accumulated agency MBS and growth of total loans picked up."
Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in November were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion."
They noted several indicators other than the unemployment rate that pointed to remaining underutilization of labor resources; these indicators included the still-high rate of involuntary part-time employment and the low level of the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed while growth in economic activity appeared to have picked up."
"With regard to economic activity abroad, the available information indicated that, on balance, foreign economic output had rebounded in the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries."
"A few others, however, pointed to evidence that weak aggregate demand was the primary factor restraining job growth, citing data and analyses in support of the view that there was still a substantial margin of slack in the labor market."
"However, this shortfall partly reflected the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports, and some participants pointed out that, by some measures, the most recent monthly inflation readings had firmed a bit."
The unemployment rate was 7.
"With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
"While the members continued to see a fairly brief and limited decrease in economic activity as the most likely outcome, they also agreed that the risks to such a forecast were strongly tilted to the downside."
A number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.
"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, although recent economic data had been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid."
"Although business purchases of motor vehicles declined in October and November, growth in investment in nontransportation equipment appeared to have been well maintained in the fourth quarter."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the March 19-20 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, alÂ­though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid fourth-quarter pace."
"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications."
"Although a jump in energy prices pushed up headline inflation somewhat, core consumer price inflation remained subdued."
"In their assessment of business conditions in different parts of the country, the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks commented on indications of some slowing in the expansion of regional economic activity in a majority of the districts, though several emphasized that the available information pointed to only slight moderation to date."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers declined in early December, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
"Major U. S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, with broadâbased gains across sectors."
"A couple of participants expressed the view that, when the rate of labor productivity growth was taken into account, the pace of recent wage gains was consistent with an economy operating near full employment."
"Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate."
"Indeed, a few participants were concerned that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might be below the mandate-consistent rate for some time."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
Other members believed that growth of the economy was not likely to slow enough to alleviate excess demands for resources and that additional tightening would be needed sooner rather than later to moderate inflationary pressures and prolong the expansion.
The staff reported on projections of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet under various assumptions about economic and financial conditions and the associated path of monetary policy.
"Most other domestic market interest rates moved down on balance during the intermeeting period, apparently as a result of increased concerns over the turbulence in Asia and its potential implications for the U. S. economy."
It was noted that very low interest rates were negatively affecting pension funds and the profitability of the life insurance industry.
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"And strong growth in imports in July and August, driven in part by a surge in oil imports, suggested that net exports probably posed an arithmetic drag on economic growth in the third quarter."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities."
"Both the total and core measures of consumer prices increased only slightly in January and February, and core inflation for the twelve months ended in February was somewhat lower than for the year-earlier period."
"The core consumer price index (CPI) rose in July at about the same pace as in the second quarter, but the twelve-month change in that index had increased slightly."
"Other interest rates generally moved lower over the period, extending declines that had begun during the spring."
"Asset prices were influenced by a number of factors, including reports concerning trade tensions among the United States and its major trading partners, foreign monetary policy developments, and data pointing to strong growth momentum in the United States."
The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
They saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions.
"Some AFE sovereign yields recovered partially from their post-Brexit lows, but U. K. long-term yields remained low on expectations of slower growth there and further monetary policy accommodation."
"Comparatively warm weather had extended the building season in several areas, while rising incomes and low interest rates had continued to stimulate housing demand."
The risks to the projection for inflation were judged to be roughly balanced.
"Housing demand was expected to remain at a generally high level in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat."
Disposable income was boosted by significant growth in private wages and salaries and by a drop in taxes that was due to the lower final payments and higher refunds associated with last year's tax cut.
"Partly as a consequence, the outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January-February from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter.
"The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indicators--such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales--suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December."
"Over September and October, gasoline prices appeared to have risen only moderately despite a jump in crude oil costs."
"Inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still generally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary."
"The staff's forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 in response to weaker-than-expected incoming data for inflation."
A couple of participants did not believe it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting; these participants suggested that the Committee should maintain the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent until the actual rate of inflation had moved further toward the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective or inflation expectations had increased.
The staff's lower path for interest rates reflected a methodological change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast.
"The recent declines in interest rates had spurred a surge in applications for mortgage refinancing and would limit the upward resets on the rates on outstanding adjustable-rate mortgages, both of which would tend to improve some households' finances."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened significantly in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter.
"Energy prices increased sharply, food prices edged up, and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy rose appreciably."
"In 2010, real GDP growth was expected to pick up to near the rate of potential growth, as the restraints on household and business spending from the financial market tensions were anticipated to begin to ease and the contraction in the housing market to come to an end."
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.
"The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
"It was also noted that the postmeeting statements, rather than the SEP, provide the public with information on the Committee's monetary policy decisions and that it was therefore appropriate for the postmeeting statement to convey the Committee's position on the likely future behavior of the federal funds rate."
"The Committee's statement noted that recent information indicated that overall economic activity continued to expand, partly because of some firming in household spending."
"With economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall."
The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) continued to be very stable at a level equal to the interest rate on excess reserves.
"Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which would reduce labor costs."
"Real economic activity appeared to be growing at a solid pace, buttressed by gains in consumer and business spending, supportive financial conditions, and an improving global economy."
"Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed part of their earlier run-up."
"In light of the CPI data, both total and core PCE price inflation on a 12-month basis appeared to slow a bit in March."
"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
"Even so, real GDP was still estimated to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, as changes in both net exports and federal government purchases appeared likely to have subtracted from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter following large positive contributions in the previous quarter."
"Most participants anticipated that, based on their assessment of the current economic situation and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, these conditions could well be met by the time of the next meeting."
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
A major uncertainty in the economic outlook was the extent to which growth in final demand by households and business firms would provide ongoing support for the expansion as the impetus from inventory investment dissipated.
"Crude oil prices declined somewhat over the intermeeting period, a factor that was likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level in coming months."
"Despite efforts aimed at mitigation, foreclosures continued to add to the already very large inventory of vacant homes, putting downward pressure on home prices and housing construction."
"However, a few participants noted that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessment of the outlook and of the appropriate path for policy."
"However, the importance of resource slack as a factor influencing inflation was debated, and some participants suggested that other variables, such as current and expected rates of economic growth, could be useful indicators of inflation pressures."
"Core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher non-oil import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would increasingly outpace even continued rapid productivity growth."
"Accordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central tendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent."
"The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support."
The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-October remained near historically low levels.
"Some participants expressed the view that the recent increases in payrolls likely reflected, in part, a reversal of the sharp cuts in employment during the recession, a scenario consistent with the weak readings on productivity growth of late."
"Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
Most market interest rates had declined somewhat further over the period after the December 19 meeting.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.
"Increases in these prices largely accounted for the more rapid rise in consumer prices thus far this year, and they likely would continue to add to inflation in the months ahead."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
"Over the longer-term, with house price gains moderating and perhaps greater perceived needs to invest for retirement purposes, the household saving rate was likely to rise gradually."
"A jump in gasoline prices pushed up overall consumer price inflation in June, but core consumer price inflation remained relatively stable in recent months."
"Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
"With the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the economyâs potential for some time, pressures on labor and other resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely would continue to edge lower."
"But these concerns reportedly eased somewhat over subsequent weeks, and the initial move in equity prices was reversed."
"Moreover, it seemed likely that economic activity was in the process of leveling out, and the considerable improvements in financial markets over recent months were likely to lend further support to aggregate demand."
"Recent Canadian data were mixed, with relatively strong employment growth and some weakness in retail sales."
"Participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary policy, and global economic growth prospects."
Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and so weigh on consumer confidence.
"Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures."
"Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
"Auto loans continued to be widely available, and respondents to the October SLOOS indicated that demand for auto loans had strengthened further in the third quarter."
"Against that backdrop, members generally anticipated that the recent increase in oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily, but that subsequently inflation would run at or below the rate that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate."
"However, the Committee would need to pay careful attention to these potential problems as inflation fell further."
The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the waning and eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.
"Business contacts suggested that sentiment was improving, but many firms remained somewhat cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity or gain market share rather than to expand capacity."
"Indeed, one participant recommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the Committee consider ways to use its tools to provide more, not less, accommodation."
"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened in August, and the average deficit for July and August was virtually unchanged from that for the second quarter."
"Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
"Under the terms of the proposal, the interest rate on ON RRPs would remain between 0 and 5 basis points."
"While anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point."
"Most saw the risks to growth as broadly balanced, but many saw the risks as tilted to the downside."
"Those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the Committee's communications regarding normalization, would act to modestly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in short-term interest rates."
"Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system."
Participants generally agreed that the most likely economic outcome would be a gradual pickup in growth with slow progress toward maximum employment.
The staff projected that the expansion of economic activity would slow for a time to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential and then would pick up to a rate more in line with that potential.
"However, others questioned the role of uncertainty about policy as a factor constraining aggregate demand."
Participants exchanged views on the extent to which the decrease in labor force participation over recent years represented cyclical weakness in the labor market that was not adequately captured by the unemployment rate.
"Excluding food and energy, sharp increases in the prices of products and services at earlier stages of processing continued to put upward pressures on business costs and consumer prices."
The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.
A large portion of these asset price changes occurred immediately following the September FOMC announcement.
"Compensation per hour in the business sector rose 2 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, the employment cost index for private workers increased 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in August."
"Broad U. S. equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by investors' expectations of stronger earnings growth and improved risk sentiment, with much of the rally coming after the U. S. elections."
"Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers declined in May and held steady in early June, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey remained stable."
"In contrast, contacts in the agricultural sector reported that farm income continued to experience downward pressure due to low crop prices."
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after slow growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, real GDP would expand at a fairly robust pace over the first half of this year, boosted in part by spending on recovery activities associated with the hurricanes."
Participants' assessments of the risks to the inflation outlook were mixed.
"Over subsequent weeks, however, a reference in the minutes of the August FOMC meeting to the need for ""significant cumulative tightening"" and comments by the Chairman and other FOMC members, which were read as minimizing the likely damping effect on the economy of higher energy prices, led markets to raise their expectations of forthcoming policy tightenings."
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a period of very slow growth associated in large part with very weak business fixed investment and to some extent with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the forecast horizon and move back to a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
"In November, M2 growth picked up slightly from its October rate."
"Recent declines in oil prices, which had boosted household purchasing power, were among the factors likely to underpin consumer spending in coming months; other factors cited as supporting household spending included low interest rates, easing credit standards, and continued gains in employment and income."
"Indicators of household net worth were mixed; home prices moved down in July, while equity prices inched up, on balance, over the intermeeting period."
"Expectations of near-term inflation picked up in October, consistent with the increase in energy prices."
"As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
The members acknowledged that a number of special factors were contributing to the relatively benign inflation climate.
"Yields on longer-term inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased more than those on their nominal counterparts, leaving longer-term inflation compensation lower over the period, and inflation compensation at shorter horizons was little changed."
"Even so, investment spending was likely to be relatively robust over the projection horizon in the context of continuing incentives to hold down production costs in highly competitive markets and to take advantage of falling prices and wider applications for certain types of new equipment, notably computer-related equipment."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-3/4 percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonÂ­energy imports over part of this period."
One participant felt that the Committee should explore ways to calibrate the magnitude of the risks to financial stability so that those considerations could be more fully incorporated into deliberations on monetary policy.
"The largest employment loss occurred in the leisure and hospitality category, an industry particularly hard hit by the storm."
"Despite the sharp net increase in energy prices, real disposable income rose further, with solid gains in June and July."
"For the nation as a whole, participants noted that household spending had been fairly robust before the hurricane, supported by strong advances in income and continuing gains in wealth that reflected in part further large increases in home prices."
The measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices was likewise running somewhat below 2 percent.
"On a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
"In line with these revised expectations for the path of policy, the term structure of interest rates flattened over the intermeeting period, as the two-year Treasury yield ended about unchanged and the ten-year Treasury yield dropped somewhat."
"Most participants viewed the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs, and expected these developments to have little bearing on inflation over the medium run."
The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
"Members noted that inflation had picked up in recent months; however, they also noted that inflation had continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
"Labor market conditions improved a little further, although the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period."
"Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable."
"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
A couple of participants stressed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expectations were also still at low levels.
Most members noted that effective communications from the Committee would help the public understand how monetary policy might respond to incoming data and developments.
"Some noted that recent financial market turbulence provided an important reminder that the ability of central banks to offset the effects of adverse economic shocks might be limited, particularly by the low level of policy interest rates in most advanced economies."
"Those firms connected to the auto, aerospace, and construction industries, for example, reported strong demand."
The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months.
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had remained rapid through early spring.
The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further to 4.
The BEA estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about 1/4 percentage point on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
"Many participants expected that, with significant slack in resource markets and longer-term inflation expectations stable, measures of core inflation would remain close to current levels in coming quarters."
"Broad stock price indexes were little changed, on net, since the September FOMC meeting."
"Part of the pickup resulted from a step-up in government hiring of census workers, but gains in private employment were very large over the two months."
The nominal U. S. international trade deficit widened in June but narrowed significantly in July.
"Increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged almost 210, 000 per month over the first three months of 2016."
"On the positive side, home mortgage financing remained widely available at low interest rates and was providing important support to household spending."
"Longer-term interest rates were low and supportive of economic growth, while equity prices had risen."
The unemployment rate declined to 8.
"Subsequently, money market futures rates rose substantially, on net, as stronger-than-expected data on spending and on labor markets along with somewhat improved conditions in financial markets appeared to impart greater confidence about prospects for economic activity."
"However, many members saw the outlook for both employment and inflation as unusually uncertain."
"Broad U. S. stock price indexes declined, and option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose."
Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated.
"However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending."
"Since the year 2000, business capital expenditures had been mostly limited to replacement demand for equipment and software and, with nonresidential construction activity displaying pronounced weakness, total business fixed investment had until recently been on a declining trend."
Participants noted that robust competition--including that from foreign producers--and further substantial gains in productivity were helping to contain cost and price pressures.
"In the latter regard, it was suggested that in the context of rising productivity, profits could prove to be stronger than many now expected, with favorable implications for cash flows and in turn investment activity."
Measures of longer-term inflation compensation remained around the middle of their recent elevated range.
Overall consumer price inflation was relatively subdued in recent months.
"Nonetheless, a number of participants suggested that they would need to see further improvement in labor market conditions and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains before beginning policy normalization."
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity would slow in coming quarters to a pace somewhat above that of the economy's estimated potential and would moderate a bit further in 1998.
"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent."
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in October from its third-quarter average.
Some market participants suggested that the Federal Reserve's actions in the fourth quarter to maintain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices.
"Labor market conditions had shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
"Participants indicated, however, that implementing a more accommodative stance of monetary policy at this meeting could be useful in helping offset these factors over time and in achieving the 2 percent inflation objective over the longer run, by helping prevent circumstances of persistent resource slack or a lasting decline in inflation expectations."
"Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee."
"The expansion in the United Kingdom's economy strengthened, likely reflecting a pickup in consumption growth."
"Alternatively, continued low productivity growth for a time might instead lead to slower-than-anticipated growth in household income and business sales, thereby resulting in paths for the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate little different than currently expected."
"In addition, equity prices recorded substantial gains in April and May, reversing a small portion of the prior wealth declines."
"However, market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low, although somewhat higher than early in the year."
"Equity price increases were broad based across major sectors, with technology, financial, and communication services firms outperforming broad indexes."
"Indeed, some price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through the second quarter."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the July 31-August 1 meeting indicated that economic activity increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and that labor market conditions had improved little in recent months.
"Favorable factors in the outlook mentioned by members included an accommodative monetary policy, prospective legislation that would increase an already stimulative fiscal policy, and evidence of a persisting uptrend in productivity that provided enhanced investment opportunities and ongoing support for household incomes."
"Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
A couple of members noted that the outlook for global growth appeared to have brightened and that downside risks from abroad had waned.
"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in April, reflecting a large increase in imports coupled with a slight decline in exports."
"Prospects for legislative action to apply significant fiscal restraint were unclear, even as the expansion became increasingly well established and private demand proved strong and resilient."
Strains in global financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad.
"However, recent data indicated that growth of spending and output was quite sluggish and below the pace many members had anticipated at the time of the previous meeting."
"To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2."
"On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
"For many participants, the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters had changed little, on balance, since the time of the December meeting."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted the slowing in GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but believed that it probably owed in large part to transitory factors and that economic growth would bounce back in the current quarter."
Members nonetheless expressed optimism regarding the prospects for substantial employment gains once business firms were persuaded that a major uptrend in final sales was firmly established.
"The Committee believed that as those uncertainties lifted, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with the ongoing growth in productivity, would provide vital support toward fostering improving economic performance over time."
The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
"However, unit labor costs had accelerated over 2004 owing to a tapering off in productivity growth."
"Committee Policy Action Members noted that information received over the intermeeting period pointed to somewhat stronger economic growth in the third quarter, partly reflecting a reversal of temporary factors that had depressed economic growth in the first half of the year."
"Currency continued to grow briskly, apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for U. S. banknotes."
"Concerning the outlook for inflation, the members continued to see the risks as primarily tilted toward rising inflationary pressures, though they anticipated that further gains in productivity would hold down increases in unit labor costs and prices, at least over the nearer term."
"Members continued to judge that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
Both long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons continued to be elevated.
"In the labor market, total payroll employment increased further in September, but the unemployment rate was still high."
The unemployment rate dipped to 5.
"The labor market had also continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment."
The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
Several participants pointed out that the decline was broadly in line with expectations in light of the tightening in monetary policy and the rapid run-up in home prices and residential construction in recent years.
"In their discussion of financial market developments, participants observed that financial conditions remained supportive of economic growth, with borrowing rates low and stock prices near all-time highs."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
"A strengthening outlook for economic growth in the United States and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation, appeared to boost investor sentiment."
The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in December and was about unchanged in January.
"Additional sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in October, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained above its year-earlier level."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven by an escalation in international trade tensions, growing concerns about the global economic growth outlook, and the prospect of more policy accommodation by central banks."
"Private nonfarm payroll employment registered its fifth consecutive large monthly decrease, with losses widespread across industries."
"For example, a significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflationary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly to unwind and that eventually could have adverse consequences for economic growth."
A few members stressed that the absence of an explicit federal funds rate target would give banks added flexibility in pricing loans and deposits in the current environment of unusually low interest rates.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the March 19-20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the first quarter of this year after the slowdown late last year.
"Households' net worth probably continued to expand as equity prices and home values increased further, and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers during February and early March remained above its average last fall; however, real disposable incomes only edged up, on balance, in December and January."
"Nominal wage growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3."
Recent wage and price developments had been mixed.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate."
"In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for economic activity and inflation, members commented that the incoming information continued to suggest a vigorous expansion but also subdued inflation despite very tight labor markets."
"Sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in September, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained elevated relative to year-earlier readings."
Many participants noted that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyncratic factors.
"Others, though, saw a risk that if resource utilization remained weak for some time, inflation could fall below levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum employment, a development that would pose important policy challenges in light of the already-low level of the Committee's federal funds rate target."
"Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate."
"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"To help prevent inflation expectations from becoming unhinged, both Messrs. Fisher and Plosser felt the Committee should put additional emphasis on its price stability goal at this point, and they believed that another reduction in the funds rate at this meeting could prove costly over the longer run."
"Contacts in the banking sector reported that U. S. banks continued to be willing to extend loans to creditworthy borrowers, but loan demand remained weak and competition for such borrowers was putting pressure on net interest margins."
"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting."
"Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, had increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation."
"However, with inflation still below the Committee's 2 percent objective, it was noted that downside risks to inflation remained and that a moderate undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could help return inflation to 2 percent."
Most members nonetheless continued to view some increase in core price inflation as a definite possibility.
"The run-up in energy prices, as well as an increase in prices of other commodities and imported goods, had boosted both headline and core inflation."
"Participants anticipated that a gradual recovery in U. S. economic activity would begin during the third or fourth quarter of this year as the economy begins to respond to fiscal stimulus, relatively low energy prices, and continuing efforts to stabilize the financial sector and increase the availability of credit."
"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters."
"Participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expectations, including the role of monetary policy, were imperfectly understood."
"However, several participants suggested the possibility of an upward skew to the distribution of inflation outcomes, especially if there were appreciable further declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or in structural productivity growth; already some participants were hearing anecdotal reports from firms of an increased ability to pass cost increases through to product prices, perhaps because of increasing confidence in the outlook for the economic expansion."
"Regarding the agricultural sector, a very wet spring had significantly reduced the percentage of crops in good condition, and declining commodity prices had further reduced expectations for farm income."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Accordingly, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline over time toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
"In this connection, several participants noted that recent monthly readings, notably for CPI inflation, seemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent, while the trimmed mean measure of PCE inflation, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, remained at 2 percent in July."
The staff continued to forecast that inflation would remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
"The Committee updated the statement to indicate that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months and that it had seen further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, pointing specifically to solid job gains and declining unemployment."
"Still, with no signs of stabilization in the housing sector and with financial conditions not yet stabilized, the Committee agreed that downside risks to growth would remain even after this action."
"The average increase over those two months represented sturdy job gains, even after accounting for the likely catch-up in employment following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita."
"Notably, solid job gains and real income growth, along with a high level of household wealth and relatively upbeat consumer sentiment, were expected to support a pickup in consumer spending after its slowdown in the first quarter."
Home prices rose for the fourth consecutive month in April.
A reduction in interest rates would help to mitigate those risks.
Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place substantial restraint on the demand for U. S. exports and to add to the pressures on domestic producers to hold down prices to meet import competition.
"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation slightly higher."
"Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate."
"In the United States, core consumer price inflation remained subdued in July and August, as price increases in housing services moderated and durable goods prices declined."
The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
"Participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step-down."
"Despite continued softness in house prices, household wealth moved markedly higher in the second quarter, mostly reflecting rising equity prices."
"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
"Consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of disposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer debt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity holdings would support further increases in consumption."
"These participants suggested variously that the share of external trade in the U. S. economy is relatively small, that the effects of changes in the value of the dollar on net exports are modest, that shifts in the structure of U. S. trade and production over time may have reduced the effects on U. S. trade of developments like those seen of late, or that the slowdown in external demand would likely prove to be less severe than initially feared."
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in April and May at a faster rate than the average monthly pace during the previous two quarters.
Participants generally agreed that fiscal negotiations could develop in a way that would result in significantly greater drag on economic growth than in their baseline outlook.
Both compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the employment cost index rose 2-1/4 percent over the year ending in the fourth quarter.
Share prices in U. S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period.
"In their discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence in the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, all the members agreed that the latter should continue to express, as it had for every meeting earlier this year, their belief that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation."
"The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
The drop in the value of oil imports reflected a lower price.
"However, staff analysis suggested that the increases were concentrated over the next few years and that long-term inflation expectations were little changed."
"Some survey measures of inflation expectations had edged up in recent months, and longer-term financial market gauges of inflation compensation had climbed."
"This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
"Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
"Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed."
"Accordingly, almost all members agreed to add language indicating the Committee's anticipation, based on its current assessment of additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's longer-run objective."
"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than those on their nominal counterparts, which decreased modestly, on net, over the period."
"The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability. """
"M2 increased strongly in January and February, boosted primarily by heightened demands for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds."
"Participants also discussed the importance of clarifying that the thresholds would not be followed mechanically and that a variety of indicators of labor market conditions and inflation pressures, as well as financial developments, would be taken into account in setting policy."
"In contrast, economic growth in China slowed abruptly after surging late last year."
"On a quarterly average basis, growth of both monetary aggregates picked up somewhat in the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter."
"On net, over these two months, the nominal U. S. international trade deficit widened, as imports rose more than exports."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth so far this year was considerably slower than they had expected."
"Economic growth rebounded strongly from a weak first-quarter pace in Canada, China, and Mexico, supported by improvement in exports."
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"Despite solid economic growth and a strong labor market, inflation pressures remained muted."
Both the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditure chain-linked index indicated that consumer price inflation was moderate during the April-May period.
"In his assessment, this continued high level of monetary policy accommodation could put at risk the achievement of the Committee's long-run policy objectives."
"The first-quarter data from the employment cost index indicated that the strength in the labor market was showing through to a gradual pickup in wage increases, although the signal from other wage measures was less clear."
"The decline suggested that the rise in mortgage rates in recent months had begun to damp construction activity, but indicators of housing demand, such as sales of new and existing homes, remained relatively robust."
"Participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and the implications for the outlook, rather than calendar dates, would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy."
"Rapid growth of M3 over the first half of the year, partly in conjunction with robust expansion of bank credit, placed growth of this aggregate somewhat above the upper bound of its range."
"Several participants pointed to a diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization, to the possibility that the degree of labor market tightness was less than currently estimated, or to lags in the response of inflation to greater resource utilization as plausible explanations for the continued soft readings on inflation."
"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that growth in economic activity rebounded in the second quarter."
"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year."
The increases in energy and other commodity prices over the intermeeting period had led the staff to revise up its forecast for headline PCE inflation during the first half of the year.
"The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that economic activity had weakened further, reflecting slower growth in consumer spending and softening in the labor market, that financial markets remained under considerable stress, and that the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing market contraction were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
"The staff anticipated that relatively rapid increases in energy prices would raise total consumer price inflation above the core rate in the near term, but that this upward pressure would dissipate by 2012."
"In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1999."
"Nominal Treasury yields increased moderately, on net, since the July FOMC meeting, reflecting the slight upward revision in the expected path for the federal funds rate and a rise in global bond yields that was apparently spurred by an increased impression among investors that monetary policy in other advanced economies might be less accommodative than previously expected."
"Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates."
"Recent monthly gains in payroll employment had continued to be small, and the unemployment rate in June remained at an elevated level."
"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued."
"Housing demand remained very weak, however."
Commodity prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier.
"A couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curve-type framework for policymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation."
"With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak."
"Over the 12 months ending in August, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) edged up, while the core CPI increased 1-3/4 percent."
Both industrial production and employment had recorded sizable advances.
Members agreed that their assessments would also take into account actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal.
"In addition, nearly all members judged that it was appropriate to reiterate the expectation that economic conditions--including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
"Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have accelerated in the fourth quarter, supported by a broad-based firming of domestic demand and strong employment gains."
"Several viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside, particularly in light of the still-low level of measures of longer-run inflation expectations and inflation compensation and the likelihood that disinflationary pressures from abroad would persist."
"The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation--the response of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process."
Surveyâbased measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the slowing of GDP growth in the second quarter was generally in line with expectations, reflecting the continued cooling of the housing market, the restraining influence on demand of higher energy prices, and the lagged effects of past increases in interest rates."
He expressed concern that the excessively rapid rates of growth of the monetary and credit aggregates were inconsistent with continued low inflation.
"While the most recent estimate of nonfarm payroll employment showed a smaller monthly gain than earlier in the year, it followed six months in which increases had averaged more than 200, 000."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in September, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5."
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to a substantial moderation in the expansion to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's potential.
"With respect to its objective of maximum employment, the Committee judged that, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished somewhat over the intermeeting period."
"With long-term trends in innovation holding up reasonably well, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, likely would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels, and a projected pickup in foreign economies was seen as providing some support for U. S. exports."
"Reflecting in part continued tightening of lending standards, consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter; however, that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions."
"Total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October and was lower than early in the year."
"The decrease in inflation compensation was most pronounced at shorter horizons, likely reflecting the drop in oil prices."
"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate."
"While the recent rally in domestic financial markets could be viewed as having partially eroded the degree of monetary restraint implemented earlier, real interest rates for private borrowers were still at relatively elevated levels, banking institutions were continuing to report further tightening of their standards and terms for business loans, equity prices had risen only modestly, and the dollar had firmed over recent months."
The employment cost index increased a little more slowly than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period.
"For example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend economic growth later this year were not realized."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic situation and outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
Mr. Parry dissented because he preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target as insurance against continued sluggishness in economic activity and further declines in inflation measures to undesirably low rates.
"Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
"Retail sales increased, spurred by price discounting."
Votes against this action:Mr. Lacker Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to help ensure that core inflation declines to an acceptable rate in coming quarters.
"Long-duration unemployment remained elevated, and the employment-to-population ratio was still at a very low level at the end of the year."
"Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to trend lower in October."
"Labor market conditions continued to improve markedly in July and August, but employment was still below its level at the beginning of the year."
"For 1997 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3."
"Other members indicated that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than anticipated or if inflation pressures appeared to be developing more rapidly than expected as resource utilization tightened, it might become necessary to adjust the Committee's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate."
"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in March but widened in April, leaving the level of the trade deficit in April similar to its average in the first quarter."
"In addition, these participants stressed the need for a policy stanceâpossibly one using enhanced forward guidanceâthat was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that the United States would experience a protracted period of the kind seen abroad in which the economy became mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation, weak economic activity, and near-zero policy rates."
"Looking ahead, the favorable factors affecting consumer spending more generally along with relatively low mortgage interest rates were expected to sustain a high level of housing expenditures this year."
The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.
Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term.
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
"If employment and inflation converged more rapidly toward the Committee's goals than currently expected, the date of liftoff could be earlier, and subsequent increases in the federal funds rate target more rapid, than participants currently anticipated."
"The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance remained elevated in April, and the number of individuals receiving unemployment benefits relative to the size of the labor force reached its highest level since 1982."
The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter indicated that economic expansion remained moderate in the United Kingdom and sluggish in the euro area.
"The demand for housing, associated with continuing gains in jobs and incomes, had remained ebullient despite an appreciable increase in mortgage rates."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1."
"In addition, a number of technical factors reportedly contributed to volatile interest rate moves in mid-October."
"Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were little changed on balance."
"By contrast, economic activity rebounded in Canada."
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"Excluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."
"Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, and the unemployment rate had fallen, but almost all of the members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee's mandate."
"The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
The market-based measures of inflation compensation that had declined earlier were still at low levels.
"In their discussion of financial developments, participants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corporate risk spreads."
"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting."
"Nonetheless, many judged that some degree of labor market slack remained, as evidenced by the low rate of labor force participation, still-elevated involuntary part-time employment, or subdued growth in wages."
Several others suggested that the upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity may have increased.
Nearly all participants reaffirmed the view that a gradual approach to increasing the target range was likely to promote the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
"Although the unemployment rate fell in May, a drop in labor force participation accounted for the decline."
"By contrast, a few participants noted the possibility that a potentially unsustainable fiscal position and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could boost inflation expectations and actual inflation over time."
Consumer price inflation was restrained significantly by declines in energy prices and continued to run below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent.
"Agriculture remained robust, supported in part by strong demand from emerging market economies."
"These included the effects of higher intermediate- and long-term interest rates on interest- sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing, consumer durables, and business fixed investment."
"Measures of labor compensation continued to increase at a modest pace, although faster than consumer prices."
"The Committee noted that it had discussed the range of policy tools that were available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability, and to indicate that those tools, including adjustments to the Committee's securities holdings, would be employed as appropriate."
"With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers increased at a somewhat faster rate during the three months ended in June, reflecting a surge in benefit costs."
"Another participant indicated a preference for reducing reliance on explicit forward guidance in the statement and conveying instead guidance regarding the future stance of monetary policy through other mechanisms, including the SEP."
"Although economic growth was projected to run a bit above the staff's estimate of the economy's potential, the unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into the labor force."
The higher ranges would be more informative for the Congress and the public as to the money growth likely to be associated with the Committee's expected economic outcomes for the period covered by the ranges.
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
"The unusual configuration of already low interest rates and reservations about the strength of the expansion had justified the inclusion of the phrase ""for a considerable period"" in the statement issued in August."
"On balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while corporate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the September FOMC meeting."
"The members recognized that the recovery in credit markets, the rise in equity prices, and the turnaround in some foreign economies could imply that the lower federal funds rate established last fall was no longer entirely appropriate."
"These spreads subsequently declined somewhat in response to a general agreement among euro-area leaders to expand the capacity of the area's backstop funding facility, to extend the maturity of the facility's loans to Greece, and to lower the interest rates on those loans."
"Members generally agreed that if labor markets continued to tighten, cost and price pressures would begin to pick up."
Participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment.
"Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward restraint on core price inflation was expected to persist over the forecast period."
"Retail gasoline prices jumped in the aftermath of the hurricanes, but total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12âmonth percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in September and was lower than early in the year."
"Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-3/4 percent over the same 12-month period, held down in part by falling prices of non-energy imports and the pass-through of declines in energy prices to prices of other goods and services."
"In their discussion of developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative: The rise in interest rates and appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period had been offset by increases in equity prices, and broader measures continued to point to accommodative financial conditions."
"The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
"Moreover, with margins of resource underutilization having already diminished appreciably and longer-run inflation expectations reasonably stable, most anticipated that tightening resource utilization over the next year would contribute to higher inflation."
The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened in July from its average in the second quarter.
"Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential."
"Most participants described labor market conditions as strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low."
Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.
"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, only edged up over the 12 months ending in April, held down primarily by earlier large declines in energy prices."
Homebuilding was forecast to decline slightly further in response to the previous backup in residential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
"The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
"Consumer spending and business fixed investment were still trending upward strongly, and housing demand was holding at a high level."
The unemployment rate edged up to 4.
"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
"In emerging Asia, the pace of real GDP growth picked up in the fourth quarter in China and South Korea, but it softened in most other countries."
"Several participants stressed the possibility that real GDP growth in the second quarter may have been boosted by transitory factors, including an outsized increase in U. S. exports."
"However, the equity prices of many investment and commercial banks had declined over the intermeeting period, reflecting increased concern about asset quality and the outlook for profits."
He also continued to disagree with the description of the time period over which a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate and exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted.
"Factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic activity included highly accommodative monetary policy, improving credit availability, receding effects of fiscal restraint, continued strength in housing and auto sales, and improvements in household and business balance sheets."
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward pressure on core price inflation was expected over the forecast period."
Headline inflation in the United States was elevated in March.
"A survey measure of the near-term inflation expectations of households had risen notably, but intermediate- and longer-term inflation expectations implied by Treasury security yields had remained fairly stable."
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and further decreases in prices of non-energy imports."
"Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and there would be additional improvements in labor market conditions."
"Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
Market participants characterized the Federal Reserve's monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period as suggesting a slightly more accommodative policy stance than had been expected.
Core consumer price inflation moved down further in the first quarter from its already low level.
Unit labor costs continued to be restrained by weakness in hourly compensation and further gains in productivity.
Participants discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might increase monetary policy accommodation or clarify their intentions regarding policy.
"Light motor vehicle sales maintained a robust pace in June, and indicators of vehicle demand were mixed but generally favorable."
Increases in unit labor costs also could add to inflationary pressures.
Some argued that the rise in core inflation from very low levels reflected the accommodative stance of monetary policy and indicated that the large-scale asset purchases the Committee undertook from November through June had been a successful response to the deflation risks of a year ago.
"In any event, it was clear that forecasts in recent years typically had overstated the rise in inflation, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the extent to which productivity gains and other factors, some unspecified, might continue to hold down inflation in a period of robust economic growth and relatively tight labor markets."
Participants generally saw the news on spending and the labor market over the past few quarters as being consistent with continued above-trend growth and a further strengthening in labor markets.
The option-implied price of insurance against downside risk on the index at longer horizons remained elevated.
"All participants supported enhancing the Committee's guidance on asset purchases at this meeting and, in particular, adopting qualitative, outcome-based guidance indicating that increases in asset holdings would continue, with purchases of Treasury securities of at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS of at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the economic expansion would moderate gradually from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities were changed little, on net, and remained below their early fall 2018 levels."
"The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to temporarily move slightly below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate."
"Increases in foreign economic activity were robust, on average, in the second quarter."
"On balance, the members did not view changes in inflation in either direction as likely to generate significant policy concerns over the forecast horizon."
"Forward measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell despite an appreciable increase in crude oil prices, a development that contrasted with the positive correlation between these variables that had been evident for some time."
"In Canada, indicators suggested that growth in economic activity moderated in the fourth quarter."
Several participants observed that the agricultural sector had been adversely affected by significant declines in crop and livestock prices over the intermeeting period.
"At the producer level, prices for finished goods echoed the pattern of consumer prices: Both total and core finished goods inflation decelerated on a year-over-year basis."
Such an approach would postpone any asset sales until the economic recovery was well established and would maintain short-term interest rates as the Committee's key monetary policy tool.
Most members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low ranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1996 that the Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1995.
"The deficit narrowed in September, however, as imports fell while exports expanded moderately."
"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"Other members, emphasizing the persistently strong growth in economic activity and the unusually high level of labor resource utilization, suggested that additional firming of the stance of policy probably would be necessary to keep inflation in check and hence maintain the favorable backdrop for maximum economic growth."
Some participants offered remarks on general features of some of the monetary policy strategies that they would be discussing and on the relationship between those strategies and the current framework.
The latter probably reflected at least in part increased uncertainty--inflation risk--rather than greater inflation expectations; increases in nominal wages did not appear to be incorporating higher inflation expectations.
"The household saving rate, which had already risen considerably, would eventually level out and cease to hold back consumption growth."
"Mr. Fisher was concerned that an adverse feedback loop was developing by which lowering the funds rate had been pushing down the exchange value of the dollar, contributing to higher commodity and import prices, cutting real spending by businesses and households, and therefore ultimately impairing economic activity."
"The very large equity price increases in recent years evidently had contributed to high levels of consumer confidence and robust consumer spending, and the further gains in those prices thus far this year would continue to bolster spending for a while."
"Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 165, 000 over the period from October to December, a pace that, if it continued, would be expected to increase labor utilization over time."
"Some participants characterized wage pressures as only moderate, although one noted that wage growth was similar to its pace at the peak of the previous economic expansion."
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance."
Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
"Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1."
"Regarding wage growth at the national level, several participants noted a modest increase, but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat further."
"The economic recovery in the euro area appeared to be continuing, and the pace of Japanese economic growth looked to have picked up."
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
Business contacts spoke of spending a great deal of time and expense to attract and retain workers while concomitantly persisting in efforts to improve the productivity of their operations to accommodate burgeoning growth in demand in the face of labor force constraints.
"Employment growth moderated recently, while industrial production continued to rise appreciably."
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised down a little for the second half of this year relative to the previous projection.
"An upward creep in the growth of labor costs was apparent in data on the hourly compensation of private industry workers; although the rise in the first three months of 1997 was smaller than the increase in the fourth quarter, the advance over the twelve months ended in March was larger than that over the previous twelve months."
"Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending--including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth--were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally saw the incoming data and information received from business contacts as consistent with a continued, moderate recovery in economic activity."
Slack resource utilization through 2005 was also expected to help hold down inflation.
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
"The demand for labor weakened further in May, albeit less rapidly than in earlier months."
Consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12âmonth percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through Mayâremained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year.
"Hourly compensation in private industry rose in the first quarter at the same rate as in 2003, but with the pace of productivity advance moderating, unit labor costs moved higher."
"Although uncertainties about the outlook for spending had increased, it appeared that, over time, consumption would probably expand at a moderate pace--perhaps a little below the pace of income growth once the increases in house prices slowed to more historically typical rates."
Growth in exports had provided substantial impetus to overall demand in the second quarter.
"Ms. George dissented out of concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations."
"Indeed, the available evidence suggested that the profits of business concerns generally had continued to increase in the second quarter, implying that productivity had been rising at a pace that exceeded published estimates by a significant margin."
"The recent news on household spending, consumer sentiment, and the housing market was encouraging, and most participants expected that highly accommodative monetary policy would provide support for the recovery in the period ahead."
"Because labor compensation was still increasing at a subdued rate and inflation remained well below 2 percent, some participants judged that a moderate further decline in unemployment would be unlikely to lead to a buildup of unduly strong inflation pressures."
Solid increases in nominal wages and salaries and lower headline inflation led to robust gains in real income over the summer.
"At the same time, the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient high-tech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending, with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity."
"Business fixed investment was advancing, although the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and export growth had weakened."
"However, a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for inflation, seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation, measures of inflation expectations, or wage growth."
"Growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the first quarter, as soft growth in the Canadian economy and weakness in several emerging market economies (EMEs) offset somewhat stronger growth in other advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in China's economy."
"The economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, and participants generally expected GDP growth to slow a bit to around its estimated potential rate in the second half of the year."
"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates."
Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth and with inflation of 2 percent.
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that it should acknowledge the deceleration in economic activity, the small gains in employment, and the slowing in inflation reflected in the economic data over the intermeeting period."
"With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
"Even so, prospective developments in the foreign trade sector were not likely to provide much relief to demand pressures on the U. S. economy."
"In commercial real estate markets, property sales remained tepid, and prices stayed at depressed levels."
"The Canadian economy rebounded from a weak third quarter, but economic expansion in the United Kingdom nearly came to a halt in the fourth quarter, economic activity in the euro area slipped a little, and the Japanese economy recorded a steep drop."
The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the previous projection.
"The number of natural gas and petroleum drilling rigs in operation had moved down, on balance, since September in response to the moderation in energy prices."
"In any case, all participants recognized that inflation expectations are a key determinant of inflation, and that various measures of inflation expectations, although imperfect, needed to be carefully monitored in the current environment."
"This position took account of a staff projection indicating that the debt aggregate was likely to continue to grow at a rate generally in line with the expansion of nominal GDP, although some moderation in private credit demands was anticipated and there were indications that lenders were no longer easing their terms and conditions for granting credit to consumers and businesses."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
The unemployment rate edged up to 4.
"On the more positive side, there were no signs that the pace of productivity gains was currently leveling out and no evidence of rising longer-term inflation expectations."
Money market interest rates suggested that market participants did not anticipate a change in the Committee's target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting but saw a high probability of a 25 basis point increase at the Committee's December meeting.
One implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation above the Committee's objective.
"Finally, a few participants noted that if the large size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet were to lead the public to doubt the Committee's ability to withdraw monetary accommodation when appropriate, the result could be upward pressure on inflation expectations and so on actual inflation."
"Despite the rise in many market interest rates, equity prices rebounded over the period, and most major market indexes reached record highs."
"Beyond 2018, the projection for GDP growth was essentially unrevised."
"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
"The projected path for oil prices was lower, and the trajectory for equity prices was a bit higher."
"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000."
"Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in November and December, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4."
"Core consumer price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of some further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity."
"And, while adjustments in financial markets to low rates had generally been consistent with the usual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism, some members were concerned that keeping monetary policy stimulative for so long might be encouraging increased leverage and excessive risk-taking."
Recent readings on core inflation had been somewhat elevated.
Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment.
"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
"According to survey information, expectations of near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase in energy prices."
The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
"Core consumer price inflation was moderate in recent months, although some signs of pass-through of higher energy costs were evident, especially in transportation services."
"Consistent with that interpretation, participants observed the recent negative readings on the monthly CPI and noted that they anticipated that the 12-month PCE inflation measure would likely run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective for some time."
"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased a bit more than 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in September."
Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained high.
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
"However, they also recognized that, as economic activity recovered and financial conditions normalized, the use of certain policy tools would need to be scaled back, the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves would need to be reduced, and the Committee's policy framework would return to focus on the level of the federal funds rate."
"Consumer price inflation was relatively low, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
"The projected gradual acceleration in economic activity largely reflected the expected waning of the drag from residential investment, although recent readings on sales and inventories of new homes had been interpreted by the staff as suggesting that the ongoing contraction in residential investment would continue for longer than previously expected."
"However, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and part of the decline in unemployment in November was attributable to a drop in labor force participation."
"Broad U. S. stock price indexes rose, on balance, over the intermeeting period, reflecting investor expectations of further monetary policy accommodation and better-than-expected third-quarter earnings news; option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index was little changed."
"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the change in the average fourth-quarter core PCE price index from a year earlier, ranged from 2-1/4 to 3 percent for this year, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and the range and central tendency were 2 to 2-1/4 percent for next year."
Other factors constraining inflation cited by the members included the ample availability of capacity in most industries and the declines that had occurred in non-oil import prices.
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
A symmetrical directive was now felt to be appropriate in light of the Committee's expectation that further easing was not likely to be needed over the months ahead unless ongoing developments pointed to a more substantial decline in the growth of economic activity or further ebbing of inflation than was currently anticipated.
"Nonetheless, the staff expected that much of the recent softness in inflation would be transitory, and thus did not materially change its medium-term projection."
"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
"Although the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid."
"A number of businesses had indicated that they were seeing some improvement in demand and that they had become somewhat more optimistic of late, with some reporting that they were adding to capacity."
"In addition, many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital."
"Regarding expectations for monetary policy, respondents to the Open Market Trading Desk's surveys suggested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the June meeting."
"The twelve-month change in that index stepped down considerably from last year, in part because of softer prices for a variety of energy-intensive and construction-related items."
"Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent, with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent."
The deputy manager also updated the Committee on implementation of the new framework for investment of foreign currency reserves and on a proposal to publish data series on interest rates in the market for general collateral repurchase agreements.
Recent data on orders pointed to further brisk growth in coming months.
"Evidence on core price inflation was mixed; by one measure, it appeared to be increasing very gradually, in part reflecting the indirect effects of higher energy costs, but by another it had remained at a relatively subdued level."
"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision in the description of market-based measures of inflation compensation to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensation."
"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened considerably in July from its June level, with the dollar value of exports retracing part of its extraordinary June increase and the value of imports rising further."
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the stronger-than-expected expansion in overall economic activity in recent months, but for a variety of reasons they anticipated that growth would slow appreciably over the second half of the year to a pace more in line with the growth in the economy's potential."
More recent indicators pointed to a partial rebound in AFE economic growth in the second quarter.
"Inflation continued to run noticeably below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, but participants anticipated that it would move back toward 2 percent over time as the economic recovery strengthened and longer-run inflation expectations remained steady."
"In the subsequent discussion, meeting participants uniformly agreed that price stability provided the best environment for maximizing sustainable economic growth in the long run, but expressed a range of views on whether it would be helpful for the Committee to articulate a specific numerical definition for the Federal Reserve's price-stability objective--either a single figure or a range."
"Participants variously noted a number of factors that were restraining growth, including low levels of household and business confidence, concerns about the durability of the economic recovery, continuing uncertainty about the future tax and regulatory environment, still-weak financial conditions of some households and small businesses, the depressed housing market, and waning fiscal stimulus."
There also was some question as to whether funds extracted from rising home equity values would continue to provide as important a source of financing for purchases of consumer durables as they had for some time unless mortgage interest rates declined from their already low levels.
"Market interest rates generally have declined somewhat since the day before the Committee meeting on May 20, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably further."
"However, the outlook for housing activity over the intermediate to longer term remained fairly promising against the backdrop of relatively low mortgage interest rates and a prospective recovery in overall economic activity that would foster rising employment and incomes."
Other concerns were related to whether the apparent weakness in productivity growth recently would be reversed or continue.
"However, the members emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic expansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater, tightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in worker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added upward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price inflation over time."
"Part of the softness in manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to pandemic-related delays in the motor vehicle industry's model-year changeover, though subdued foreign demand and weaker demand from domestic energy producers were also likely acting to restrain factory output."
