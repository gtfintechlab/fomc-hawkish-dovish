38,"under normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one proposed by john taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3 even with core inflation running below the committee's 2 percent objective, taylor's rule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if the unemployment rate is currently judged to be close to its normal longer-run level and the ""normal"" level of the real federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average.",LABEL_0,0.9877643585205078

49,"as i noted at my press conference after last week's fomc meeting, participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through late 2017 to levels at or somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level, accompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its estimated longer-run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.898032009601593

52,"the median sep estimate of this longer-run normal rate--that is, the long-run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent inflation--stood at 1-3/4 percent in the fomc's recent projections.8 provided that inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of continuing progress toward maximum employment, i therefore expect that a further tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds rate will be warranted.",LABEL_1,0.997952401638031

54,"keeping in mind that the actual course of monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, i see three additional considerations that are relevant.9 the first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the equilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as i anticipate.",LABEL_0,0.9590688347816467

57,"at an extreme, such developments could even amount to a type of ""secular stagnation,"" in which monetary policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal policy.10 such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially uncertain.",LABEL_0,0.9860994219779968

59,international experience therefore counsels caution in removing accommodation until the committee is more confident that aggregate demand will continue to expand in line with its expectations--a view that is also supported by the research literature.11 a second reason for the committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the vicinity of the zero lower bound.,LABEL_0,0.988007128238678
60,"in the event that growth in employment and overall activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent objective, the fomc can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9979431629180908
61,"but if growth was to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates could limit the committee's ability to provide the needed degree of accommodation.",LABEL_0,0.9983767867088318
62,"research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current policy should lean in accommodative direction.12 in effect, such a strategy represents insurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook.",LABEL_0,0.709659993648529
63,"given the modal outlook envisioned in fomc participants' recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few years, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining appreciably.",LABEL_0,0.7506539225578308
64,"consistent with this assessment, almost all fomc participants now view the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see inflation risks as weighted to the downside.",LABEL_0,0.9453966021537781
65,"for example, respondents to the survey of primary dealers in late january thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the funds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13 in addition, both the remarkably low level of long-term government bond yields in advanced economies and the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market participants may hold more pessimistic views than fomc participants concerning the risks to the global outlook.",LABEL_0,0.998920738697052
66,"since long-term yields reflect the market's probability-weighted average of all possible short-term interest rate paths, along with compensating term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in participants' modal sep projections.14 a final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of achieving a prompt return of inflation to the fomc's 2 percent goal, an objective that would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level.",LABEL_0,0.9990550875663757
