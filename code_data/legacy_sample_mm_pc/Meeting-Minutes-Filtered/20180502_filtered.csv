S. technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth."
2,"The rise in nominal U. S. Treasury yields was associated with an increase in inflation compensation that, in turn, seemed to reflect a firming in inflation data as well as a notable rise in crude oil prices."
3,"In large part, this development seemed to reflect a firming in rates on repurchase agreements (repos) that, in turn, had resulted from an increase in Treasury bill issuance and the associated higher demands for repo financing by dealers and others."

23,Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
24,"Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico, China, and some other parts of emerging Asia."
25,"However, incoming data in a number of advanced foreign economies (AFEs)--in particular, real GDP in the United Kingdom--showed somewhat slower growth than market participants were expecting, partly because of transitory factors such as severe weather."
26,"Overall, inflation in most AFEs and EMEs continued to be subdued, increasing in the AFEs in the first quarter on higher energy prices but stepping down some in the EMEs, partly reflecting lower food prices in some Asian economies."
27,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Early in the intermeeting period, uncertainty over trade policy and negative news about the technology sector reportedly contributed to lower prices for risky assets, but these concerns subsequently seemed to recede amid stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports."
28,"Equity prices declined, nominal Treasury yields increased modestly, and market-based measures of inflation compensation ticked up on net."

41,Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for U. S. economic activity prepared for the May FOMC meeting continued to suggest that the economy was expanding at an above-trend pace.
42,"Real GDP growth, which slowed in the first quarter, was expected to pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through 2020."
43,The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
44,"Relative to the forecast prepared for the March meeting, the projection for real GDP growth in 2018 was revised down a little, primarily in response to incoming consumer spending data that were somewhat softer than the staff had expected."
45,"Beyond 2018, the projection for GDP growth was essentially unrevised."
46,"With real GDP rising a little less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was also a touch smaller than in the previous forecast."
47,The near-term projection for consumer price inflation was revised up slightly in response to incoming data on prices.
48,"Beyond the near term, the forecast for inflation was a bit lower than in the previous projection, reflecting the slightly higher unemployment rate in the new forecast."
49,The rates of both total and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017.
50,The staff projected that total PCE inflation would be near the Committee's 2 percent objective over the next several years.
51,Total PCE inflation was expected to run slightly below core inflation in 2019 and 2020 because of a projected decline in energy prices.
52,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
53,The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
54,"On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected."
55,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
56,An upside risk was that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
57,Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
58,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
59,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
60,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth‑quarter pace, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."
61,"On a 12‑month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
62,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
63,"Participants viewed recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook."
64,"Real GDP growth slowed somewhat less in the first quarter than anticipated at the time of the March meeting, and participants expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary."
65,"They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad."
66,"Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
67,"In many Districts, business contacts experienced rising costs of nonlabor inputs, particularly trucking, rail, and shipping rates and prices of steel, aluminum, lumber, and petroleum-based commodities."

70,"Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains, averaging 200, 000 per month."
71,"The unemployment rate was unchanged, but at a level below most estimates of its longer-run normal rate."
72,Both the overall labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved up.
73,"The first-quarter data from the employment cost index indicated that the strength in the labor market was showing through to a gradual pickup in wage increases, although the signal from other wage measures was less clear."
74,"With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or to decline further below, their estimates of its longer‑run normal rate."
75,"The 12-month changes in overall and core PCE prices moved up in March, to 2 percent and 1."
76,Most participants viewed the recent firming in inflation as providing some reassurance that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.
77,Some participants noted that inflation was likely to modestly overshoot 2 percent for a time.
78,"However, several participants suggested that the underlying trend in inflation had changed little, noting that some of the recent increase in inflation may have represented transitory price changes in some categories of health care and financial services, or that various measures of underlying inflation, such as the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, remained relatively stable at levels below 2 percent."
79,"In discussing the outlook for inflation, many participants emphasized that, after an extended period of low inflation, the Committee's longer-run policy objective was to return inflation to its symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustained basis."
80,"Many saw tight resource utilization, the pickup in wage increases and nonlabor input costs, and stable inflation expectations as supporting their projections that inflation would remain near 2 percent over the medium term."
81,"But a few cautioned that, although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up over recent months, in their view these measures, as well as some survey-based measures, remained at levels somewhat below those that would be consistent with an expectation of sustained 2 percent inflation as measured by the PCE price index."
82,"Participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
83,"Some participants saw a risk that, as resource utilization continued to tighten, supply constraints could develop that would intensify upward wage and price pressures, or that financial imbalances could emerge, which could eventually erode the sustainability of the economic expansion."
84,"Alternatively, some participants thought that a strengthening labor market could bring a further increase in labor supply, allowing the unemployment rate to decline further with less upward pressure on wages and prices."
85,"With regard to trade policies, a number of participants viewed the range of possible outcomes for economic activity and inflation to be particularly wide, depending on what actions were taken by the United States and how U."
86,"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, U. S. inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and pass-through of higher energy costs."
87,"With their decline over the intermeeting period, equity prices were about unchanged, on net, since the beginning of the year but were still near their historical highs."
88,"In their consideration of monetary policy over the near term, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
89,"Participants commented that above-trend growth in real GDP in recent quarters, together with somewhat higher recent inflation readings, had increased their confidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would continue to run near the Committee's longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective."
90,"That said, it was noted that it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the Committee's 2 percent objective."
91,"In light of subdued inflation over recent years, a few participants observed that adjustments in the stance of policy should take account of the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations have drifted a bit below levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
92,"Overall, participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis."
93,"With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, all participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the Committee's statutory objectives."
94,These participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and achieving the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.
95,"A few participants commented that recent news on inflation, against a background of continued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth, supported the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move slightly above the Committee's 2 percent objective for a time."
96,It was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee's symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.
97,Meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates.
98,"Participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the flattening of the yield curve, including the expected gradual rise of the federal funds rate, the downward pressure on term premiums from the Federal Reserve's still-large balance sheet as well as asset purchase programs by other central banks, and a reduction in investors' estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate."
99,A few participants noted that such factors could make the slope of the yield curve a less reliable signal of future economic activity.
100,"In light of this, some participants noted it might soon be appropriate to revise the forward-guidance language in the statement indicating that the ""federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run"" or to modify the language stating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
101,"Participants indicated that the Committee, in making policy decisions over the next few years, should conduct policy with the aim of keeping inflation near its longer-run symmetric objective while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
102,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
103,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
104,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly."
105,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
106,"In particular, in March the 12-month percent increase in PCE prices was equal to the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, while the measure excluding food and energy prices was only slightly below 2 percent."
107,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
108,"Consequently, members expected that, with further gradual adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions would remain strong."
109,Members agreed that inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
110,"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent."
111,"They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
112,Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
113,"They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
114,Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal.
115,"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
116,"Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
117,"Recent data suggest that growth of household spending moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly."
118,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent."
119,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
120,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
121,"The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong."
122,"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent."
123,"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
124,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
125,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
126,The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
127,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1-3/4 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2-1/4 percent."
