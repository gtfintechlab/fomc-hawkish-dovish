0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began.
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.
3,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high."
4,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"About 5 million people—more than 40 percent of the unemployed—have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more who say they would like full-time work have been able to find only part-time employment or have stopped looking entirely."
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The conditions now prevailing in the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential.
6,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"A return to broad-based prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn requires stronger economic growth."
7,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that largely reflected swings in energy prices, inflation has remained tame and appears likely to run at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2 percent objective in coming quarters and over the longer term."
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy."
9,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Today the Committee took several steps.
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First, it decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), initiated at the September meeting, at a pace of $40 billion per month."
11,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Second, the Committee decided to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month, after its current program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the year."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and to keep financial conditions accommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation over time is close to our 2 percent objective."
13,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Finally, the Committee today also modified its guidance about future rate policy to provide more information to the public about how it anticipates it will react to evolving economic conditions."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I will return to this change in our communication after discussing our decision to continue asset purchases.
15,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Although the Committee’s announcement today specified the initial monthly pace and composition of asset purchases, it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend on the Committee’s evaluation of incoming information, in two respects."
17,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In assessing the extent of progress, the Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others."
19,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly."
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to assess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks of its asset purchase program."
21,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Federal Reserve’s asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the economy, for example, by helping to keep mortgage rates historically low."
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Committee expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly updating those assessments."
23,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If future evidence suggests that the program’s effectiveness has declined, or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference appropriate."
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of FINAL securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived benefits and costs of the program."
25,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Unlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated with the Committee’s forward guidance about the federal funds rate, which I will discuss in a moment, the criteria the Committee will use to make decisions about the pace and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular, continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market."
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Because we expect to learn more over time about the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases in the current economic context, we believe that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time."
27,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In today’s statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance to clarify how it expects its target for the federal funds rate to depend on future economic developments."
28,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference household and business confidence and spending."
29,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"By tying future monetary policy more FINAL explicitly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public."
30,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The change in the form of the Committee’s forward guidance does not in itself imply any change in the Committee’s expectations about the likely future path of the federal funds rate since the October meeting.
31,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid-2015 and projects that inflation will remain close to 2 percent over that period."
32,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Thus, given the Committee’s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee’s earlier statements that “exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.” Let me emphasize that the 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the Committee’s longer-term objective for unemployment."
33,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Indeed, in the economic projections submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting, the central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment."
35,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC’s longer-term inflation objective of 2 percent.
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the longer term."
37,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee expects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot."
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In this regard, let me make several points."
39,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low-rate policy as likely to be appropriate at least until the specified thresholds are met."
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Reaching one of those thresholds, however, will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation."
41,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6½ percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate."
42,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Ultimately, in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run 2 percent goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level."
43,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions."
44,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation."
45,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable.
46,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected inflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation."
47,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference fluctuations in inflation, such as those induced by short-term variations in the prices of FINAL internationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend."
48,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation."
49,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored."
50,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Finally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information on economic and financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted in a manner consistent with our dual mandate."
51,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s worth noting that the goals of the FOMC’s asset purchases and of its federal funds rate guidance are somewhat different.
52,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum of the economy by fostering more-accommodative financial conditions, while the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information about the future circumstances under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation."
53,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee to end asset purchases, whenever that point is reached, would not be a turn to tighter policy."
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth."
55,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing accommodation through rate increases.
56,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Moreover, as I have discussed today, the decisions to modify the asset purchase program and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria."
57,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In conclusion, the FOMC’s actions today are part of our ongoing efforts to support economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability."
58,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As I have often stressed, however, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can get the U.S. economy fully back on track."
59,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers come together soon to achieve longer-term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies that could derail the ongoing recovery."
60,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I would be happy to answer your questions.
62,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC."
63,STEVE LIESMAN,I guess I have a lot of questions but I’ll just offer up two here.
64,STEVE LIESMAN,Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate?
65,STEVE LIESMAN,What does that achieve?
66,STEVE LIESMAN,"Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from."
67,STEVE LIESMAN,You had to point out in the statement that it’s not substantially different from the calendar dates we set back in October.
68,STEVE LIESMAN,"Do you have to keep doing that from now on to make it clear that—and then just thirdly, I guess I know I said two— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."
69,STEVE LIESMAN,I’m going to forget.
70,STEVE LIESMAN,But then you have another paragraph after that that says it’s not just target it’s something else.
71,STEVE LIESMAN,"So, it’s unclear to me what good these targets are if you have to reference a calendar date, and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it’s not really targets."
72,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, so first, the—as I said—the asset purchases and the rate increases have different objectives."
73,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation."
74,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Two very different objectives.
75,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool."
76,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have—we’ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might create, and we’ll be seeing how—what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve."
77,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, for that reason, as I discussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative at this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward."
78,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy."
79,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so we’ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect."
80,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"With respect to the date, in the transition today, we wanted to make clear that the change in guidance did not—it happens to be the case that it doesn’t change our mid-2015 expectation."
81,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Going forward, we’ll drop the date and rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will be able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontransparent way, so I think that’s beneficial."
82,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Does that cover your—okay.
83,MARCY GORDON,"Mr. Chairman, what prompted the Committee to make the decision at this particular time to specify targets?"
84,MARCY GORDON,"And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compared to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate, closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures?"
85,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s a very good question.
86,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We took the change today after a good bit of discussion.
87,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at our last meeting.
88,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out."
89,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We—while there are different views on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot of agreement that having a more explicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date-based guidance, and therefore, there was a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance."
90,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we do hope that it’ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we’re going to respond going forward.
91,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment—by no means."
92,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer-run objective."
93,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are that inflation will actually remain, despite this threshold of 2½, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward."
94,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so—and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent with our long-standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target."
95,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we—I think both sides of the mandate are well-served here.
96,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There is no real change in policy.
97,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and economic conditions.
98,MARCY GORDON,"Could I ask, also, given that the—your economic projections are all the more important now that you’ve specified these targets, is it difficult to put forward these projections now given the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff?"
99,MARCY GORDON,How sort of plastic are these?
100,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Are you talking about the SEP projections?
101,MARCY GORDON,Yes.
102,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy."
103,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it’s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism."
104,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We saw what happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell, presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff."
105,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, clearly, this is a major risk factor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward."
106,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would suspect and, although the participants don’t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are assuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the entire fiscal cliff."
107,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I think that’s probably the underlying assumption that most people took when they made their projections.
108,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But as you—you’re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I’m sure you would see changes in the forecast."
109,ALISTER BULL,Alister Bull from Reuters.
110,ALISTER BULL,"Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman."
111,ALISTER BULL,"Could you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a month represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy, because you’re now going to be adding a little bit more to the size of balance sheet?"
112,ALISTER BULL,"And also, you know, you’ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases until you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and you’ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you’ve also got this 6½ percent inflation threshold out there as well."
113,ALISTER BULL,"So, could you talk about what sort of evidence you’d see to sort of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases?"
114,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The first part of your question was?
115,ALISTER BULL,Is this an additional stimulus or are you— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
116,ALISTER BULL,"No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in September."
117,ALISTER BULL,You recall in September we expressed dissatisfaction with progress in the labor market.
118,ALISTER BULL,"We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would undertake additional asset purchases or other actions."
119,ALISTER BULL,And that’s what we’ve done today is simply follow through on what we said we would do in September.
120,ALISTER BULL,"I don’t think that we have, relative to last month, I don’t think we have significantly added to accommodation."
121,ALISTER BULL,"The reason is that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues’, that what matters primarily is the mix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet."
122,ALISTER BULL,"So what’s important is the fact that we’re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that’s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se."
123,ALISTER BULL,"So, in my judgment, the amount of stimulus is more or less the same, it’s just being continued."
124,ALISTER BULL,It’s a follow-through from what we saw in September.
125,ALISTER BULL,"In terms of criteria, again, what we’ve done is we’ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a month of purchases."
126,ALISTER BULL,We are prepared to vary that as new information comes in.
127,ALISTER BULL,"For example, if the economy’s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases."
128,ALISTER BULL,"But again, the problem with giving a specific number is that there are multiple criteria on which we make this decision."
129,ALISTER BULL,"We’ll be looking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we’ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy."
130,ALISTER BULL,"For example, I hope it won’t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I’ve said many times, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish."
131,ALISTER BULL,"Likewise, as I said, we’ll also be looking at the efficacy and costs of our program and if, you know, we find, we expect it to be efficacious but if we find that it’s not working as well as we hoped or if the various costs are emerging that we had not anticipated then that would also have to be taken into account as we think about it."
132,ALISTER BULL,"So, we thought it was not constructive because we ourselves don’t know precisely what would define substantial improvement."
133,ALISTER BULL,"But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not emerge, we’ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market."
134,PETER COOK,Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.
135,PETER COOK,"Mr. Chairman, if I could follow up just on your last response there."
136,PETER COOK,"Given the fiscal cliff, is it possible that if the country, if the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we were to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that?"
137,PETER COOK,"And more specifically, you coined the phrase “fiscal cliff,” and I wanted to get your take on whether you still feel it’s the most appropriate language to describe what would happen at the beginning of the year."
138,PETER COOK,"There are some Americans who may be alarmed by the language, some economists say it’s more of a slope."
139,PETER COOK,"Do you still feel it’s appropriate given the circumstances— the contraction, the fiscal contraction, that would come if there is no deal?"
140,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, for the first part of your question if the economy actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO’s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate."
141,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, on the margin, we would try to do what we could."
142,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We would perhaps increase a bit.
143,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff."
144,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point.
145,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On terms of the terminology, well, and people have different preferences about what they want to call things, I think it’s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy."
146,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary, the economy will, I think, go off a cliff."
147,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think that it’s reasonable to be concerned about this.
148,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t buy the idea that a short-term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly.
149,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think it would be costly and, in fact, we’re already seeing costs."
150,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Why is it that consumer confidence dropped so sharply this week?
151,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?
152,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Why is—why are the markets volatile?
153,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Why is business investment at among its weakest levels during the recovery?
154,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the anticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don’t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important."
155,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The most helpful thing that could—that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability, which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also avoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process."
156,JON HILSENRATH,Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.
157,JON HILSENRATH,"Mr. Chairman, I just—I want to try to square up some numbers."
158,JON HILSENRATH,The threshold that you announced today for when rate hikes might start is 6½ percent.
159,JON HILSENRATH,"The Committee’s assessment of the longer-run unemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer-run equilibrium fed funds rate is around 4 percent according to these projections."
160,JON HILSENRATH,"It suggests that when the Fed does start raising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate."
161,JON HILSENRATH,"Is that, specifically, is that the case and, more generally, can you talk about what this framework that you set up today says about the exit strategy that you had laid out some time ago and whether that’s evolving or changing?"
162,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, it’s a good question."
163,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So first of all, we don’t have a precise estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate."
164,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The estimates that were provided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
165,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it could be well less than 6½ percent, so that gives us some time."
166,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"My anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whenever that occurs, would be relatively gradual."
167,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t think we’re looking at a rapid increase.
168,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions."
169,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it’s—the path that we’re basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes an increase in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6½ percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that."
170,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I—what we said in our statement is that we would take a balanced approach.
171,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we may or may not raise rates at that point."
172,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ll look at the situation.
173,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, which I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would be moderate."
174,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,This is consistent—the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today because the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time.
175,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago."
176,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we may have to reconsider the pace or timing of that, but I don’t see any changes that would, you know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit."
177,ZACHARY GOLDFARB,Thank you.
178,ZACHARY GOLDFARB,Zach Goldfarb.
179,ZACHARY GOLDFARB,"I’m going to continue the two question trend and ask—first on the fiscal cliff, it sounds like you would prefer a sensible balance of fiscal consolidation and support for the recovery, but if people in Congress can’t do that in the next two weeks, do you think postponing off this whole consolidation is preferable to going over the cliff?"
180,ZACHARY GOLDFARB,"And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit more color on how you set the thresholds at what they were?"
181,ZACHARY GOLDFARB,"And what the alternatives were, and how you weighed various alternative but similar policies?"
182,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Sure.
183,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing on the fiscal cliff.
184,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I—you know, there’s a problem with kicking the can down the road."
185,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It might avoid some of the short-term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our longer-term fiscal situation and I don’t want to see that."
186,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think for the best—it’s in the best interest of the economy to come to a two-part solution, if you will."
187,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Part one is to modify fiscal policy in a way that doesn’t create enormous headwinds for the recovery in the near term.
188,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And part two is to at least take important steps towards achieving a framework, at least, by which, perhaps through further negotiation, the Congress and the Administration can achieve a sustainable path for fiscal policy."
189,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That—both of these parts are very important.
190,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t think that we can consider these negotiations a success unless both of them happen.
191,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,[Speaker unknown; inaudible remark] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
192,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,No.
193,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think they’re equally important.
194,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the threshold numbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff, both here and at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so-called optimal policy, or in the best policy that we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation."
195,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And when we do that analysis, what we find is that the best interest rate path—as best as we can determine it based on our models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect—has rates remaining low until unemployment drops below 6½ percent."
196,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And it projects if we put in the two—the half of a percentage point above the December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference stability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there."
197,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"FINAL Inflation will stay around 2 percent, which will be consistent with our longer-term objective."
198,ZACH GOLDFARB,[Inaudible Remark] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
199,ZACH GOLDFARB,"If we got important new information about the structure of the economy, it’s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best—this is one of the advantages of this approach over the date-based approach."
200,ZACH GOLDFARB,"If information comes in which says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date."
201,ZACH GOLDFARB,But it doesn’t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation.
202,SCOTT SPOERRY,"Scott Spoerry from CNN, sir."
203,SCOTT SPOERRY,"When you were appearing on 60 Minutes, one of the things that happened was that you visited your old hometown, and you talked a little bit about how the economy had affected people that you grew up with and affected the people down there."
204,SCOTT SPOERRY,There are a lot of just regular people like that who are out on the countryside wondering what really happens to them if we do go over the federal cliff.
205,SCOTT SPOERRY,"Taxes go up, spending goes down."
206,SCOTT SPOERRY,Do they need to look for a recession?
207,SCOTT SPOERRY,"Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think?"
208,SCOTT SPOERRY,"What do people out there really need to worry about and prepare for when it comes to actually going over that fiscal cliff, if the folks in Washington can’t get their act together?"
209,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I come from a part of South Carolina which has been economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so."
210,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, and people are having a hard time there."
211,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I’ve visited there a few times since I became Chairman.
212,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a stronger economy—more jobs—so that folks across the country, including places like the one where I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves."
213,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s extremely important and I think it’s very important that we not just look at the numbers.
214,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It’s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it’s one-tenth or two-tenths."
215,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Every tenth means, you know, many, many people are represented there."
216,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we always try to do that."
217,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I want to—it’s always a delicate balance—you don’t want to scare people.
218,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution, and I certainly hope they will."
219,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment."
220,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And of course, the consequences of that will be felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt."
221,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it’s exceptionally urgent and important that the Congress and the Administration come to a sensible agreement on this issue."
222,SCOTT SPOERRY,"Okay, sir, I had a follow-up, too."
223,SCOTT SPOERRY,I’m not going to ask you whether we’re in a bond bubble.
224,SCOTT SPOERRY,"But obviously, the new guidance that you’ve given in the FOMC statement is going to give a lot more clues to people who own bonds about when they might start lightening up their bond portfolios and changing the composition of what they own."
225,SCOTT SPOERRY,"Was concerns about information about bond prices and things happening in a big hurry, in terms of some sort of a bubble popping—was that a consideration in adding this transparency?"
226,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I wouldn’t say it was an important motivation for adding transparency.
227,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think transparency has a lot of value.
228,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But it is the—it is a fact that this greater clarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave.
229,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As we go forward in time, if the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer-term bond yields to begin to rise."
230,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the more information we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they’ll have about the likely path of bonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment."
231,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I think that’s a positive aspect of this communication.
232,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It—I wouldn’t say it was the major reason.
233,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The major reason is to give the markets and the public more transparency about what’s determining our policy, but that is one potential advantage."
234,ROBIN HARDING,Robin Harding from the Financial Times.
235,ROBIN HARDING,"Mr. Chairman, you said a moment ago that these thresholds are based on an analysis of optimal policy."
236,ROBIN HARDING,"In the optimal policy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, it showed the first rise in interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that."
237,ROBIN HARDING,Is that the policy that the Fed is now following?
238,ROBIN HARDING,"And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory remarks."
239,ROBIN HARDING,"In that case, how will we ever know that the inflation threshold has been hit?"
240,ROBIN HARDING,Thank you.
241,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman Yellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we’ve done."
242,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, we’ve run it for a variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models, and so on, but the general character of that interest rate path, i.e., that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 6½ or a little lower, and then rises relatively slowly, which goes back to the question that was asked earlier, that it doesn’t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is reached."
243,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That is consistent with that kind of analysis, and that’s the type of analysis that was not the only thing we looked at but was informative in our discussion."
244,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You’ll note also in that kind of policy path, of the type that she discussed, that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 2."
245,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of inflation forecast, the—what the Committee will do on a regular basis is include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now."
246,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee’s objective in a longer term."
247,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The intellectual exercise we’ll be doing is asking ourselves if we maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we expect inflation to cross the threshold or reach that level?"
248,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, it’s very important that the public, the media, the markets find our projections credible, obviously."
249,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation—I mentioned some in my opening remarks—outside forecasts, the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera."
250,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that."
251,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But my expectation is that our projections will be broadly consistent with public views, public information, and so I think we can manage the credibility issue."
252,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with."
253,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,"Sir, you’ve articulated more clearly than ever your commitment to reduce unemployment, but you’ve also said that you’re not actually doing anything more to achieve that goal—that you still expect it to be three years away, that you’re disappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor."
254,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,What is the limiting factor?
255,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment?
256,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,What would it take for you to get that?
257,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we took—the question was whether this was something new relative to September, I think September was the date where we did do a substantial increase in accommodation."
258,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"At that point, we announced our dissatisfaction with the state of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn’t improve."
259,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And what we’ve done today is really just following through what we said.
260,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I would say that, you know, looking at it from the perspective of September, that we have, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation."
261,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The reason—one of the considerations though, as I’ve talked about, is that, you know, given that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more—somewhat more complicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate."
262,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You know, there are concerns that I’ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of market functioning."
263,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And the Committee takes these risks very seriously.
264,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And they impose a certain cost on policy that doesn’t exist when you’re dealing only with the federal funds rate.
265,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so what we’re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that there’s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account."
266,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,"Sir, if I can just follow, so these forecasts presumably incorporate the actions taken into account, and so given those actions, it will still be three years until you achieve your goals."
267,BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM,"Is the message to people who are unemployed basically, “We are doing all we can?” Is this the conclusion that, given that balance of factors, this is the most we can expect?"
268,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first of all, again, these—the projections that you’re looking at are based on each individual—this is not a Committee collective projection."
269,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"What they are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy."
270,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, for example, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn’t be doing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well."
271,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it’s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemployment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet."
272,DARREN GERSH,"To just—Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report."
273,DARREN GERSH,"So just following up on that last question, how helpful would it be to see, as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, some near-term stimulus?"
274,DARREN GERSH,The President’s proposed that.
275,DARREN GERSH,"Do you think—how helpful do you think that would be and, I’ll ask my follow up now, whatever happened to your southern accent?"
276,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, on the second one, I’d like to think I’m bilingual."
277,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"When I go home sometimes I—it comes out pretty strongly, but I won’t try to do that here."
278,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I try to be careful, as you know, not to give views on specific tax and spending programs."
279,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think, of course, obviously those are the province of the Administration and Congress."
280,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The attitude I’ve taken has been that, at a minimum, Congress should try to do no harm, that they should try to avoid policies that significantly slow or derail the recovery at this point."
281,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I think that’s the critical thing along with the long-term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path.
282,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, given that basic recommendation, you know, Congress can consider variations."
283,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, if they believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term."
284,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue supportive fiscal policy in the short term while maintaining the credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term."
285,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And that is I think really a question for them and for their staff.
286,KRISTINA PETERSON,Kristina Peterson of Dow Jones.
287,KRISTINA PETERSON,"Looking over the past year or several years, how would you evaluate the Fed’s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it’s connected to the thresholds?"
288,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have had therefore—had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth."
289,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any means, but we’ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment."
290,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And how do you reconcile those two things?
291,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New York Economic Club recently, right before Thanksgiving."
292,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think the reconciliation is that what we’re December 12, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the FINAL underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy."
293,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It has interfered with business creation, with investment, with technological advances, and so on."
294,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.
295,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"At the same time, though, what—of course, what monetary policy influences is not potential growth, not the underlying structural growth."
296,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s for—many other different kinds of policies affect that.
297,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy."
298,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And there, I think we’ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we’ve been much closer there."
299,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I think therefore that we’ve been able to address that somewhat more effectively with quite accommodative policies.
300,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, of course, we have over time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did in September, have added accommodation and we’ve continued—we continue to reassess the outlook."
301,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think it’s only fair to say that economic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very, very difficult."
302,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And what we basically are trying to do is create a plausible scenario which we think is reasonably likely—base policy on that, but we prepared to adjust as new information comes in and as the outlook changes, and inevitably it will."
303,GREG IP,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
304,GREG IP,Greg Ip of the Economist.
305,GREG IP,Economists have long believed that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run.
306,GREG IP,That’s one reason you’ve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.
307,GREG IP,"Can you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to an unemployment threshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view?"
308,GREG IP,"And, if it’s consistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only?"
309,GREG IP,And would the approach that you’re now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?
310,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, it’s entirely consistent with your view, with the point that you made."
311,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So let me just reiterate it.
312,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As we stated, in fact, in our January set of principles, the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run."
313,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’d add a caveat to this.
314,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market."
315,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long-term unemployment rate."
316,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, the long-term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy."
317,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So that being said, what our 6½ percent threshold is is—as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target—what it is is a guidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin."
318,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It could be later than that, but at least by that time, no earlier than that time."
319,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So it’s really more like a reaction function or a Taylor rule, if you will."
320,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t want—I’m—I’ll get—I’m ready to get the phone call from John Taylor.
321,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation."
322,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, what it’s basically doing is saying how our policy will evolve over time as the economy evolves."
323,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It has no implication that we can affect the long-run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 6½ percent."
324,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We think it’s somewhere between 5 and 6 according to our SEP projections.
325,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We are a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful.
326,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I understand your point but I think that it’s—that providing information on unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets, to the public that allows them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve."
327,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,[Speaker unknown; inaudible remark] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
328,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Unless—so long as the inflation condition is met.
329,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s correct.
330,WYATT ANDREWS,"Mr. Chairman, Wyatt Andrews, CBS News."
331,WYATT ANDREWS,I’d like—still like to hear a little bit more about why you made this announcement today specifically tying federal funds and your policy to the 6.5 percent number?
332,WYATT ANDREWS,I’m sure you have some sort of theory about what you hope changes in the economy as a result of this announcement.
333,WYATT ANDREWS,"If so, what is it?"
334,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we think it’s a better form of communication."
335,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We think it’s—by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we’re more transparent about what’s going to determine our policy in the future."
336,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The date-based guidance, it served a purpose."
337,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date-based guidance, and we did change it a couple of times."
338,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But that was a nontransparent process.
339,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Nobody understood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook.
340,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior."
341,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’m not saying it’s the best possible approach, there may be other things we can do in the future."
342,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it’s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and promptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will begin, and therefore, it’ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer."
343,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower longer-term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy."
344,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that has an automatic stabilizer type effect.
345,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It kind of offsets adverse shocks.
346,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s a better form of communication.
347,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting."
348,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so—and frankly, given that it’s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good idea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference."
349,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we decided since we’re ready to go why not make the change earlier and get the benefit earlier."
350,WYATT ANDREWS,"As a quick follow-up, are you—did you see a level of uncertainty in the business community that you hope to solve by this announcement?"
351,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the business community and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned."
352,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it’s pretty consistent with the mid-2015 date-based guidance that we had been providing."
353,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I’m not saying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting, and what we were expecting."
354,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that wasn’t really the issue.
355,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The problem is that, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the better, or for the worse, in the outlook?"
356,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Under the date-based guidance, that would require the Committee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way."
357,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But under this threshold-based guidance, the markets and the business community can make that calculation on their own and adjust that—their estimates of when rates will begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee to give them a date."
358,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we just think it’s a better approach.
359,JOSH ZUMBRUN,"Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun, Bloomberg News."
360,JOSH ZUMBRUN,"By mid-2015, the recovery is going to be nearly six years old."
361,JOSH ZUMBRUN,The average postwar recovery has been a little less than five.
362,JOSH ZUMBRUN,We’re already banking on a very long expansion.
363,JOSH ZUMBRUN,"You expect, by mid-2015, the funds rate is going to be at zero percent, your balance sheet is potentially at $4 trillion."
364,JOSH ZUMBRUN,"If the business cycle runs out of steam and you’re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have a forceful response in that situation?"
365,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep—we’ve innovated quite a bit in the last few years and it’s always possible we could find new ways to provide support for the economy."
366,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it’s certainly true, I’ve—you know, there’s no doubt that with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide additional accommodation is not unlimited and that that’s just a reality and that actually is an argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now."
367,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, it’s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unanticipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the zero bound earlier."
368,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, exactly for those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the—when policy interest rates are close to zero, and the greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that’s an argument for being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition."
369,DONNA BORAK,"Hi, Chairman."
370,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Hi.
371,DONNA BORAK,Donna Borak with American Banker.
372,DONNA BORAK,My question pertains to the Volcker Rule.
373,DONNA BORAK,"Regulators, earlier this year, seemed cautiously optimistic that they’d be able to finalize a rule by the end of the year."
374,DONNA BORAK,"However, that seems a bit unlikely at this point."
375,DONNA BORAK,"And now, as you know, lawmakers are calling for a two-year implementation delay on the rule."
376,DONNA BORAK,"Given the fact that it’s been such a lengthy process, can you tell us where things stand at this point?"
377,DONNA BORAK,How much closer are we to a final rule?
378,DONNA BORAK,Have the agencies been able to work out their differences?
379,DONNA BORAK,"And, if you may, a prediction on when we might actually see a rule."
380,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ve made quite a bit of progress.
381,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It’s a difficult, complex rule, as you know, and we’ve had, I think I recall, 18,000 comments or something like that."
382,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s been a lot to look at.
383,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know, foreign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera."
384,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there’s been a lot of work to do.
385,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There, I think there is quite a bit of agreement, I wouldn’t say a final agreement, but quite a bit of agreement on key points among the regulators, at this juncture."
386,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, of course, if Congress gives us some other instruction, we’ll follow that, but so far, we haven’t received any different instruction."
387,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s our intent to try to get this done early in 2013.
388,PETER BARNES,"Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman."
389,PETER BARNES,"Since your last press conference with us, we’ve had an election."
390,PETER BARNES,"One of the candidates in that election, Governor Romney, said that he would not reappoint you to a third term as Chairman."
391,PETER BARNES,President Obama did not weigh in on the issue but he was—he did win reelection.
392,PETER BARNES,"If the President were to call you and say, “Ben, your country needs your continued stewardship at the Federal Reserve."
393,PETER BARNES,"We need you to stay and finish the job, see this through.” Would you consider it?"
394,PETER BARNES,"Would you do it, and, by chance, have you had any conversations to that effect with the President or anybody on his team?"
395,PETER BARNES,Thank you.
396,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So to answer the last part, no, I haven’t had any conversations."
397,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on."
398,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"From my own perspective, I just, I really don’t have anything to add from the last press conference."
399,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I am very much engaged in these difficult issues that we’re discussing today, and I have not been spending time thinking about my own future."
400,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I don’t really have anything to add there.
401,KEVIN HALL,"Okay, Mr. Chairman."
402,KEVIN HALL,Thank you.
403,KEVIN HALL,"The two questions, taking the Goldfarb rule into effect, one having to do with the CPI, there’s a lot of debate now with the Boehner plan about this chained CPI."
404,KEVIN HALL,As an econ—not as a Fed Chairman but as an economist—is there a logic in going to that?
405,KEVIN HALL,Do you think it’s a move that should be done separate from the politics of it?
406,KEVIN HALL,"And again, with your economist hat, the labor market, you talked about the importance, not looking at the 6.5 percent threshold, but the broader conditions."
407,KEVIN HALL,A big debate—Steve Liesman’s nemesis talks a lot about people being beamed to Mars.
408,KEVIN HALL,"In your mind, what is happening in the job market?"
409,KEVIN HALL,Are we creating jobs?
410,KEVIN HALL,Is that why it’s coming down or is it because people—the degree of discouraged workers?
411,KEVIN HALL,What is your sense of how quickly it’s fallen because of new employment?
412,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the fixed-weight CPI is a technical issue."
413,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The chained CPI is technically better, according to most economists, because it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually consume more effectively."
414,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, whether, you know, whether that’s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that’s ultimately a political decision."
415,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I suppose a rejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients.
416,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, those are the kinds of questions that Congress is going to have to deal with."
417,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Second part of your question was?
418,KEVIN HALL,The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling from— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
419,KEVIN HALL,"Ah, yes."
420,KEVIN HALL,Sorry.
421,KEVIN HALL,New jobs versus people leaving.
422,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Yes.
423,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, you know, you can see the comparison by looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it’s true that part of the decline in unemployment—and indeed all of it in the last reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force."
424,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer-run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women."
425,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So those things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example."
426,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But beyond that downward trend, there’s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force."
427,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that certainly is part of the issue.
428,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, obviously there has been a good bit of job creation."
429,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,You can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll establishment survey.
430,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think there’s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there’s not any question about that."
431,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it’s also the case that many indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long-term unemployed to the number of people who have part-time work who would like full-time work."
432,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on."
433,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it may be that the labor market is even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago."
434,CATHERINE HOLLANDER,"Mr. Chairman, Catherine Hollander from National Journal."
435,CATHERINE HOLLANDER,"How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency?"
436,CATHERINE HOLLANDER,Is there a Wall Street–Washington disconnect?
437,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Interesting question.
438,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I certainly hope that markets won’t have to tank."
439,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I don’t—we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses and households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming to a solution as quickly as possible."
440,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Markets have obviously already responded to some extent, up and down; you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations."
441,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But on the other hand, it’s also true, if you look at the experience, I think the very informative experience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raised."
442,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly to confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the final debates."
443,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s not unusual to see markets being complacent.
444,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, there’s from a market point of view, there are sort of risks in both directions."
445,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities."
446,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, just to reiterate, I don’t think any policymaker, including the Fed, should be responding to markets."
447,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what’s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as well."
448,STEVE BECKNER,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner of Market News International."
449,STEVE BECKNER,"With the federal government borrowing roughly $ credibility of U.S. finances in general, and the credibility of the dollar as the world’s leading currency?"
450,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first of all, just a couple of facts."
451,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The—we’re buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, about half and half, roughly."
452,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’re buying considerably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstanding Treasuries that the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because while our holdings have increased, so has the—obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands."
453,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s not quite evident that there has been such a radical shift there.
454,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You know, we’ve been increasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we’ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure."
455,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support.
456,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce the size of our holdings and—whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future."
457,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So this is, again, only a temporary step."
458,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It would be quite a different matter if we were buying these assets and holding them indefinitely.
459,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That would be monetization.
460,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re not doing that.
461,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We are very clear about our intentions.
462,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think up until now, it seems our credibility has been quite good."
463,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any—there’s no strong evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on."
464,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, this is one of the things that we have to look at."
465,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large balance sheet."
466,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We want to be sure that there’s no misunderstanding, that there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet."
467,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That’s one of the things we have to look at, but as to this point, there just really is no evidence that people are taking it that way."
468,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I guess it’s worth pointing out—of course we’ve been very focused on the United States here, but we’re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet."
469,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Japanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy."
470,GREG ROBB,"Last but not least, Greg Robb, MarketWatch."
471,GREG ROBB,"There seems to be growing evidence that some of the MBS purchases, the impact of the MBS purchases, are that banks are holding on to some of the gains and not passing them on to the borrowers."
472,GREG ROBB,Is there anything you can do about that and are you concerned about that?
473,GREG ROBB,Thank you.
474,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So the question is—just to restate your question—is about the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage-backed securities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that’s the question."
475,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I have to make sure everybody heard it, so you could answer."
476,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Our analysis suggests that it takes time—two points.
477,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The first point is that while we don’t expect a hundred percent pass-through of MBS yields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis—and we’ve had quite a bit of work done on this issue—suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage rates."
478,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit will, or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers."
479,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates."
480,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But one thing that’s perhaps confusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads.
481,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, for example, there are capacity limitations, which are allowing banks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there’s extra costs like concerns about putback risk, for example."
482,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There’s higher g-fees.
483,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So there’s a number of things happening in the economy which will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so that’s unfortunate."
484,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans."
485,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g-fees, for example, are not really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage customers and thereby strengthen the housing market."
