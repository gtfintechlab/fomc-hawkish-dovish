0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down."
4,CHAIR POWELL,We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
5,CHAIR POWELL,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient.
6,CHAIR POWELL,It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
7,CHAIR POWELL,"From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
10,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
11,CHAIR POWELL,"After expanding at a robust 5-1/2 percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports, two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly."
14,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the first three months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic and near five-decade low of 3.6 percent."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Disruptions to supply have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
24,CHAIR POWELL,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
25,CHAIR POWELL,And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well.
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels."
29,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so."
33,CHAIR POWELL,At today’s meeting the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point and stated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.
34,CHAIR POWELL,"We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
35,CHAIR POWELL,We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, there is a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"We will make our decisions meeting by meeting, as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy."
38,CHAIR POWELL,And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
39,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
40,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $60 billion per month."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals, and in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments."
47,CHAIR POWELL,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
49,CHAIR POWELL,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
50,CHAIR POWELL,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
51,CHAIR POWELL,We are highly attentive to inflation risks.
52,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
53,CHAIR POWELL,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
54,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
55,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
56,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.
57,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
58,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
59,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years."
60,NICK TIMIRAOS,And at the bottom end of FOMC participants’ projections for the longer run rate that you submitted in the projection to the last meeting.
61,NICK TIMIRAOS,How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?
62,NICK TIMIRAOS,What does this imply for your inflation forecast?
63,NICK TIMIRAOS,And how has your level of confidence changed with the regard -- with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?
64,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
65,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you're right, 3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it's been in 50 years."
67,CHAIR POWELL,And I would say that I expect and Committee members generally expect that we'll get some additional participation.
68,CHAIR POWELL,So people will be coming back into the labor force.
69,CHAIR POWELL,We've seen that particularly among prime age people.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"And that will, of course tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"I would also expect though, that job creation will slow."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month, in recent months, very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we think with fiscal policy less supportive with monetary policy, less supportive we think that job creation will slow as well."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"But so I would expect those to be relatively limited, because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"Implications for inflation really the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are running high, the highest they've run in quite some time."
78,CHAIR POWELL,And they are one good example of or good illustration really of how tight the labor market really is.
79,CHAIR POWELL,The fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades.
80,CHAIR POWELL,And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.
81,CHAIR POWELL,"So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in we'd like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"And that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with two percent inflation."
83,CHAIR POWELL,That's our expectation.
84,CHAIR POWELL,Your third question was?
85,NICK TIMIRAOS,Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downturn.
86,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would say it this way.
87,CHAIR POWELL,There's a path.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"There's a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market, and have, therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"They're 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11 and a half million vacancies, six million unemployed people."
90,CHAIR POWELL,"So we haven't been in that place on the vacancy, you know, sort of the vacancy unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve."
91,CHAIR POWELL,We haven't been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.
92,CHAIR POWELL,"So in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"And as a result, and they could come down fairly significantly."
94,CHAIR POWELL,And I think put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"And that that would, that would give us a chance to have lower, good to get inflation down, get wages down, and get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially."
96,CHAIR POWELL,So there's a path to that.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, I would say I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will."
98,CHAIR POWELL,I'll give you a couple of reasons for that.
99,CHAIR POWELL,One is households and businesses are in very strong financial shape.
100,CHAIR POWELL,"You're looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets, excess in the sense that they're substantially larger than the prior trend."
101,CHAIR POWELL,Businesses are in good financial shape.
102,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong."
103,CHAIR POWELL,And so it doesn't seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"therefore the economy is strong, and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"So, but I'll say I do expect that this will be very challenging, it's not going to be easy."
106,CHAIR POWELL,"And it may well depend, of course on events that are not in our under our control."
107,CHAIR POWELL,But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome.
108,CHAIR POWELL,And that's what we're going to do.
109,MICHELLE SMITH,Steve.
110,STEVE LIESMAN,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
111,STEVE LIESMAN,"Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman."
112,STEVE LIESMAN,You talked about using 50 basis point rate hikes or the possibility of them in coming meetings.
113,STEVE LIESMAN,Might there be something larger than 50?
114,STEVE LIESMAN,Is 75 or a percentage point possible?
115,STEVE LIESMAN,And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration?
116,STEVE LIESMAN,Why one month should or one meeting should we expect a 50?
117,STEVE LIESMAN,Why something bigger?
118,STEVE LIESMAN,Why something smaller?
119,STEVE LIESMAN,What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening?
120,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
121,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
122,CHAIR POWELL,So 75 basis point increase is not something the committee is actively considering.
123,CHAIR POWELL,What we are doing is we raised 50 basis points today.
124,CHAIR POWELL,"And we said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there's a broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis increases should be on, 50 basis points should be on the table for the next couple of meetings."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"So we're going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we'll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook, as well as to financial conditions."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"And finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"So the test is really just as I laid it out, economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think expectations are that we'll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out."
129,CHAIR POWELL,And not necessarily declining it but we'll see more evidence.
130,CHAIR POWELL,We've seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"We want to know, we'll want to know more than just some evidence."
132,CHAIR POWELL,We'll want to really feel like we're making some progress there.
133,CHAIR POWELL,"And but I mean, I -- we're going to make these decisions, and there'll be a lot more information."
134,CHAIR POWELL,I just think we want to see that information as we get there.
135,CHAIR POWELL,"It's a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance, 60, 90 days in advance."
136,CHAIR POWELL,There are so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we're leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there."
138,STEVE LIESMAN,"I'm sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate towards a lower increase in the in the funds rate?"
139,CHAIR POWELL,"I don't think the one month, one month is not, no."
140,CHAIR POWELL,No.
141,CHAIR POWELL,One month reading would not -- doesn't tell us much.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we'd want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"As I said, we've got two months now where core inflation is, is a little lower, but we're not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort."
144,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think we need to -- we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled."
145,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation, in fact, is under control, and starting to come down."
146,CHAIR POWELL,"But again, it's not like we would stop."
147,CHAIR POWELL,We would just go back to 25 basis point increases.
148,CHAIR POWELL,It'll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.
149,CHAIR POWELL,"But my, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 basis point increases on the table the next two meetings."
150,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
151,MICHELLE SMITH,Let's go to Colby.
152,COLBY SMITH,Thank you.
153,COLBY SMITH,Colby Smith from the Financial Times.
154,COLBY SMITH,"Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed's target at year end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?"
155,COLBY SMITH,And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?
156,CHAIR POWELL,"So, neutral."
157,CHAIR POWELL,"When we talk about the neutral rate, we're really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher, nor slows it down."
158,CHAIR POWELL,So it's a concept really.
159,CHAIR POWELL,It's not something we can identify with any precision.
160,CHAIR POWELL,So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty.
161,CHAIR POWELL,And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of two to three percent.
162,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, that's a longer-run estimate."
163,CHAIR POWELL,That's an estimate for an economy that's at full employment and two percent inflation.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So really the way, really what we're doing is we are -- we're raising rates expeditiously to the -- what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral."
165,CHAIR POWELL,But we know that there's not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.
166,CHAIR POWELL,"So we're going to be looking at financial conditions, right."
167,CHAIR POWELL,Our policy affects financial conditions and financial conditions affect the economy.
168,CHAIR POWELL,So we're going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions.
169,CHAIR POWELL,Are they tightening appropriately?
170,CHAIR POWELL,And then we're going to be looking at the effects on the economy.
171,CHAIR POWELL,And we're going to be making a judgment about whether we've done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.
172,CHAIR POWELL,It's that.
173,CHAIR POWELL,"So if that path happens to evolve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels."
174,CHAIR POWELL,We won't.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"But again, it's it there's a there's a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don't really feel."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, you're going to raise rates, and you're going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"And of course, if higher rates are required then we won't hesitate to deliver them."
178,MICHELLE SMITH,Neil.
179,NEIL IRWIN,Thanks Chair Powell.
180,NEIL IRWIN,Neil Irwin with Axios.
181,NEIL IRWIN,"Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing that -- in areas like workers wage demands, businesses willingness to raise prices?"
182,NEIL IRWIN,Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on inflation?
183,NEIL IRWIN,Thanks.
184,CHAIR POWELL,"We don't really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"I think if you see, look at short term inflation expectations, they're quite elevated."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"And you can look at that and say, well, that's because people expect inflation to come down."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"And in fact, inflation expectations come down fairly sharply."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"Longer term inflation expectations are, have been reasonably stable, but have moved up to but only two levels where they were in 2014, by some measures."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you can look at that."
190,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that's a fair description of the picture.
191,CHAIR POWELL,But it's really about the risks.
192,CHAIR POWELL,We don't see a wage price spiral.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they're doing that, but there have been price shocks."
194,CHAIR POWELL,So I just think it takes you back to the basic point was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal neutral levels.
195,CHAIR POWELL,"And we need to look around and keep going if we don't see that financial conditions have tightened adequately, or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggests that we that we're not where we need to be."
196,CHAIR POWELL,"So again, you don't see those things yet."
197,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say there's no basis for feeling comfortable about that.
198,CHAIR POWELL,It's a risk that we simply can't -- we can't run that risk.
199,CHAIR POWELL,We can't allow a wage price spiral to happen.
200,CHAIR POWELL,And we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.
201,CHAIR POWELL,It's just something that we can't allow to happen.
202,CHAIR POWELL,And so we'll look at it that way.
203,MICHELLE SMITH,Jeanna.
204,JEANNA SMIALEK,Great.
205,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
206,JEANNA SMIALEK,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
207,JEANNA SMIALEK,"You mentioned in the statement, both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China."
208,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side."
209,JEANNA SMIALEK,And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them.
210,JEANNA SMIALEK,I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those?
211,CHAIR POWELL,Well.
212,CHAIR POWELL,So we -- our tools don't really work on supply shocks.
213,CHAIR POWELL,Our tools work on demand.
214,CHAIR POWELL,"And to the extent we can affect really oil prices, or other commodity prices, or food prices and things like that, so we can't affect those."
215,CHAIR POWELL,But there's a job to do on demand.
216,CHAIR POWELL,And that you can see that in the labor market where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers.
217,CHAIR POWELL,And you can see it in the product markets as well.
218,CHAIR POWELL,But I guess I'm just pointing out that a couple of things.
219,CHAIR POWELL,"For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they're likely to both add to headline inflation."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"And people are going to be suffering from that, you know."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"People don't, people almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but even though they don't actually tell us much about the future path."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"So the second thing is that they're both capable of preventing further progress in supply chain, in supply, chains healing."
223,CHAIR POWELL,And so or even making supply chains temporarily worse.
224,CHAIR POWELL,"So they're not, they're going to weigh on the process of supply, of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"So they're in a way there two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days."
226,MICHELLE SMITH,Victoria.
227,VICTORIA GUIDA,Hi.
228,VICTORIA GUIDA,Victoria Guida from Politico.
229,VICTORIA GUIDA,"I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play and inflation."
230,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And I'm just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out."
231,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Does getting back down to your two percent mandate require that the supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said?"
232,VICTORIA GUIDA,Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don't resolve themselves in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be?
233,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I'll just say for now, we're focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there's plenty to be done there."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, if you look at it's essentially almost two to one vacant job vacancies to unemployed people."
235,CHAIR POWELL,There's a lot of excess demand.
236,CHAIR POWELL,They're more than five million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force.
237,CHAIR POWELL,"So there's an imbalance there that will, that we have to do our work on."
238,CHAIR POWELL,A very difficult situation.
239,CHAIR POWELL,"If you can't, you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn't include the commodity price shocks."
240,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we would -- that's one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but would be a very difficult situation."
241,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored."
242,CHAIR POWELL,"And I mean, that's part of our job, too, so we'd be watching that carefully."
243,CHAIR POWELL,And that does -- it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation.
244,MICHELLE SMITH,Howard.
245,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Oh, Howard Schneider with Reuters."
246,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"And thanks, and nice to be back."
247,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,So the two questions.
248,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,One quick one.
249,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,You cited the 1.9 to 1 figure.
250,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"So often now, I got to ask you what would be a good figure there?"
251,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"What would you like to see that come down to, to think that you're in sort of a non-inflationary vacancy to unemployed rate?"
252,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"And secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through a stock market channels?"
253,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year, how are you mapping that into household consumption?"
254,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Have they come down enough?
255,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Do you need another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending?
256,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, so in terms of the vacancy sign unemployment ratio, we don't have a goal in mind."
257,CHAIR POWELL,There's no specific number that we're saying we got to get to that.
258,CHAIR POWELL,It's really you've got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.
259,CHAIR POWELL,"And that depends not only on the level of those things, it also it depends on how well the matching function in the labor markets are working."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"And that also tends to, you know, to help."
262,CHAIR POWELL,So there isn't a specific number.
263,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say we were, you know, I think I think when we got to one to one, in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"But again, we're not shooting for any particular number."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"What we'd like to see is progress, but we're not really looking at that."
266,CHAIR POWELL,"That's not, that's an intermediate variable."
267,CHAIR POWELL,We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.
268,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"You can think of it as, you know, interest sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, they're big models with a lot of, you know, a lot of difference channels that are related to that."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don't we don't focus on any one market, the equity market or the housing market or we focus on financial conditions broadly."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"So we wouldn't be targeting any one market as you suggest for going up or down, or taking a view on whether it's at a good level or a bad level."
273,CHAIR POWELL,"We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions, all the different financial conditions, indexes, for example, which include equity."
274,CHAIR POWELL,"But they also include debt and other many other things, credit spreads things like that too."
275,MICHELLE SMITH,Rachel.
276,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Hi, Chair Powell."
277,RACHEL SIEGEL,Rachel Siegel here from The Washington Post.
278,RACHEL SIEGEL,"To follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of say a 50 basis point rate hikes or multiple hikes?"
279,RACHEL SIEGEL,"How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill, or their rent, or their gas bill?"
280,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thank you.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"So first, the first thing to say is that we understand, and some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation and many aren't."
282,CHAIR POWELL,But it's very unpleasant.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"It's just something people don't, when they experience it, for the first time, you're paying more for the same thing."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"If you're a normal economic person, then you're probably don't have that much extra, you know, to spend."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"And it's immediately hitting, your spending on groceries on, you know, on gasoline, on energy and things like that."
286,CHAIR POWELL,So we understand the pain involved.
287,CHAIR POWELL,So how do you get out of that?
288,CHAIR POWELL,And the -- it's our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant high nature doesn't get entrenched in the economy.
289,CHAIR POWELL,That's what we're here for.
290,CHAIR POWELL,One of the main things we're here for.
291,CHAIR POWELL,Perhaps the most fundamental thing we're here for.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"And the way we do that is we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, out of imbalance, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates, so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that."
294,CHAIR POWELL,So it's not going to be pleasant either.
295,CHAIR POWELL,"But in the end, everyone is better off."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices."
297,CHAIR POWELL,And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.
298,CHAIR POWELL,We'll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.
299,CHAIR POWELL,"We think we have a good chance to do it without significant increase in unemployment or, you know, really sharp slowdown."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"But ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done the sooner the better."
301,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
302,MICHELLE SMITH,Edward.
303,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
304,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business Network.
305,EDWARD LAWRENCE,So you've talked in the past about consumer spending and how that's driving -- drives the economy.
306,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Are you concerned with this high level of inflation that the consumer will stop spending pushing us into and what's the level of your concern pushing us into a recession?
307,CHAIR POWELL,So the economy is doing fairly well.
308,CHAIR POWELL,It's -- we expect growth to be solid this year.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"And even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts."
311,CHAIR POWELL,"So in the labor market, if you look at the labor market for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for wages are moving up and at rates that haven't been seen in quite a long time."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"So it's a very -- it's a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job."
313,CHAIR POWELL,So it's a strong economy and nothing about it suggests that it's close to or vulnerable to a recession.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, of course, given events around the world, and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"Certainly it will not be -- last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic, as I mentioned, growth over five percent."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above two percent."
317,EDWARD LAWRENCE,But we've talked with economists who have advised democrats and republican presidents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"So and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession, without, you know, a severe downturn without materially high, higher unemployment."
319,CHAIR POWELL,And I mentioned the reasons for that.
320,CHAIR POWELL,So I see a strong economy now.
321,CHAIR POWELL,I see a very strong labor market for example.
322,CHAIR POWELL,"Businesses can't find the people to hire, they can't find them."
323,CHAIR POWELL,"So typically in a recession, you would have unemployment."
324,CHAIR POWELL,Now you have surplus demand.
325,CHAIR POWELL,"So there should be room in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work."
326,CHAIR POWELL,The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools.
327,CHAIR POWELL,"We have essentially interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools."
328,CHAIR POWELL,They’re not capable of surgical precision.
329,CHAIR POWELL,So I would agree.
330,CHAIR POWELL,No one thinks this will be easy.
331,CHAIR POWELL,"No one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think there, we've got a good chance to do that."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances, it is to try to achieve it."
333,CHAIR POWELL,So that's what we're doing.
334,CHAIR POWELL,"There are a range of opinions, though, and that's only appropriate."
335,MICHELLE SMITH,Steve Dorsey.
336,STEVE DORSEY,"Thanks, Steve Dorsey, CBS."
337,STEVE DORSEY,"You mentioned earlier just now, fading fiscal policy."
338,STEVE DORSEY,Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation?
339,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it's really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"And we, you know, we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given and we don't evaluate it, we don't, it's not our job, really."
341,CHAIR POWELL,We don't have an oversight function there.
342,CHAIR POWELL,And we look at it as our job to what given all the factors that are happening to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability.
343,CHAIR POWELL,"So if Congress or the administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I'm not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"It's not -- it's really not our role, we need to stay in our lane and do our job."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now we need to focus on [laughs], just focus on doing our job."
347,CHAIR POWELL,And I'll stick to that.
348,CHAIR POWELL,Stick in our lane.
349,MICHELLE SMITH,Steve Matthews.
350,STEVE MATTHEWS,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News.
351,STEVE MATTHEWS,A number of your colleagues have said that rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation.
352,STEVE MATTHEWS,"One, do you agree with that?"
353,STEVE MATTHEWS,"And two, you've recently spoken great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s."
354,STEVE MATTHEWS,"And while it's certainly not your desire, the soft landing is the big hope of everyone, would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?"
355,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it's certainly possible that we'll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.
356,CHAIR POWELL,We can't know that today.
357,CHAIR POWELL,That decision is not in front of us today.
358,CHAIR POWELL,"If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won't hesitate to do it."
359,CHAIR POWELL,"I'll say again, there's no bright line, you know, that you're stepping over."
360,CHAIR POWELL,"You're really looking at what our policy stance is, and what the market is forecasting for."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"You're looking at financial conditions, and how that's affecting the economy and making a judgment."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we won't be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one."
363,CHAIR POWELL,It's much more about a practical application of our policy tools.
364,CHAIR POWELL,And we're absolutely prepared to do that.
365,CHAIR POWELL,It wouldn't hesitate if that's what is taken.
366,CHAIR POWELL,"So I am, of course, who isn't an admirer of Paul Volcker."
367,CHAIR POWELL,I shouldn't be singled out in this respect.
368,CHAIR POWELL,But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.
369,CHAIR POWELL,And I would phrase it this way.
370,CHAIR POWELL,He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.
371,CHAIR POWELL,That's what it was.
372,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn't that he -- it wasn't a particular thing.
373,CHAIR POWELL,"It was that he always did, he always did what he thought was the right thing."
374,CHAIR POWELL,If you read his last autobiography that really comes through.
375,CHAIR POWELL,"So that's the test is, it isn't will we do one particular thing."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, we do see though, we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability the economy doesn't work for anybody, really."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it's really essential, particularly for the labor market."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very longest, longest expansion cycle in our recorded history."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"In the last two, three years, you've had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles."
381,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was, you know, racial wealth and income."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"Not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gap."
383,CHAIR POWELL,So it's a really great thing.
384,CHAIR POWELL,We'd all love to get back to that place.
385,CHAIR POWELL,"But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability."
386,CHAIR POWELL,So we've been -- basically we've been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.
387,CHAIR POWELL,It's not -- this isn't anything like regular business.
388,CHAIR POWELL,"This is we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in since the Depression."
389,CHAIR POWELL,Then we have this outsize response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.
390,CHAIR POWELL,"Then we have inflation, then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half."
391,CHAIR POWELL,And now we have the shutdowns in China.
392,CHAIR POWELL,So it's has been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.
393,CHAIR POWELL,So we have to look through that and look at the economy that's coming out the other side.
394,CHAIR POWELL,"And we need to get, we need to somehow find price stability out of this."
395,CHAIR POWELL,"And it's obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with."
396,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I guess that's how I think about it."
397,MICHELLE SMITH,Chris Rugaber.
398,MICHELLE SMITH,"CHRIS RUGABER: Thank you, Chris Rugaber, and Associated Press."
399,MICHELLE SMITH,"Earlier, you just said that if necessary, I think were the words that you would, or if it if it turned out to be necessary, or you said it's possible that we'll need to move policy to restrictive levels."
400,MICHELLE SMITH,"Given where inflation is, and the hot economy is, or certainly the hot labor market, as you described it, why still the hesitation?"
401,MICHELLE SMITH,"I mean, it shouldn't it be, what else do you need to see in order to determine that?"
402,MICHELLE SMITH,Wouldn't the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point?
403,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"So I didn't, I said, necessary."
405,CHAIR POWELL,I meant to say appropriate.
406,CHAIR POWELL,We're not going to be erecting a high barrier for this.
407,CHAIR POWELL,It's more if we think it's appropriate.
408,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the point is, we're a very long way from neutral now."
409,CHAIR POWELL,We're moving there expeditiously.
410,CHAIR POWELL,And we'll continue to do so.
411,CHAIR POWELL,And we don't have to make -- we can't make that decision really today.
412,CHAIR POWELL,"The decision for about how high to go, will get, will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I expect we'll get there expeditiously, as I've mentioned."
414,CHAIR POWELL,So it's not that we're not -- we don't want to make making that decision today wouldn't really mean anything.
415,CHAIR POWELL,"But I'll say again, if we if we do believe that it's appropriate to go to those levels, we won't hesitate."
416,MICHELLE SMITH,Michael McKee.
417,MICHAEL MCKEE,Mike McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
418,MICHAEL MCKEE,"The balance sheet, why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not start immediately start in the middle of this month say?"
419,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And do you have another, a newer or a better estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?"
420,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And then finally, I'm just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks?"
421,MICHAEL MCKEE,Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?
422,CHAIR POWELL,"So why June 1, it was just pick a date, you know, and that happens to be that happened to be the date that we picked."
423,CHAIR POWELL,It was nothing magic about it.
424,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it's not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time."
425,CHAIR POWELL,We just picked that.
426,CHAIR POWELL,Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month and that's what we're doing.
427,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn't read anything into it.
428,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet."
429,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we, you -- we run these models, and everyone does in this field, and make estimates of what will be the -- how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing?"
430,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, these are very uncertain."
431,CHAIR POWELL,I really can't be any clearer.
432,CHAIR POWELL,There won't be any clearer.
433,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, people estimate that broadly on the path we're on, and this is -- this will be taken, probably too seriously."
434,CHAIR POWELL,"But sort of one quarter percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace."
435,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would just say with very wide uncertainty bands, very wide."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"We don't really know, there are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way."
437,CHAIR POWELL,And some of you may read about that.
438,CHAIR POWELL,That's kind of a mainstream estimate.
439,CHAIR POWELL,We know that it does -- that it is part of returning to more normal and more neutral financial conditions.
440,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"And really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy."
442,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of speaking to the American people.
443,CHAIR POWELL,"So I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us really that that's who we work for, and that it's the -- it's inflation that people are feeling all over the country."
444,CHAIR POWELL,"And it's very important that they know that we know how painful it is, and that we are working hard on fixing it."
445,CHAIR POWELL,I thought it was quite important to do that.
446,CHAIR POWELL,And so that was really the thinking behind that.
447,MICHAEL MCKEE,Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem?
448,CHAIR POWELL,"No, I don't."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"And a good example of why would be that, so in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year."
450,CHAIR POWELL,You saw financial markets reacting.
451,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, very appropriately."
452,CHAIR POWELL,Not to bless any particular day's measure.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"But the way financial markets, you know, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, its monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent."
455,CHAIR POWELL,We've only done two rate increases.
456,CHAIR POWELL,But if you look at financial conditions the two year is at 280 now.
457,CHAIR POWELL,"In September, I think it was at 20 basis points."
458,CHAIR POWELL,And that's all through the economy.
459,CHAIR POWELL,People are feeling those higher rates already.
460,CHAIR POWELL,And we so that is -- that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.
461,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that's -- we want to keep it that way.
462,MICHELLE SMITH,Scott Horsley.
463,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
464,MICHELLE SMITH,Brian Cheung.
465,BRIAN CHEUNG,Hi there.
466,BRIAN CHEUNG,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
467,BRIAN CHEUNG,To expand on Steve's question about Paul Volcker.
468,BRIAN CHEUNG,"There was also a great pain that came with that as well, higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses."
469,BRIAN CHEUNG,I'm wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption.
470,BRIAN CHEUNG,Are you already seeing that.
471,BRIAN CHEUNG,"Is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments."
472,BRIAN CHEUNG,Is that essentially what's happening through this hiking cycle?
473,BRIAN CHEUNG,Thanks.
474,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so as I mentioned, we're -- you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply."
475,CHAIR POWELL,"And what you're seeing as a result of that is prices going up, and at unsustainable levels."
476,CHAIR POWELL,Levels that are not consistent with two percent inflation.
477,CHAIR POWELL,"And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates, and it moves down."
478,CHAIR POWELL,"Interest rates, you know, businesses will invest a little bit less, less consumers will spend a little bit less."
479,CHAIR POWELL,That's how it works.
480,CHAIR POWELL,"But ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us two percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that."
482,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, the big pain is in not dealing over time, is in not dealing with inflation, and allowing it to become entrenched."
483,MICHELLE SMITH,Greg Robb.
484,GREG ROBB,Thank you.
485,GREG ROBB,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
486,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
487,GREG ROBB,"I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about in March the dot plot had, you know, steady look like steady quarter point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to two percent at the end of the year."
488,GREG ROBB,"Now, where it seems like you're much more aggressive."
489,GREG ROBB,So could you talk about the thinking that's behind that?
490,GREG ROBB,Thank you.
491,CHAIR POWELL,"So look, I think you've what you've seen is really, I would say last fall, in the middle of last fall, there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying."
492,CHAIR POWELL,"If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports."
493,CHAIR POWELL,"And inflation had actually come, month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row stayed low."
494,CHAIR POWELL,"And then around the end of October, we got four, three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy."
495,CHAIR POWELL,"And by the way, then with the with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year."
496,CHAIR POWELL,But that hadn't happened yet.
497,CHAIR POWELL,"Anyway, we got an ECI reading, Employment Compensation Index, reading the Friday before the November meeting."
498,CHAIR POWELL,"Then we got a really strong jobs report, then we got a really high CPI report."
499,CHAIR POWELL,And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt.
500,CHAIR POWELL,And we have.
501,CHAIR POWELL,"Ever since then, really, ever since then, we've been adapting."
502,CHAIR POWELL,"We, you know, there were -- the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting."
503,CHAIR POWELL,And that process is going on.
504,CHAIR POWELL,And it's clearly continuing.
505,CHAIR POWELL,"And that's why I say, and I actually mentioned this in at the March meeting that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days because we're in a fast evolving situation."
506,CHAIR POWELL,And that's what's happened.
507,CHAIR POWELL,"You can see unanimous vote today, of course, and I told you the guidance that broad support on the Committee to have 50 basis point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings."
508,CHAIR POWELL,So you're right.
509,CHAIR POWELL,And by the way other forecasters have been doing the same thing.
510,CHAIR POWELL,And it's just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.
511,MICHELLE SMITH,Thanks.
512,MICHELLE SMITH,We'll go to Nancy for the last question.
513,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace."
514,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Chair Powell, I want to ask how you're able to balance your dual mandate, stable prices, and maximum employment, especially when the unemployment rate for black workers is still roughly double roughly twice the rate for white workers."
515,CHAIR POWELL,"So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were, before the pandemic hit."
516,CHAIR POWELL,So that's one thing I would say.
517,CHAIR POWELL,And that's important.
518,CHAIR POWELL,But the bigger point is this.
519,CHAIR POWELL,"I do not at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as an as intention."
520,CHAIR POWELL,"I don't, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance."
521,CHAIR POWELL,You can see that it's -- there's a labor shortage.
522,CHAIR POWELL,There aren't enough people to fill these job openings.
523,CHAIR POWELL,And companies can't hire and wages are moving up at levels that would not over time be consistent with two percent inflation over time.
524,CHAIR POWELL,"And of course, everyone loves to see wages go up."
525,CHAIR POWELL,"And it's a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level."
526,CHAIR POWELL,"Because these wages are to some extent, being eaten up by inflation."
527,CHAIR POWELL,"So what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower income part of the distribution, especially them."
528,CHAIR POWELL,"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too."
529,CHAIR POWELL,That's the good thing.
530,CHAIR POWELL,"As we have, we've had several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that's because it's been a time of low inflation."
531,CHAIR POWELL,And long expansions are good for people and good for the labor market.
532,CHAIR POWELL,So that's the way I think about it.
533,CHAIR POWELL,"I don't -- I think we, you know, our tools work."
534,CHAIR POWELL,We have to think in the in the medium and longer term.
535,CHAIR POWELL,And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support really a sustained period of strong labor market conditions.
536,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks very much.
