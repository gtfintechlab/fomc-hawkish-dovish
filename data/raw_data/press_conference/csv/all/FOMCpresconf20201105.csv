0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
3,CHAIR POWELL,Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time.
4,CHAIR POWELL,Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.
5,CHAIR POWELL,"The reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"The overall rebound in household spending owes, in part, to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Business investment has also picked up.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated."
15,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate declined over the past five months but remained elevated at 7.9 percent as of September.
16,CHAIR POWELL,"November 5, 2020 Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL remain out of work."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
19,CHAIR POWELL,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
20,CHAIR POWELL,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning."
26,CHAIR POWELL,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
27,CHAIR POWELL,Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.
28,CHAIR POWELL,A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on November 5, 2020 having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"As we said in September Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
32,CHAIR POWELL,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
33,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"At this meeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing in supporting the recovery."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency MBS."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve financial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives as well as market functioning and financial stability."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
41,CHAIR POWELL,Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
43,CHAIR POWELL,These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.
44,CHAIR POWELL,"We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
47,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
48,CHAIR POWELL,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
49,CHAIR POWELL,"Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
52,CHAIR POWELL,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
53,CHAIR POWELL,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
54,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes."
55,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
56,CHAIR POWELL,I’d like to mention a couple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary of Economic Projections beginning in December.
57,CHAIR POWELL,"First, we will release the entire package of SEP materials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out."
58,CHAIR POWELL,"Previously, some of these materials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes."
59,CHAIR POWELL,"This step will make more information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions of forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections."
60,CHAIR POWELL,"Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time."
61,CHAIR POWELL,"These changes to the SEP will provide a timely perspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections, thereby highlighting some of the risk-management considerations that are relevant for monetary policy."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
63,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
64,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
65,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
66,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
67,MICHELLE SMITH,Rachel.
68,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Hi, Chair Powell."
69,RACHEL SIEGEL,It’s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
70,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thanks very much for taking my question.
71,RACHEL SIEGEL,"I’m wondering if you can speak specifically about what indicators you’re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including in the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we’ve seen going into flu season."
72,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thank you.
73,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course."
75,CHAIR POWELL,Let’s start with February.
76,CHAIR POWELL,"In February, we had an economy that was performing well."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in November 5, 2020 activity in March and April, and then we had a record bounceback in May and June."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"And so as I Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and June has now moderated, so it’s not unexpected."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"And they’re certainly still very large, but they’ve—but the pace of improvement has moderated."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market, rather."
82,CHAIR POWELL,Another would be claims.
83,CHAIR POWELL,Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people—a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate."
85,CHAIR POWELL,Same thing with economic activity.
86,CHAIR POWELL,"Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in a sense, that would be—that would be as expected."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are—which are really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households will run through the savings they’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace."
90,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
91,MICHELLE SMITH,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press."
92,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,Thank you.
93,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Could you talk a little bit about where you think the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January?"
94,CHAIR POWELL,"So it is—obviously, it’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ve seen so far, which November 5, 2020 has generally exceeded expectations."
95,CHAIR POWELL,And I do think it’s likely that further support is likely to be Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL needed for monetary policy and fiscal policy.
96,CHAIR POWELL,"I just mentioned the two risks that I think we, we face, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy."
97,CHAIR POWELL,"One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people’s balance sheets that will dwindle."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"But I, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that."
99,MICHELLE SMITH,Nick Timiraos.
100,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
101,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
102,NICK TIMIRAOS,"To follow on Marty’s question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on the fiscal policy front, and yet we don’t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the summer to additional spending."
103,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Two questions: Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates?"
104,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thank you.
105,CHAIR POWELL,"So on your first question, you know, we’ll take into account all external factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals."
106,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we will do.
107,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve said this in the very beginning: It’s really, first and foremost, health-care policy, getting the—getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting—so that—those are absolutely critical to the economy."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, those are important, as well as health policies."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re, they’re going to be critical to the November 5, 2020 economy."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"Fiscal policy can do what we can’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL are out of work through no fault of their own."
112,CHAIR POWELL,"And then we—what we can do is, we can obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can support demand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors."
114,CHAIR POWELL,So I think all of us lived through the experience of the—of the years after the Global Financial Crisis.
115,CHAIR POWELL,"And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight."
116,CHAIR POWELL,And.
117,CHAIR POWELL,"and I think I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’s appropriate, you know, when it’s appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate."
118,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think that that will likely—and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be something."
119,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
120,MICHELLE SMITH,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
121,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
122,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing."
123,STEVE LIESMAN,"The first is, if the market is functioning better, as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for smooth market functioning, why haven’t you reduced QE that you’re doing if the market is functioning better already?"
124,STEVE LIESMAN,"The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy, would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don’t seem to be rising even above 1 percent?"
125,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
126,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support for economic activity."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis, November 5, 2020 the main focus was, obviously, financial, financial market function, particularly in, in, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL some of the major markets."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"But after that period, we’ve, we’ve understood all along that our purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important."
129,CHAIR POWELL,And that need hasn’t dwindled at all.
130,CHAIR POWELL,"So, so we haven’t looked at reducing purchases."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, they’re sustaining the gains we’ve made in financial stability."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don’t—we don’t take anything for granted."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we don’t expect that things will deteriorate."
135,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while."
136,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large."
137,CHAIR POWELL,So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month."
139,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good."
142,CHAIR POWELL,"And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues."
144,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
145,MICHELLE SMITH,"Craig Torres, Bloomberg."
146,CRAIG TORRES,"Hi, Chair Powell."
147,CRAIG TORRES,"First, it’s great to see you’re okay."
148,CRAIG TORRES,"Chair Powell, what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment; November 5, 2020 slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?"
149,CRAIG TORRES,"Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I’m wondering, what’s stopping the Federal Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero boundary or that the economy does when we exit this?"
150,CRAIG TORRES,Thanks.
151,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
152,CHAIR POWELL,"So you did—you laid out nicely the, the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy, or “scarring,” as you put it."
153,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic.
154,CHAIR POWELL,"The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back."
156,CHAIR POWELL,Your skills atrophy.
157,CHAIR POWELL,It’s harder to get back in.
158,CHAIR POWELL,"And the record is, if you don’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in."
159,CHAIR POWELL,And that holds down the whole economy.
160,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s, it’s, it’s important."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out."
163,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"Fortunately, for—you know, the economic recovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even, even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that’s so far."
166,CHAIR POWELL,We are a long way from our goals.
167,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re, we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and there are parts of the economy where it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know, the parts of the economy."
169,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, that’s the supply-side damage."
170,CHAIR POWELL,That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about.
171,CHAIR POWELL,"The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort."
172,CHAIR POWELL,"The second—then the second part was to November 5, 2020 provide support when—to the expansion when it came."
173,CHAIR POWELL,"And the third was to avoid longer-run Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL damage to the economy, and that’s, that’s all of these things."
174,CHAIR POWELL,I think we have been vocal.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s very important that—you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know, we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat."
178,MICHELLE SMITH,[Inaudible] JEANNA SMIALEK.
179,MICHELLE SMITH,[Inaudible] —look like and whether you anticipate any consequences if they are not extended?
180,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, thanks."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets."
182,CHAIR POWELL,"So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well."
183,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now we’re just in the process of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"And in terms of the process, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department."
187,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
188,MICHELLE SMITH,David Gura.
189,DAVID GURA,"[Inaudible] IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote—Gita Gopinath wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we’re in a global liquidity trap and November 5, 2020 talked about the limits of monetary policy right now."
190,DAVID GURA,"She said, “Fiscal policy will need to be the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL main game in town.” And it’s been a busy week."
191,DAVID GURA,"I don’t know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent."
192,DAVID GURA,"And I just wonder if you’d agree with her, in principle, that we are in a global liquidity trap, and what the consequences of that would be."
193,DAVID GURA,"We’ve talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy."
194,DAVID GURA,"My second question is, you talk about how you follow the epidemiology."
195,DAVID GURA,"You’re, you’re looking [inaudible]."
196,DAVID GURA,And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [inaudible] Christine Lagarde laying out what the ECB plans to do.
197,DAVID GURA,"As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that she was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe’s in, what can you and your colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you’ve talked about and, and we’ve all feared when it comes to a, a policy response?"
198,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, thanks."
199,CHAIR POWELL,So two questions.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?"
201,CHAIR POWELL,"And the answer to that would be “no,” I don’t think that."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And we do not doubt the power of the things that we’ve already done or the things that we may, may do in the future."
204,CHAIR POWELL,I do think there’s more that can be done.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought, if you look at the facilities and, and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial—financial conditions accommodative, I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that are November 5, 2020 providing very strong support for the economy."
206,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to—we’re going to keep Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL at that.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular—that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economy recovers."
209,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"And the fiscal response was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States."
211,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far.
212,CHAIR POWELL,So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.
213,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, you need health-care policy too."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that?"
216,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
217,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"And even if we don’t have—and I don’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that could weigh on economic activity."
222,CHAIR POWELL,One would expect that it would.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"And the November 5, 2020 economy, you know, seemed to move right through that."
225,CHAIR POWELL,This one seems to be larger and more Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL widespread.
226,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, it’s a risk, is what I would characterize it—I would characterize it as a risk, as I did in my—in my comments."
227,DAVID GURA,"Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the Fed Chairman?"
228,DAVID GURA,"We’ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it at first."
229,DAVID GURA,You talked about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.
230,DAVID GURA,"I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard’s comments, certainly, there’s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do more—I know that you’re limited in what you can say or the degree to which you’d want to advise Congress, but a simple question: Do you feel that you’re being heard?"
231,DAVID GURA,"As you look at the prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy, or could be, are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you’re saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward?"
232,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me—let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we’re, we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they’ve given us."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing that we think about night and day."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way."
235,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I don’t—I think—you know, I, I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not."
236,CHAIR POWELL,"But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case."
237,DAVID GURA,Thank you.
238,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
239,MICHELLE SMITH,"Edward Lawrence, Fox Business."
240,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
241,EDWARD LAWRENCE,So what would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-term securities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also?
242,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"And as a second point onto that, you know, would—if there’s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger buying of more long-term assets or change the asset purchases?"
243,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would put to you.
244,CHAIR POWELL,"I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle of the program."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know, more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering."
247,CHAIR POWELL,And it will just depend on the—on the facts and circumstances.
248,CHAIR POWELL,We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, those various parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion."
250,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
251,MICHELLE SMITH,Victoria Guida.
252,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Chair Powell."
253,VICTORIA GUIDA,Thanks for taking the question.
254,VICTORIA GUIDA,I wanted to ask about climate change.
255,VICTORIA GUIDA,"FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change—climate change, I’m sorry."
256,VICTORIA GUIDA,"What are you all thinking of doing on that front beyond what you’re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the network for greening the financial system?"
257,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
258,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I do think that the public, public will expect and has every right to expect that we—that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks."
259,CHAIR POWELL,"Climate change is, is one of those risks."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s a relatively—the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"And we are, you know, very actively, in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues around the world to try to think about how this can be part of our framework."
262,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re watching what other—what other countries are doing.
263,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re active participants, as you know, in the CG—no, the greening the financial system."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we haven’t, we hadn’t actually formally joined, but we’re there."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re in the working groups, and we’re doing all of that."
266,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re very much working with and monitoring the things other central banks are doing.
267,CHAIR POWELL,"You hear—you know, there’s lots of research going on at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this."
268,CHAIR POWELL,These tend to be longer-term risks.
269,CHAIR POWELL,"But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we take it as our obligation to—you know, to understand these risks and incorporate them into our—into the way we supervise and, and think about the, the overall financial system and the economy."
271,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
272,MICHELLE SMITH,"Howard Schneider, Reuters."
273,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Quick follow-up from Gina’s question: Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it’s necessary, and are you concerned what a lame-duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?"
274,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"And then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are you comfortable now that the tail risk for worst-case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point?"
275,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Are we down, in November 5, 2020 other words, to kind of household-level problems among a large set of households, perhaps, but Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that the financial crisis, double-dip recession sort of scenarios are, are off the table?"
276,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it’s a decision that we’ll make jointly with the Treasury Department."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s, that’s really all I can say today."
279,CHAIR POWELL,That’s all I have for you on that today.
280,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have, have subsided."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"And that—you know, that’s, that’s—what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"But we, we have to—we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint."
284,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t just look at the most likely case.
285,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we ask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situation like this."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the—of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe, look what’s happening here—another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more."
288,CHAIR POWELL,So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this—to this disease.
289,CHAIR POWELL,It hasn’t gone away.
290,CHAIR POWELL,"Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down, hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but—so we’re learning."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"But, I mean, we, we are so—we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think, clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year."
293,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
294,MICHELLE SMITH,"Scott Horsley, NPR."
295,SCOTT HORSLEY,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
296,SCOTT HORSLEY,"Earlier this summer, I know that you formed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the System."
297,SCOTT HORSLEY,I wonder if you can give us an update on how that’s going.
298,SCOTT HORSLEY,"I know there’s been some, some public relations effort."
299,SCOTT HORSLEY,I think October was “Get the Coins Moving” month.
300,SCOTT HORSLEY,Has that—has that problem subsided?
301,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say why it’s such an important—you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it’s a really incredibly important part of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"And I actually just—I just caught up this morning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself."
305,CHAIR POWELL,So very pleased to report that.
306,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
307,MICHELLE SMITH,"James Politi, FT. JAMES POLITI."
308,MICHELLE SMITH,"Thanks very much for the—for the question, Chair Powell."
309,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ve just had a presidential election here in the United States.
310,MICHELLE SMITH,We still don’t know who the winner is.
311,MICHELLE SMITH,Are you concerned that perhaps tensions or uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil?
312,MICHELLE SMITH,"And has the Fed had any discussions, either internally or with the Treasury Department, about responding to that, should it happen?"
313,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"So, at the Fed here, we will, as November 5, 2020 always, continue to do our jobs."
316,CHAIR POWELL,Every day we’ll continue to serve the American people using Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our tools to support the economy during this difficult time.
317,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the—you ask if we had discussions."
318,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world."
319,CHAIR POWELL,We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing.
320,CHAIR POWELL,We talk about risks to the outlook.
321,CHAIR POWELL,We talk about what the right policy response might be.
322,CHAIR POWELL,"And the election comes up in some—you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting."
323,CHAIR POWELL,Not at all.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I’ll just leave it at that."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that."
326,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
327,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
328,MICHELLE SMITH,"Anneken, CNN."
329,ANNEKEN TAPPE,Thank you for taking my question.
330,ANNEKEN TAPPE,"Chairman Powell, can you tell us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reduced last week and why that was done now rather than earlier, seeing that small businesses are still—clearly still—struggling to make the change necessary?"
331,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
332,CHAIR POWELL,"So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans."
333,CHAIR POWELL,"And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that’s the compensation that the banks get."
334,CHAIR POWELL,"And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loan program and do—and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that."
337,CHAIR POWELL,And so we were reluctant.
338,CHAIR POWELL,"We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I got the question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"November 5, 2020 And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay, so what would that look like if we Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL were to redesign the program in a way—what’s the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could move to a lower level?"
343,CHAIR POWELL,"And it—basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that."
344,CHAIR POWELL,We try to be responsive.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow."
346,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll see how much demand will come.
347,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away?"
348,CHAIR POWELL,We tend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"Then you get it started, and you make changes."
351,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ve been willing to make changes.
352,CHAIR POWELL,That’s the most recent set of ones that we’ve done.
353,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, we hope—we hope that it will help some companies, and I guess we’ll find out."
354,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
355,MICHELLE SMITH,Heather.
356,HEATHER SCOTT,"Heather Scott this time, right?"
357,HEATHER SCOTT,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the question."
358,HEATHER SCOTT,You say that you’re—that you’re not out of ammo.
359,HEATHER SCOTT,"So I’m wondering, then, what is the next tool you expect to be able to roll out?"
360,HEATHER SCOTT,Would you consider some sort of credit program for state and local businesses—state and local governments that are facing real budgetary pressures?
361,CHAIR POWELL,"So when I say we’re not out of ammo, I’m looking at, you know, a couple of our tools, mainly."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, the asset purchase program—there’s a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, we like the job it’s doing."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at November 5, 2020 new facilities."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you’d want to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL maybe continue the facilities and, and, and maybe change them and maybe have new ones."
366,CHAIR POWELL,Who knows?
367,CHAIR POWELL,"But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, I think, overall in accomplishing that job."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"So I do think there, there are things that we can do."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"But, remember, we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach, including health-care policy and fiscal policy too."
370,CHAIR POWELL,"So it really is, if you—if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all of government working together."
371,HEATHER SCOTT,If I could just follow up on that quickly.
372,HEATHER SCOTT,"I mean, you spoke [inaudible] about the small business lending program."
373,HEATHER SCOTT,But that has only reached 400—there’s only been 400 loans.
374,HEATHER SCOTT,"When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there’s more that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either for small businesses or for assisting state and local governments?"
375,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
376,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a bunch of programs.
377,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say that the, you know, the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan—I think, unambiguously, has been a big success."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the success—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that—whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot of money, and, and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, and you’re largely back to a normal functioning market."
380,CHAIR POWELL,I think that’s also been a success.
381,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success."
382,CHAIR POWELL,The—Main Street is just—is just a bigger challenge than all of them.
383,CHAIR POWELL,"Reaching out to small and medium-sized businesses through the banking system, which we had to do, is, is quite challenging."
384,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reach smaller companies."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, and they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now."
386,CHAIR POWELL,Companies are not borrowing.
387,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level."
388,CHAIR POWELL,They don’t want to run up their debt.
389,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I—we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"But I—you know, I think we, we are reaching many of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more."
391,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
392,MICHELLE SMITH,"Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg."
393,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Mr. Chairman, there’s a small but growing number of people, including some former Fed economists, who say you should find ways to go beyond your mandate to provide additional support to the economy, which, in essence, would be fiscal support, since it hasn’t come from Congress."
394,MICHAEL MCKEE,One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal securities directly.
395,MICHAEL MCKEE,Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury.
396,MICHAEL MCKEE,Is there any circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified?
397,MICHAEL MCKEE,How closely are you willing to work with Treasury?
398,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I’m going to take your question literally."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy, that’s not something that we would consider."
400,CHAIR POWELL,"So that—what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly."
401,CHAIR POWELL,"No, that’s not something we do."
402,CHAIR POWELL,We have different jobs.
403,CHAIR POWELL,That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"The—you November 5, 2020 know, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL elected, and that’s the way it should be."
405,CHAIR POWELL,There—they have to be responsible to the electorate.
406,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks—all the things we’re assigned to do."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"But we, we, we’re not going to get into financing the government and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’t—it doesn’t actually, as you probably know, doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"We issue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that’s just another form—on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that’s just another obligation."
409,CHAIR POWELL,"You change the—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs."
410,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to.
411,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we’re looking at."
412,MICHAEL MCKEE,"If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state and municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities, providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so we’re, we’re buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that, that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury."
414,CHAIR POWELL,We’re buying municipal securities of up to three years.
415,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law."
416,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, we’re actually doing that now."
417,CHAIR POWELL,"But I, I see—what that is, from our standpoint, is a rare thing that we do under section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken down."
418,CHAIR POWELL,It’s no longer working.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working."
421,CHAIR POWELL,So we only actually have to do a backstop.
422,CHAIR POWELL,"The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn’t do it."
423,CHAIR POWELL,"We did—we’ve done a very small number of, of loans."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again."
425,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what 13(3) is for.
426,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not—that shouldn’t be a permanent thing where we’re just another federal financing agency that’s available to direct credit to—you know, to very worthy borrowers."
427,CHAIR POWELL,That would be more along the lines of a GSE.
428,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not what we do.
429,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when—you know, when—as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we did after the Global Financial Crisis and as we will here when the time comes."
430,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you very much.
431,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
