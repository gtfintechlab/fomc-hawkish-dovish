0,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome."
1,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet."
2,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I will cover the decisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to make decisions in coming meetings.
3,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
4,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."
5,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains."
6,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.
7,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018."
8,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time.
9,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Despite this positive outlook, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the outlook."
10,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly in China and Europe."
11,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States."
12,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Financial conditions tightened considerably late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018.
13,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, while most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution."
14,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent.
15,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In other words, as economic conditions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our policies."
16,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents.
17,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity—an approach that has served policymakers well in the past."
18,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"With that in mind, I’d like to spell out how the Federal Open Market Committee has been thinking about these issues."
19,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job creation, and price stability."
20,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases were uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook.
21,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We therefore said that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the economic outlook.
22,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Today the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last several months warrant a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes."
23,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In particular, our statement today says, “In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.” This change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy."
24,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Like many forecasters, we still see “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near ."
25,CHAIRMAN POWELL,.
26,CHAIRMAN POWELL,.
27,CHAIRMAN POWELL,2 percent” as the likeliest case.
28,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But the crosscurrents I mentioned suggest the risk of a less favorable outlook.
29,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In addition, the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat."
30,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The traditional case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks that arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too-high inflation."
31,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Over the past few months, that risk appears to have diminished."
32,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Inflation readings have been muted, and the recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months."
33,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Further, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been stable, financial market measures of inflation compensation have moved lower."
34,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Similarly, the balance—the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a number of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved closer to historical norms."
35,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy."
36,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Let me now turn to balance sheet normalization.
37,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Over its past three meetings, the FOMC has held in-depth discussions on the final stages of this process."
38,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Today we made some important progress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today’s FOMC statement."
39,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy.
40,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required."
41,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"This is often called a “floor system” or an “abundant reserves system.” Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the implementation note released today, this means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool, is held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve’s administered rates of interest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without managing the supply of reserves actively."
42,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As the minutes of our recent discussions have indicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short-term money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective transmission of those rates to broader financial conditions."
43,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further questions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization.
44,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The decision to retain our current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the ultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not require us to make frequent sizable market interventions."
45,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but we know that this demand in the post-crisis environment is far larger than before."
46,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Higher reserve holdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must now hold.
47,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve demand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago."
48,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The implication is that the normalization of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance sheet, than in previous estimates."
49,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of balance sheet runoff."
50,CHAIRMAN POWELL,This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance sheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual-mandate objectives and avoiding unnecessary market disruption.
51,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings.
52,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented.
53,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Throughout this process we’ve attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we’ve been willing to make changes as we learn more about the process."
54,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The implementation and normalization statement released today is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we might adjust our plans.
55,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The statement makes three points: First, as we’ve long emphasized, the federal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool."
56,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Second, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not hesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments."
57,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"This does not mean that we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted."
58,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Third, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017."
59,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"While the federal funds rate would remain our active tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios, we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy is not sufficient."
60,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including balance sheet policy."
61,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Times of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC policy.
62,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we’re doing it, both regarding the path of rates and also regarding management of the balance sheet."
63,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We believe that this transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability.
64,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Thank you.
65,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’ll be glad to take your questions.
66,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
67,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,So you’ve said many times recently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn’t be so.
68,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,You’ve said recently that policy—the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn’t require that anymore.
69,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Is that still the case?
70,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"If so, how do you justify the removal of the need for some further interest rate increases?"
71,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Basically, are we at neutral now, or does the economy still need accommodation?"
72,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now.
73,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We think our policy stance is appropriate right now.
74,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We do.
75,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We also know that our policy rate is now in the range of the Committee’s estimates of neutral.
76,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we’ll be—again, we think our policy stance is appropriate."
77,HEATHER LONG,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
78,HEATHER LONG,"Last week, the IMF said risks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy."
79,HEATHER LONG,"Can you clarify—does the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the statement about risks being balanced?"
80,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let’s say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown."
81,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we looked at—we look at those, and the way we think of it is that policy—we will use our policy, and we have, to offset risks to the baseline."
82,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we view the baseline as still solid, and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks."
83,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s the way we’re thinking about that now.
84,SAM FLEMING,Thanks.
85,SAM FLEMING,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
86,SAM FLEMING,The Fed has linked its commitment to patience in part to subdued inflation outcomes.
87,SAM FLEMING,"Would you be comfortable with continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target by core inflation?"
88,SAM FLEMING,How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation when determining the next move?
89,SAM FLEMING,Thanks.
90,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is favorable, and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to—these risks—are going to be with us for a while."
91,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We think our stance is appropriate.
92,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We think there’s no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there.
93,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would say that we’ll be looking at a full range of data, and that will include inflation data."
94,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.
95,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are—we’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’t look at—we look at inflation equally on both sides."
96,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I can’t get into specific hypotheticals, but I do believe that we have a symmetric objective, and I believe we’ll act that way."
97,RICHARD MILLER,We learned from the last minutes of the meeting that some of the tweaks you make to the statement have a lot more portent than we thought.
98,RICHARD MILLER,"In light of that, I’m wondering if you can provide us with a “decoder ring” for this statement."
99,RICHARD MILLER,“Adjustments”—does that suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down?
100,RICHARD MILLER,"And when you twin “in light of global economic and financial developments” with “muted inflation pressures,” does that suggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you’ve talked about and inflation moving up before you get off the dime, so to speak, and move?"
101,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Sorry—say again what the first question was?
102,RICHARD MILLER,"First question is, “adjustments”—is that meant to imply the next move is as most likely to be up as down?"
103,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Yes.
104,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’m just going to say that the—it’s going to depend entirely on the data.
105,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re not making a judgment.
106,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t have a strong prior.
107,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We will be—we will patiently wait and let the data clarify.
108,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be with us for a while, and I think we’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to—as they relate to the outlook for the U.S. and that will be an important aspect as well."
109,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Your second question was?
110,RICHARD MILLER,"Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the end of these muted inflation pressures—are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to change this “patient” stance?"
111,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, it’s really hard to speak about generalities."
112,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures—you know, you would want—I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation."
113,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It wouldn’t be the only thing, but it would certainly be important."
114,STEVE LIESMAN,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
115,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss an actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now?"
116,STEVE LIESMAN,"If so, is that under consideration right now, and when might we know?"
117,STEVE LIESMAN,"The second thing is, I have to nail down this thing."
118,STEVE LIESMAN,"You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the “market average” or the “market outlook” for the size of the balance sheet."
119,STEVE LIESMAN,"Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3½ trillion?"
120,STEVE LIESMAN,"And if you’re not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it?"
121,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Okay.
122,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So today I’m here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven’t been made.
123,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we’re talking about the latter thing, which is discussions, and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are."
124,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But so the Committee is—what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct—efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’t put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil."
125,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So there are a lot of pieces to that, and we’ve learned over time that it’s—when making these—when designing these plans, like, for example, the original normalization plan, it’s good to take your time."
126,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Let the best ideas rise to the top.
127,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’re really comfortable with what you’ve got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly.
128,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I don’t want to get ahead of that process today.
129,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But—so we’ve discussed—there are a number of pieces to that puzzle.
130,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are several different pieces to them, and I think they’re coming—and I’m very pleased with the progress that we’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those discussions."
131,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s the first question.
132,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else’s estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today.
133,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are estimates out there, but I’m not at a point today where I’m going to be giving out numbers on that."
134,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But there are estimates, and I think they’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking."
135,STEVE LIESMAN,"So, just to clarify—I’m sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of the runoff?"
136,STEVE LIESMAN,"That sounds like what you said, to me."
137,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Yes, it’s—so, again, we haven’t made any decisions."
138,CHAIRMAN POWELL,There no decisions have been made.
139,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are different pieces of the thing, and that is in the discussion as one of many pieces that is in the discussion."
140,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually."
141,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
142,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
143,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chairman Powell, I want to follow up on Steve’s question."
144,NICK TIMIRAOS,"The size of the balance sheet obviously matters a great deal, but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was purchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings."
145,NICK TIMIRAOS,"So once you are—once you reach the terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, it will matter a great deal, of course, where along the curve the Fed resumes those reinvestments."
146,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation that would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing, perhaps, in shorter maturity assets, versus the other approach that was identified in the December meeting minutes, which would be to simply reflect issuance of the outstanding Treasury maturities?"
147,NICK TIMIRAOS,And which approach do you think is more appropriate in the current environment?
148,CHAIRMAN POWELL,These are great questions.
149,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one, and it’s one that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings."
150,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It won’t be the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve."
151,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We had discussions at one of the last two meetings on this, and we haven’t come to a judgment on that."
152,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, I wouldn’t comment beyond saying that we understand that’s a key question, and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided."
153,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are benefits and costs to doing—to taking different approaches, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge them today."
154,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"Binya Appelbaum, New York Times."
155,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,I am struggling a little bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago.
156,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,You’ve said today that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue raising rates.
157,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks?
158,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,Can you speak specifically to why you’ve moved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates this year to a posture of standing still?
159,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’d point to a couple of things.
160,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will."
161,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The incoming data have shown more of that.
162,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ve seen that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that’s an important—that has important implications for us, and that story has—let’s just say it continues."
163,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, in addition—I mean, I think important—possibly less important now—probably less important now, but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first- quarter GDP."
164,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t know the ultimate resolution of it.
165,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If that’s all there is, and the shutdown is gone and there isn’t another shutdown, then we’ll get most of that back in the second period—second quarter."
166,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So those things—in addition, you know, you have to look back."
167,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter.
168,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And they now have persisted and remain tighter—significantly tighter, let’s say—than they were, and that’s something that we have to take into account as well."
169,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s where we are.
170,MICHAEL MCKEE,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
171,MICHAEL MCKEE,"You said you like to be a plain speaker, so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible."
172,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Is it fair to characterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now—a new regime for the Fed?"
173,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And, if not, can you put a time frame on “patient”?"
174,MICHAEL MCKEE,Does “patient” have some sort of time frame?
175,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And I’m wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got on your December 19th news conference, your later statements—do you feel you’ve put a “Powell put” into the markets?"
176,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, patience—I think we’re going to know in hindsight, because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook."
177,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So that’s going to be—so it’s hard to say, you know, it’s hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it."
178,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions."
179,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I would say this: We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two things."
180,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors."
181,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And what matters for financial conditions is, when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become important for us because they have important macroeconomic implications."
182,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s how we think about it.
183,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we don’t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets."
184,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that’s something that has to play into our thinking."
185,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions, so it’s sort of the essence of what we do."
186,VICTORIA GUIDA,Victoria Guida with Politico.
187,VICTORIA GUIDA,"I just wanted to ask, first of all, about whether the Fed is gathering information about some of the new money laundering information that’s come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any concerns there?"
188,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there’s any kind of timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real-time payments and whether you’re going to build a real-time payment system?"
189,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Right.
190,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, on the first question, I can—we don’t comment on individual investigations or whether they’re happening."
191,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously, and we put them to work when we feel it’s justified."
192,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of real-time payments, it’s something we’re very actively working on."
193,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them."
194,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, the thing is, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups, consumer groups, and we’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of years."
195,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t have plenary authority to just do things, for the most part, in the payment space."
196,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public—public interest groups—and all those groups around the table."
197,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we’ve—I think we’ve played a constructive role in that respect, and I believe that will continue."
198,JIM PUZZANGHERA,Thanks.
199,JIM PUZZANGHERA,Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.
200,JIM PUZZANGHERA,"You and your colleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed not to raise rates—to stop raising rates."
201,JIM PUZZANGHERA,How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president’s demands?
202,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So what we care about—and, really, the only thing we care about at the Fed—is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately."
203,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s very strongly our culture.
204,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the Fed would recognize that description.
205,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we’re always going to do what we think is the right thing.
206,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work.
207,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we’re human."
208,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We make mistakes.
209,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity.
210,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I would want the public to know that, and I would want them to see that in our actions."
211,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business News.
212,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
213,EDWARD LAWRENCE,The long-term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent.
214,EDWARD LAWRENCE,I’ve talked the last year with a number of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next recession.
215,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"You say that’s your first tool, that’s your primary means of adjusting monetary policy."
216,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"So with a larger balance sheet—with a larger balance sheet, could you—how could you handle that next recession, then, with the combination of those two?"
217,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a situation in the future—we hope not, but—we could be in a situation where we’d like to cut rates more than we can effectively, and we hit the zero lower bound."
218,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t think anything like that is in the cards.
219,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Now, there’s no reason to think that it would be."
220,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But as we said in today’s release, if that happens, then we’ll use the full range of our tools, and that includes the balance sheet."
221,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate and forward guidance about the interest rate."
222,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Even if you have a large balance sheet—$4 trillion?
223,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Above $4 trillion?
224,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Yes.
225,CHAIRMAN POWELL,There would be room to do substantially more.
226,DONNA BORAK,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
227,DONNA BORAK,"I just wanted to go back to—you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue."
228,DONNA BORAK,You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data.
229,DONNA BORAK,"I’m wondering, as you guys discussed during this week’s meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of the shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would diminish consumer confidence, have some severe ripple effects?"
230,DONNA BORAK,"Just talking to other folks outside, businesses—clearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain."
231,DONNA BORAK,"I’m just wondering about, for American families that missed two paychecks, how is this going to play out for them for the months to come?"
232,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Right.
233,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So let me give you the economic side of it first—is that, even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that’s the end of it and everyone gets their backpay—except the contractors, I guess, the private-sector contractors, but—some people get their backpay, then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter."
234,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s that.
235,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would say that the—you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go through."
236,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really grateful they did."
237,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we should all be grateful for."
238,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Did that answer both your questions?
239,DONNA BORAK,"Yes, it does."
240,DONNA BORAK,So you don’t see a permanent effect of this shutdown?
241,DONNA BORAK,And I’m just wondering if you’re thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of reaching this point again on February 15?
242,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So would there be a permanent effect?
243,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned, there wouldn’t be if there isn’t another shutdown."
244,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If there were going to be a permanent effect or a lasting effect, let’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States."
245,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That would be the channel.
246,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I think that was something that we and many others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown.
247,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of ideas for not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those, so I think that could be a profitable thing to explore."
248,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Marty Crutsinger, AP."
249,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,The Beige Book that was prepared for this meeting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the tensions there.
250,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting the wording in your statement?
251,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, trade—you sound like you’re an avid reader of the Beige Book, and that’s great—the trade, as you will know, then—trade has been a big feature in the Beige Book for some time now."
252,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The Beige Book is a collection of all of our—of the comments that our Reserve Bank presidents get from their Districts.
253,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s incredibly valuable, because you’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line."
254,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And there have been real concerns about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retaliation and that kind of thing."
255,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s been a concern.
256,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would say the longer-term concern, though, is the negotiations that are going on."
257,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If they linger, then there could be more and more uncertainty, and you worry over time that that could have an effect on business confidence."
258,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China."
259,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So the concern is more a longer—for me—a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could result in sapping business confidence."
260,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Uncertainty is not the friend of business.
261,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
262,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,I want to talk to you about corporate debt.
263,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising interest rates—we’ve had low interest rates for so long—are you contributing to a bubble in corporate debt?
264,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, we did—we’ve called out corporate debt as a risk—more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they’re going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that."
265,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn."
266,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we watch that.
267,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies.
268,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans."
269,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The question is, what is their exposure?"
270,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Do they retain big pieces of the loans?
271,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build up in a pipeline?
272,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we monitor those risks very carefully.
273,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, frankly, the banks monitor them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis."
274,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So it’s a concern.
275,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s something that we’re watching.
276,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Of course, you know, November, December, and January were much slower months for those sorts of things."
277,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, you know, it’ll be something that we’re always paying close attention to."
278,GREG ROBB,"Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch."
279,GREG ROBB,Financial markets have reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference.
280,GREG ROBB,"The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than, like, 500 points."
281,GREG ROBB,"There’s a sense in the market that there’s, you know, what people call the “Powell put” on the markets."
282,GREG ROBB,Are financial markets wrong in that assessment?
283,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I would point to all the continuity here."
284,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we’ve been working on for, frankly, years—the thing we announced today."
285,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And so we’re providing clarity there.
286,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think that’s a constructive thing to do.
287,CHAIRMAN POWELL,My—honestly—only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people—that’s it.
288,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And this situation, I think, calls for patience—I think it does."
289,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And it’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate.
290,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We see these uncertainties, and we see a time when we can afford to—we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch, and that’s what we’re planning to do."
291,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I think it’s the right thing.
292,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I feel strongly that it is.
293,JOHN HELTMAN,"Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year completed its fintech charter."
294,JOHN HELTMAN,And one of the questions around that charter has been whether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system.
295,JOHN HELTMAN,"I’m curious if you think a fintech charter is a good idea in general, and what conditions you think might be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment system."
296,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’m not going to be able to help you much on that.
297,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Those are great questions, and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are looking at."
298,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think we’re open to these ideas, but I don’t have any news for you on that today."
299,STEVE BECKNER,Thank you.
300,STEVE BECKNER,"Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR."
301,STEVE BECKNER,"Mr. Chairman, you’ve echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and elsewhere in the world, but I wonder whether it’s possible that slower growth abroad might actually be beneficial to this country, in some respects, at least—for example, perhaps increasing capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long-term rates in this country, as happened in the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s."
302,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, Steve, it’s certainly possible."
303,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Ultimately, though, you know, a strong global economy is good for us."
304,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We export to these countries.
305,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We trade with these countries.
306,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept coming in stronger and stronger, and that meant the euro was strong, and that supported our exports."
307,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point to an interesting case."
308,MARK HAMRICK,"Chairman Powell, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate."
309,MARK HAMRICK,Thank you.
310,MARK HAMRICK,"As you probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected to surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of World War II."
311,MARK HAMRICK,"First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the Administration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO?"
312,MARK HAMRICK,"And then, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that’s even close to being true?"
313,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, first, it is important—we don’t do fiscal policy."
314,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy, so I’ll limit myself to more high-level comments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government budget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed."
315,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And that is driven principally by the combination of health-care costs—really, due to our health-care delivery system—and the aging of the population."
316,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And there’s no time like now—when the economy is healthy, growing, people are working—to go after that problem."
317,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Ultimately, we will have to."
318,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t have a forecast.
319,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t forecast those things.
320,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I have no reason to doubt CBO’s numbers on this.
321,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I haven’t actually looked at that report, but my general experience with them is that it’s a professional outfit."
322,MARK HAMRICK,"What does that look like, if that really takes place 10 years down the road?"
323,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, first of all, our—the work that we do relates more to the medium term rather than the long term."
324,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And so I don’t see this, in particular, as a threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year."
325,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s more in the longer run, we’ll be spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the things that we really need to be doing for future generations and for our own generation."
326,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So it’s a serious problem, but it’s not a problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today."
327,PAUL KIERNAN,"Hi, Chairman."
328,PAUL KIERNAN,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
329,PAUL KIERNAN,I know where the FOMC participants’ estimates for the long-run interest rate are.
330,PAUL KIERNAN,They’re all above 2½ percent.
331,PAUL KIERNAN,Right now we’re between 2.25 and 2½.
332,PAUL KIERNAN,"So I think a key question right now is, is policy accommodative at this moment?"
333,PAUL KIERNAN,"Are we looking at staying accommodative for some time, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets?"
334,PAUL KIERNAN,Thanks.
335,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 2½ percent, and that’s kind of roughly where we currently are."
336,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And as I’ve said a couple of times, when you get to that range—you know that we can’t directly observe the neutral rate."
337,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We only know it by its works.
338,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that rate might be and let the data speak to us.
339,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we can do that.
340,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re in the range.
341,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are a number of Committee members who are, you know, right around that range."
342,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I think we’re watching to see.
343,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t—I don’t—again, I think that our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy."
344,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s my feeling.
345,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’re going to be watching data to see whether that’s right, and we’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and how the U.S. economy performs this year."
346,VIRGINIE MONTET,Thank you.
347,VIRGINIE MONTET,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
348,VIRGINIE MONTET,"Among the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American expansion would be the prospect of a “hard” Brexit?"
349,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time.
350,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either in the U.K. or in the EU or both."
351,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we have worked with those institutions alongside U.K. and EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes.
352,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we’ve done a lot of work on that, and, generally speaking—again, a lot of work has been done—we have to be humble and say that this is an unprecedented event."
353,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But that’s the financial system aspect of it.
354,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the continental economy and certainly to the U.K. economy, and we would feel that."
355,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The question for us—it wouldn’t be a huge first-order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial disruptions."
356,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it would reach us."
357,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would expect that we would feel some of this, and it’s very hard to have great confidence that you know what that would be."
358,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But it would be something—probably not material to our economy, but it’s something we’ll be watching very carefully and certainly hoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit."
359,JEAN YUNG,"Hi, I’m Jean Yung with Market News."
360,JEAN YUNG,I have a question about the ultimate size of the balance sheet.
361,JEAN YUNG,How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for financial institutions’ demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past year and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same time frame?
362,JEAN YUNG,"Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to encourage banks from holding—to hold less reserves?"
363,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Let me be clear.
364,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years.
365,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think our understanding of demand for reserves—remember that the banks have more reserves than they need.
366,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Reserves are still quite abundant.
367,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end after, you know, after the firms adjust to our very gradual decrease?"
368,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And so our understanding, really, of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past year."
369,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And then there would be a buffer on top of that.
370,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And then we would want to be—we would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates."
371,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these big, ongoing interventions in the market."
372,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large ongoing presence in the market around this."
373,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’d rather just, you know—in managing the federal funds rate, we’d rather have it set by our administered rates."
374,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that implies you’d want to be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is.
375,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, again, there’s no cookbook here, there’s no playbook."
376,CHAIRMAN POWELL,No one really knows.
377,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligence and then, ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully."
378,JEAN YUNG,"But do you take the survey results as given, or do you try to encourage banks from holding a [inaudible]?"
379,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t take—you know, we don’t think we have a precise understanding of this at all."
380,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I want to be clear about that.
381,CHAIRMAN POWELL,These estimates are fairly uncertain.
382,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the middle], all you can say is, it’s probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart, equidistant from the middle]."
383,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason—which is to say, to hold liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, to meet their resolution requirements and resolution planning—we’re not going to discourage them from holding them."
384,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"They are, in fact, a very safe asset—in a way, the safest asset."
385,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And we want the banks to be safe and sound.
386,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We didn’t create the reserves, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since—in the post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand-new and quite substantial liquidity requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit."
387,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So it’s not a bad thing that banks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset.
388,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t—we’re not encouraging them to hold reserves instead of Treasuries.
389,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for this purpose.
390,COURTENAY BROWN,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
391,COURTENAY BROWN,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
392,COURTENAY BROWN,A data-dependency question: Has there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data?
393,COURTENAY BROWN,How do you balance those two things?
394,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s about, you know, hard, real-side economic data."
395,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We—as I mentioned earlier, we—our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy through financial conditions."
396,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So financial conditions matter, and they matter in the way that I suggested earlier—which is to say, broad financial conditions changing over a sustained period—that has implications for the macroeconomy."
397,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It does.
398,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So if you lower interest rates and they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate."
399,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’ll have an effect on—over time, an effect on the economy."
400,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, again, the entire focus we have is on maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial conditions generally."
401,MYLES UDLAND,"Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance."
402,MYLES UDLAND,"I would just ask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general."
403,MYLES UDLAND,"And are you surprised at how much of a conversation we’re having around the balance sheet, and how much talk about the balance sheet from yourself and various Fed officials have moved financial markets?"
404,MYLES UDLAND,"Because putting out a statement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising, considering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal with balance sheet normalization—to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy."
405,MYLES UDLAND,"And so I would just ask, are you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks?"
406,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy."
407,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was—that would be confusing to markets."
408,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So what we did was we set up the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that was very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to Treasuries, pretty much the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands."
409,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have interest rates be the active tool of policy."
410,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one for our policy and for the benefit of the country."
411,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think that there’s—I think the market is now looking for more clarity around that, and I think we’ll be providing it."
412,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s what’s happened.
413,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Thanks very much.
