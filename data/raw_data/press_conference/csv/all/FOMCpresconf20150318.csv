0,CHAIR YELLEN,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR YELLEN,"As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee this afternoon reaffirmed the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate."
2,CHAIR YELLEN,"We also updated our forward guidance, indicating that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at our next meeting in April."
3,CHAIR YELLEN,"With continued improvement in economic conditions, however, we do not want to rule out the possibility that an increase in the target range could be warranted at subsequent meetings."
4,CHAIR YELLEN,"Let me emphasize, however, that the timing of the initial increase in the target range will depend on the Committee’s assessment of incoming information."
5,CHAIR YELLEN,Today’s modification of our guidance should not be interpreted to mean that we have decided on the timing of that increase.
6,CHAIR YELLEN,"In other words, just because we removed the word “patient” from the statement doesn’t mean we are going to be impatient."
7,CHAIR YELLEN,"Moreover, even after the initial increase in the target funds rate, our policy is likely to remain highly accommodative to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
8,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’ll come back to today’s policy decisions in a few moments, but first I would like to review economic developments and the outlook, which formed the basis for our policy decisions."
9,CHAIR YELLEN,We have seen continued progress toward our objective of maximum employment.
10,CHAIR YELLEN,"The pace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains averaging nearly 290,000 per month over the past three months."
11,CHAIR YELLEN,The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in February; that’s three-tenths lower than the latest reading available at the time of our December meeting.
12,CHAIR YELLEN,Broader measures of job market conditions—such as those counting individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time—have shown similar improvement.
13,CHAIR YELLEN,"As we noted in our March 18, 2015 statement, slack in the labor market continues to diminish."
14,CHAIR YELLEN,"Meanwhile, the labor force Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL participation rate—the percentage of working-age Americans either working or seeking work—is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists."
15,CHAIR YELLEN,"So considerable progress clearly has been achieved, but room for further improvement in the labor market continues."
16,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to expect sufficient underlying strength in economic growth to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.
17,CHAIR YELLEN,"After averaging about 2½ percent over 2014, growth of real gross domestic product appears to have slowed in the first quarter of this year, in part reflecting a moderation in household spending."
18,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, the recovery in the housing sector remains subdued, and export growth looks to have weakened."
19,CHAIR YELLEN,"Looking ahead, however, the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of GDP growth, with robust job gains and lower energy prices supporting household spending."
20,CHAIR YELLEN,"Inflation has declined further below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower energy prices I just mentioned."
21,CHAIR YELLEN,"Declining import prices have also restrained inflation, and in light of the recent appreciation of the dollar, will likely continue to do so in the months ahead."
22,CHAIR YELLEN,"My colleagues and I continue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term."
23,CHAIR YELLEN,"In making this forecast, we are attentive to the low levels of market-based measures of inflation compensation."
24,CHAIR YELLEN,"In contrast, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
25,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
26,CHAIR YELLEN,This assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted for this meeting by the FOMC participants.
27,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, each participant’s projections March 18, 2015 are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
28,CHAIR YELLEN,The unemployment rate Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL projections over the next few years and in the longer run are generally a bit lower than the December projections.
29,CHAIR YELLEN,"At the end of this year, the central tendency for the unemployment rate stands at 5 to 5.2 percent, in line with participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
30,CHAIR YELLEN,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.
31,CHAIR YELLEN,"For economic growth, participants generally reduced their projections since December, with many citing a weaker outlook for net exports."
32,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nonetheless, the central tendency of the growth projections for this year and next, at 2.3 to 2.7 percent, remains somewhat above estimates of the longer-run normal growth rate."
33,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and import prices."
34,CHAIR YELLEN,"The central tendency of the inflation projections for this year is now below 1 percent, down noticeably since December."
35,CHAIR YELLEN,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate, the central tendency rebounds to 1.7 to 1.9 percent next year and rises to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
36,CHAIR YELLEN,"Returning to monetary policy, as I noted at the outset, the Committee reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
37,CHAIR YELLEN,"But with economic conditions improving, and with further improvement expected in the months ahead, we have again modified our forward guidance."
38,CHAIR YELLEN,"In December and January, the Committee judged that it could be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
39,CHAIR YELLEN,That meant that we considered it unlikely that economic conditions would warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings.
40,CHAIR YELLEN,"While it is still the case that we consider it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the March 18, 2015 target range at the April meeting, such an increase could be warranted at any later meeting, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL depending on how the economy evolves."
41,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me emphasize again that today’s modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.
42,CHAIR YELLEN,"In particular, this change does not mean that an increase will necessarily occur in June, although we can’t rule that out."
43,CHAIR YELLEN,"As we noted in our statement, the decision to raise the target range will depend on our assessment of realized and expected progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
44,CHAIR YELLEN,"We continue to base that assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
45,CHAIR YELLEN,We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
46,CHAIR YELLEN,"Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, we continue to expect that—in the words of our statement—“even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy reported by FOMC participants."
47,CHAIR YELLEN,"Compared with the projections made in December, most participants lowered their path for the federal funds rate, consistent with the downward revisions made to the projections for GDP growth and inflation as well as somewhat lower estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
48,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is just below 2 percent in March 18, 2015 late 2016 and rises a bit above 3 percent in late 2017."
49,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projected rate in 2017 remains Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL below the 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants as the rate’s longer-run value, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below that of its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective."
50,CHAIR YELLEN,Participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its normal longer-run level at that time.
51,CHAIR YELLEN,"These include, in particular, the residual effects of the financial crisis, which are likely to continue to constrain spending and credit availability for some time."
52,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would like to emphasize that these forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are conditional on participants’ individual projections for economic output, inflation, and other factors."
53,CHAIR YELLEN,But our actual policy actions over time will be data dependent.
54,CHAIR YELLEN,"Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep."
55,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities."
56,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives.
57,CHAIR YELLEN,Thank you.
58,CHAIR YELLEN,Now I’d be happy to take your questions.
59,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
60,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Hi, thank you."
61,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,So there’s been this pretty consistent reference to expectations of above-trend growth over the last few months.
62,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Now we’re seeing growth downgraded in the context of very explicit references to international and external conditions: weak export growth, oil dragging down inflation, and your March 18, 2015 own comments now on the dollar."
63,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"So my question is, doesn’t this indicate that the Fed’s facing a Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL tougher time—you know, kind of going it alone, decoupling from the rest of the world—than perhaps you expected last fall when this first started to be an issue?"
64,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaining to the first quarter, that real GDP growth has declined somewhat below where it was for the last several quarters of last year."
65,CHAIR YELLEN,And that’s really why the Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.
66,CHAIR YELLEN,There has been a slight downgrading of estimates of growth for this year.
67,CHAIR YELLEN,You mentioned the dollar.
68,CHAIR YELLEN,We noted that export growth has weakened.
69,CHAIR YELLEN,Probably the strong dollar is one reason for that.
70,CHAIR YELLEN,"On the other hand, the strength of the dollar also, in part, reflects the strength of the U.S. economy."
71,CHAIR YELLEN,"The strength of the dollar is also one factor that, as I noted, is holding down import prices and, at least on a transitory basis at this point, pushing inflation down."
72,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here."
73,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that this is not a weak forecast."
74,CHAIR YELLEN,"Taking everything into account, we continue to project above-trend growth."
75,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to project improvement in the labor market by the end of 2015.
76,CHAIR YELLEN,"The central tendency of the participants is, they’re looking for an unemployment rate that will be down to 5.0 to 5.2, which is consistent with their estimates of its longer-run normal value."
77,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, we do see considerable underlying strength in the U.S. economy."
78,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, in spite of what looks like a weaker first quarter, we are projecting good performance for the economy."
79,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press."
80,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"The policy statement today talks about one of the prerequisites you’ll need to start raising rates is to be “reasonably March 18, 2015 confident” that inflation—your inflation target—will be met at 2 percent, but that is coming out Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL at a time when you’ve lowered your forecast on inflation, what—which I would think would make you less confident about it."
81,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,What is it going to take to make you “reasonably confident” about inflation?
82,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, I don’t have a mechanical answer for you."
83,CHAIR YELLEN,"There is no single thing where I’d say, “We must see such-and-such in order to achieve that level of confidence.” We will be looking at a wide array of data."
84,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, we’ve said that we also want to see continued improvement in the labor market."
85,CHAIR YELLEN,"And a stronger labor market with less labor market slack is one factor that would tend to, certainly for me, increase my confidence that as slack diminishes, that inflation will move up over time."
86,CHAIR YELLEN,"Other things I will be looking at—of course, the inflation data, but as we said, we expect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines and the dollar."
87,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we will be looking at the inflation data carefully to see if we can interpret, for example, low levels of inflation—if we see that, which we expect, as reflecting those influences."
88,CHAIR YELLEN,We will be looking at wage growth.
89,CHAIR YELLEN,We have not seen wage growth pick up.
90,CHAIR YELLEN,"We may not see wage growth pick up, I wouldn’t say either that that is a precondition to raising rates."
91,CHAIR YELLEN,"But if we did see wage growth pick up, that would be at least a symptom that inflation would likely move up over time."
92,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ll be watching inflation expectations.
93,CHAIR YELLEN,"Survey measures have been stable; I expect that to continue, but we will be watching it carefully."
94,CHAIR YELLEN,And market-based measures of inflation compensation have fallen.
95,CHAIR YELLEN,They’re low.
96,CHAIR YELLEN,"If they were to move up over time, that would probably serve to increase my confidence."
97,CHAIR YELLEN,"But there are a wide range of things that we will be looking at, including further improvement in the labor market."
98,CHAIR YELLEN,So there’s no simple answer.
99,CHAIR YELLEN,This is a judgment that the Committee will have to make.
100,JON HILSENRATH,Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.
101,JON HILSENRATH,"Chair Yellen, the famous dot plot that we always talk about showed that officials’ expectations for where interest rates are going to end the year in 2015, ’16, and ’17 have come down fairly notably."
102,JON HILSENRATH,I wonder if you could explain to us your analysis of why those estimates are coming down.
103,JON HILSENRATH,"And, specifically, is it a reflection of—what’s changed?"
104,JON HILSENRATH,And is it a reflection of the changes in the Fed’s economic forecast or a change in the way the Fed is reacting to the economy that it sees—its reaction function?
105,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, it’s always hard to know exactly why each participant has written down the forecast they have, but certainly there are changes in the assessments of the economy and forecasts for the economy that would point in the direction of downward adjustment in the funds rate path."
106,CHAIR YELLEN,"For one thing, you do see meaningful downward adjustment in the inflation forecast, certainly for this year."
107,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, importantly, a number of participants have marked down their estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate."
108,CHAIR YELLEN,"So that range has moved down noticeably from—previously it was 5.2 to 5.5, and it’s now moved down to 5.0 to 5.2."
109,CHAIR YELLEN,And downward revisions to the longer-run normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more slack in the economy now than they previously did.
110,CHAIR YELLEN,So I think both of those things would point to downward revision in the funds rate path.
111,SAM FLEMING,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
112,SAM FLEMING,"The experience of some other central banks—notably Japan, Sweden also—suggests that tightening early when you’re at March 18, 2015 the zero lower bound can be a risky process—the risks of tightening early can dramatically Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL outweigh the risks of leaving things a little longer."
113,SAM FLEMING,I wonder if you could comment on that international experience and explain how that’s influencing the debate in the FOMC at the moment.
114,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, when an economy is operating at the so-called zero lower bound, there—it creates a situation where there are asymmetric risks."
115,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is possible, if the economy proves stronger than is expected, to respond to that by tightening policy."
116,CHAIR YELLEN,"If there are adverse shocks to demand that tend to push inflation and economic performance in an adverse direction, it’s not possible to lower rates."
117,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, that’s a reason why, for a number of years, we engaged in active asset purchase programs."
118,CHAIR YELLEN,"So there is a situation there of asymmetric risks, and it does point in the direction of waiting longer to raise rates."
119,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I would say that this is an influence that we—and a set of considerations—that we have long been aware of and have been taking into account, so that it’s not something that just comes into play now."
120,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is a reason that we have held our rates at 0 to ¼ percent for, now, roughly six years."
121,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, we are seeing an economy that’s growing above trend, the labor market is improving."
122,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think some of the headwinds that have long been holding the economy back are beginning to recede, which is a reason that the Committee wants to be able to evaluate incoming data and consider when it may be appropriate to finally raise rates."
123,CHAIR YELLEN,But that is a consideration we have long taken into account.
124,STEVE LIESMAN,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
125,STEVE LIESMAN,"I don’t hear, Chair Yellen, any quantitative measures of what increasing confidence is in inflation or heading back towards—or a further improvement in the job market, which is unusual for a Fed that not too long ago was providing us metrics on unemployment about when it would move with rates."
126,STEVE LIESMAN,"Is it now policy to keep the March 18, 2015 market guessing?"
127,STEVE LIESMAN,And is it thought that you’d have better policy and economic outcomes from Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL less certainty about the path of interest rates?
128,STEVE LIESMAN,"And a kind of related question, if you will: Could you see raising rates while the Committee still judges that the risks are balanced?"
129,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in terms of certainty and providing metrics, we provided a metric or a threshold of 6½ percent several years ago and told market participants and the public that we wouldn’t consider it appropriate to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than that level, as long as inflation was well contained."
130,CHAIR YELLEN,"But our policy needs to be data dependent, and we need to respond to incoming data and our assessment of incoming data in terms of where we think the economy is heading and how close we are to our objectives."
131,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the markets—so, can we provide certainty?"
132,CHAIR YELLEN,Of course we can’t provide certainty because we’re not certain what the data will look like and how the economy will evolve.
133,CHAIR YELLEN,"And to achieve our objectives, we need to watch the data, continually reformulate our best guesses—our forecasts of where the economy is going—and respond appropriately."
134,CHAIR YELLEN,And we can’t provide certainty and shouldn’t provide certainty because economic developments that will unfold are uncertain.
135,CHAIR YELLEN,And what market participants should be doing is looking at incoming data just as we are and forming their expectations for where policy will be going and should be going just exactly as we will be doing by attempting to understand economic developments as they unfold.
136,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that’s—that is what we’re trying to say in this statement, that that’s what we will be doing going forward."
137,CHAIR YELLEN,And we don’t want to—and don’t think it’s appropriate at this point—to provide calendar-based guidance.
138,STEVE LIESMAN,Can I have the second part about the balance of risks—would you raise rates when risks are balanced?
139,CHAIR YELLEN,The risks to what?
140,STEVE LIESMAN,"If risks are balanced, as they say in the statement, could you be raising rates in that context?"
141,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I guess we said the risks to the outlook are balanced."
142,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, I mean, certainly we could raise rates in a situation where the risks are balanced."
143,CHAIR YELLEN,"We need to see, as we have said, we want to see further improvement in the labor market, and we want to feel reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective."
144,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"Binya Appelbaum, New York Times."
145,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"There seems to be an awful lot riding on surveys of inflation expectations, yet those surveys are an imprecise instrument; they don’t seem particularly sensitive to the types of changes in inflation that we have seen in recent years, they don’t seem to differentiate between, say, 1.5 and 2—the expectations remain stable even through those changes."
146,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"Could you talk a little bit about why the FOMC has confidence that those measures are accurate reflections of where inflation is likely to go and whether, you know, the concerns that you’ve articulated about market-based measures at all correspond to concerns that you may have about survey-based measures?"
147,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, survey-based measures aren’t perfect."
148,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the mean—often the mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation, so they seem to be biased."
149,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, they do seem to be useful in predicting actual movements in inflation."
150,CHAIR YELLEN,"And because we think inflation expectations are a determinant of price setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, even if it’s imperfect, in trying to gauge inflation expectations."
151,CHAIR YELLEN,And so we do look at survey measures.
152,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, the fact that survey measures are stable, even if they are stable at levels consistent with inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve, that’s not a guarantee that inflation March 18, 2015 will, over time, move to be consistent with those expectations."
153,CHAIR YELLEN,"An example is Japan, I would Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL give you, where for many years the households and businesses expected positive inflation but there was a consistent undershoot."
154,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, this isn’t a single metric that is perfect, but it’s one of many things we’d look at."
155,CHAIR YELLEN,We also look at measures of inflation expectations based on market differentials between nominal and real or TIPS yields.
156,CHAIR YELLEN,"They’re also informative but can move around for reasons pertaining to liquidity in the Treasury market and in the TIPS market, and also because of changing perceptions of inflation risk."
157,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, they’re not a pure read, either."
158,CHAIR YELLEN,And we want to look at both things and not take away any simple morals.
159,PETER BARNES,"Peter Barnes, Fox Business."
160,PETER BARNES,"Chair Yellen, I wanted to check in again with you on whether or not you see or have any concerns about bubbles out there in the economy, particularly the financial markets—debt and equity markets."
161,PETER BARNES,"And I wanted to refer to your most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress last month, in which you said “overall equity valuations by some conventional measures are somewhat higher than their historical levels ."
162,PETER BARNES,.
163,PETER BARNES,.
164,PETER BARNES,"valuation metrics in some sectors continued to appear stretched relative to historical norms.” In the same report last year, in July, the report specifically mentioned biotech and social media stocks as being “substantially”—let me see here—“substantially stretched.” Do you still feel that way and can you comment on bubbles and particularly these sectors?"
165,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I don’t want to comment on those particular sectors."
166,CHAIR YELLEN,"You know, as we said in the report, overall measures of equity valuations are on the high side but not outside of historical ranges."
167,CHAIR YELLEN,"In some corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually low spreads, and that’s what was referred to in the report."
168,CHAIR YELLEN,"More broadly, we do try to assess potential threats to financial stability."
169,CHAIR YELLEN,"And in addition to looking at asset valuations, we also look at measures of credit growth, of the extent of leverage being used in the economy and in the financial sector, and the extent of maturity transformation."
170,CHAIR YELLEN,"And taking into account a broad range of metrics that bear on financial stability, our overall assessment at this point is that threats are moderate."
171,JENNIFER LIBERTO,"Jen Liberto, Politico."
172,JENNIFER LIBERTO,"So, I want to switch gears a little bit and ask about some of the tension between the Fed and Congress lately, with some lawmakers calling for more transparency and accountability measures."
173,JENNIFER LIBERTO,"And I wanted to ask to what degree that there might be room for the Fed to consider some of these measures, like maybe a rules-based approach like the Taylor rule, or some of these measures that would change up who has a voting seat on the FOMC."
174,JENNIFER LIBERTO,To what degree does that make it more difficult to accomplish your mission?
175,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, I believe the Federal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks of any around the globe."
176,CHAIR YELLEN,"We provide an immense amount of information, both financial—about our balance sheet—and our monetary policy operations."
177,CHAIR YELLEN,We have audited financial statements.
178,CHAIR YELLEN,We publish our balance sheet every week.
179,CHAIR YELLEN,"If you want to know exactly what’s in the SOMA portfolio, it’s listed on the New York Fed website on a CUSIP-by-CUSIP basis."
180,CHAIR YELLEN,I have press conferences.
181,CHAIR YELLEN,We issue minutes.
182,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have, you know, statements that we release right after meetings and transcripts within five years."
183,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, if you put all that together, we are a transparent central bank."
184,CHAIR YELLEN,"With respect to congressional changes that are under consideration that would politicize monetary policy by bringing Congress in to make policy judgments about, in real-time, on our monetary policy decisions."
185,CHAIR YELLEN,"Congress itself decided in 1978 that that was a bad thing to do, that it would lead to poor economic performance, and they carved out this one area of policy reviews, March 18, 2015 of monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits."
186,CHAIR YELLEN,The GAO looks at everything else that Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL goes on within the Fed.
187,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think that that is a central bank best practice.
188,CHAIR YELLEN,The global experience shows that giving central banks independence to make monetary policy decisions that they think are in the best interest of the country and consistent with their mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic outcomes.
189,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, I feel very strongly about that, but we are accountable to Congress."
190,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed’s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere."
191,CHAIR YELLEN,"With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and long have—as a kind of benchmark for thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of policy."
192,CHAIR YELLEN,"But to chain a central bank to follow a simple mathematical rule that fails to take account of many things that are very important in making monetary policy—for example, I was earlier asked about being against the zero lower bound, which is an important special consideration—that would be a very foolish thing to do, and I oppose it."
193,CHAIR YELLEN,"With respect to proposals having to do with voting and the structure of the Fed that you mentioned, a lot of ideas have been mentioned."
194,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would say, for my part, I think the Federal Reserve works well."
195,CHAIR YELLEN,The system we have was put into place by Congress decades ago.
196,CHAIR YELLEN,I don’t think it’s a system that’s broken.
197,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, Congress can revisit the decisions it’s made about the structure of the Fed."
198,CHAIR YELLEN,"There were good reasons for making the decisions that were made about how to structure voting and other things, but—and I don’t think the system is broken, I think it’s working well."
199,CHAIR YELLEN,So I don’t see a need for changes.
200,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, of course, it’s up to Congress to review that."
201,STEVEN MUFSON,"I was wondering whether you could quantify the effect that the stronger dollar has had on economic output so far this year; the extent to which it’s sort of acted as its own rate increase; and what sort of obligation you feel, if any, to make life easier for the ECB, Bank of Japan, and the many emerging market countries that are struggling with some of the issues we struggled with not that long ago."
202,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, with respect to the impact of the dollar on the U.S. economy, I don’t have a quantitative estimate to offer you, but I certainly expect net exports to serve as a notable drag, this year, on the outlook."
203,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, remember, we have to put that in context: There are a lot of things that affect the U.S. outlook, and while that is serving as a drag on economic growth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient strength—particularly in private spending—that we are expecting above-trend growth, even so."
204,CHAIR YELLEN,"With respect to our neighbors, we look very carefully at what’s happening in the global environment."
205,CHAIR YELLEN,"We realize that our own policies affect performance in the rest of the world, and that performance in other countries has an influence on us, so we spend a good deal of time discussing global developments."
206,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is important for us to keep our own house in order, to put in place the policy that’s consistent with the objectives that Congress has given us, and I think a strong U.S. economy certainly is something that is good for other countries as well."
207,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have pledged to communicate as clearly as we can about monetary policy, and I am trying to do that, and will continue to do so."
208,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
209,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,We talked about the risk of tightening too early.
210,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"What about the risk of waiting too long, especially since it can take a while for Fed actions to work their way through the economy?"
211,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I agree with that."
212,CHAIR YELLEN,"Many, many studies over decades and decades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary policy affects the economy, and, therefore, monetary policy does have to be forward looking."
213,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s why we spend so much time preparing forecasts and discussing them, and we want to put in place a policy that will be appropriate for where the economy is heading."
214,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s—that is, you know, a reason that many of my colleagues—most of my colleagues—are anticipating that it will be appropriate to begin to tighten policy sometime this year."
215,CHAIR YELLEN,"In spite of the fact that they are projecting that inflation will be low, they’re looking forward and they see that, by the end of 2016 or 2017, with the labor market recovering, and assuming that inflation expectations remain stable and transitory influences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation heading back to our 2 percent objective."
216,CHAIR YELLEN,"So just as we don’t want to be premature in tightening policy and aborting a recovery that we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also don’t want to be behind the curve in beginning to tighten given those lags."
217,CRAIG TORRES,"Madame Chair, I’d like to preface this by saying, I do believe you stand for accountability."
218,CRAIG TORRES,"And—so, recently, a bunch of us, we’re in a room over there, there was a police guard outside, and your staff had taken our cell phones, and they controlled the Internet in the room—all this to guard the security of the FOMC statement."
219,CRAIG TORRES,"If one of us had leaked it, we would lose our jobs."
220,CRAIG TORRES,"Surely there would be a prosecution, and my friends here in the press would certainly have a banner day with that story."
221,CRAIG TORRES,There was a leak in the FOMC.
222,CRAIG TORRES,We don’t know what happened.
223,CRAIG TORRES,"I’ve asked, I can’t get an answer."
224,CRAIG TORRES,And now Congress is asking.
225,CRAIG TORRES,Both parties want to know.
226,CRAIG TORRES,"I’m not going to ask about the IG’s probe—I understand that’s an active case now, suddenly, after two years of just sitting there."
227,CRAIG TORRES,But I would like to ask what you’ve found at the Board.
228,CRAIG TORRES,"You weren’t Chairman then, you March 18, 2015 were Vice Chair, I believe."
229,CRAIG TORRES,"So what answers do you have, and are you going to respond to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Congress?"
230,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, let me say that the Committee and I, personally, take very seriously our responsibility to safeguard confidential information."
231,CHAIR YELLEN,We have a set of policies and procedures that are in place that we’re to follow if we believe that there have been leaks of confidential information.
232,CHAIR YELLEN,"And this is something that doesn’t occur very often, but if it does occur, we follow those procedures."
233,CHAIR YELLEN,"It has been reported that our Inspector General is engaged in a review at this time of this matter, and in light of that ongoing review, I’m not going to get into details, but let me just say that we welcome that review and are looking forward to its conclusions."
234,CHAIR YELLEN,"With respect to Congress, congressional inquiries—we have arranged to brief members of Congress who’ve asked about this, and we’ll certainly cooperate in trying to provide them the information that they seek."
235,JOHN HELTMAN,"Madame Chair, thanks for taking my question."
236,JOHN HELTMAN,"The banking sector has clearly improved since the crisis in terms of capital retention, but there’s also seemingly a number of scandals involving forex manipulation, of course LIBOR."
237,JOHN HELTMAN,Do you think that the culture at the banks is where it ought to be?
238,JOHN HELTMAN,"And, if not, what is the Fed going to do to improve it, and when?"
239,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, it’s certainly been—I mean, it’s certainly been very disappointing to see what have been some really brazen violations of the law, and we absolutely expect the banks that we supervise to comply with the law and to have in place controls that ensure compliance in organizations."
240,CHAIR YELLEN,"And while changing the culture of organizations is not something that we can achieve through supervision, we will make sure that the banks that we supervise have appropriate compliance regimes in place."
241,CHAIR YELLEN,"And to the extent that compensation March 18, 2015 schemes might be incenting such behavior that inappropriately rewards risk-taking, that’s Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL something that was—we will, you know, look for in our supervision as well."
242,JOHN HELTMAN,I have a follow-up.
243,JOHN HELTMAN,When you introduced—you introduced a compensation rule in 2011.
244,JOHN HELTMAN,When do you think we might see some movement on that—on that rule?
245,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, the agencies—the agencies are working jointly to bring out a rule on this, but we do have supervisory policies in place concerning the structure of incentive pay and compensation, and our supervision covers that topic now."
246,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we have seen, I think, meaningful changes already in the structure of compensation and banking organizations to diminish ways in which it might incent risk-taking."
247,PEDRO DA COSTA,Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires.
248,PEDRO DA COSTA,"I guess I have two follow-ups, one with regard to Craig’s question."
249,PEDRO DA COSTA,"So, before the IG’s investigation, according to Republican Congressman Hensarling’s letter to your office, he says that, “It is my understanding that although the Federal Reserve’s General Counsel was initially involved in this investigation, the inquiry was dropped at the request of several members of the FOMC.” Now, that predates the IG."
250,PEDRO DA COSTA,I want to know if you could tell us who are these members of the FOMC who struck down this investigation?
251,PEDRO DA COSTA,And doesn’t not revealing these facts kind of go directly against the sort of transparency and accountability that you’re trying to bring to the central bank?
252,CHAIR YELLEN,That is an allegation that I don’t believe has any basis in fact.
253,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’m not going to go into the details, but I don’t know where that piece of information could possibly have come from."
254,PEDRO DA COSTA,If I could follow up on his question.
255,PEDRO DA COSTA,"I think when you get asked about financial crimes and the public hears you talk about compliance, you get a sense that March 18, 2015 there’s not enough enforcement involved in these actions, and that it’s merely a case of kind of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL trying to achieve settlements after the fact."
256,PEDRO DA COSTA,Is there a sense in the regulatory community that financial crimes need to be punished sort of more forcefully in order for them to be—for there to be an actual deterrent against unethical behavior?
257,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, the—you’re talking about within banking organizations?"
258,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, the focus of regulators—the banking regulators—is safety and soundness, and what we want to see is changes made as rapidly as possible that will eliminate practices that are unsafe and unsound."
259,CHAIR YELLEN,"We can’t—only the Justice Department can bring criminal action, and they have taken up cases where they think that that’s appropriate."
260,CHAIR YELLEN,"In some situations, when we are able to identify individuals who were responsible for misdeeds, we can put in place prohibitions that bar them from participating in banking, and we have done so and will continue to do so."
261,STEVE BECKNER,Steve Beckner of MNI.
262,STEVE BECKNER,"Good afternoon, Madame Chair."
263,STEVE BECKNER,The FOMC said last September that it will wait ‘til after the first rate hike to stop or to discontinue reinvesting proceeds of its MBS holdings and stop rolling over maturing Treasuries.
264,STEVE BECKNER,What is the FOMC’s current thinking about how long after liftoff you should wait to stop reinvestments and rollovers?
265,STEVE BECKNER,"And, given the very large amounts of Treasuries maturing next year, would it make sense for the FOMC to vary the pace of runoff that it allows?"
266,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, we issued in September a set of normalization principles, and, as you noted, the Committee indicated that we will eventually cease reinvestments or diminish the pace of reinvestments as a way of gradually reducing the size of our portfolio over time."
267,CHAIR YELLEN,"We said we would do that when economic conditions were appropriate after we begin raising rates, because we want changes in the—our target range for the federal funds rate to be the main tool by which we shift the stance of monetary policy."
268,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’ve not made any decision at this point March 18, 2015 about how long it will be, once we begin to raise rates, before we reduce or cease reinvestment."
269,CHAIR YELLEN,"Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL We will see how things go, and the Committee will revisit that and make a decision at a later time."
270,CHAIR YELLEN,You also indicated that we have a substantial quantity of Treasuries that will roll off our balance sheet over the next several years.
271,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s true, and that will—I think, over the next two years, almost $800 billion will mature—and that they will be short-term, obviously, Treasuries at that point, and that’s a way in which we anticipate diminishing the size of our portfolio."
272,STEVE BECKNER,"Can I follow up, please?"
273,STEVE BECKNER,"Some people have suggested that you might need to manage those runoffs a little more granularly, if that’s a word, perhaps pursue a different track for Treasuries versus MBS or, you know, at given quarters when you have very large amounts maturing, and there might be a spike in long-term interest rates, that maybe you would vary the rate of runoff."
274,STEVE BECKNER,Is that—any consideration given to that?
275,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s something for which we’ve made no plans, and I don’t really have anything for you on that."
276,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
277,GREG ROBB,"We hear that productivity takes a long time before you can understand it, but it’s been very low in this cycle."
278,GREG ROBB,What does that mean for Fed policy?
279,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I agree, it has been very low—it’s been disappointingly low."
280,CHAIR YELLEN,A positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is that the labor market has improved more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of economic growth.
281,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the unemployment rate has come down more rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected."
282,CHAIR YELLEN,We have written down our estimates of potential output.
283,CHAIR YELLEN,"In the long run, it is a disappointing factor about the ultimate March 18, 2015 prospects for the U.S. economy if it continues."
284,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would expect it to pick up, and as you can see Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above current levels."
285,CHAIR YELLEN,"But it means it’s something that would, if it persists, retard living standards and would likely retard real wage growth and improvement in living standards for ordinary households."
286,PETER COOK,Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.
287,PETER COOK,"Madame Chair, one clarification, if I could, logistically, and then a question about Congress, a follow-up."
288,PETER COOK,"First of all, you’ve been asked this before, I just want to see if we can clarify."
289,PETER COOK,"When you decide to start raising interest rates, could that decision happen at a meeting in which you—it’s not followed by a press conference?"
290,PETER COOK,"And, on my congressional question, I would like to get your reaction to your—the treatment you received up on Capitol Hill the other day."
291,PETER COOK,"It didn’t look like a very pleasant experience, certainly in front of the House, at least at moments."
292,PETER COOK,I wondered if you have concerns about that.
293,PETER COOK,Has the relationship between the Fed and Congress deteriorated to a point that it causes you concern?
294,PETER COOK,"What, if anything, can you do about it as well?"
295,CHAIR YELLEN,So let me start with the press conferences.
296,CHAIR YELLEN,"I said this previously, and let me reiterate it, that every meeting that the Federal Open Market Committee has is a live meeting at which we could make a decision."
297,CHAIR YELLEN,"Clearly, if we decided for the first time to raise the federal funds rate, it is something—I think it would be appropriate to answer questions and explain in more detail."
298,CHAIR YELLEN,We have long had the capacity to call a press conference after a meeting that we would hold by teleconference—by conference call—and that’s a capacity that was used on a number of occasions by my predecessor during the financial crisis.
299,CHAIR YELLEN,It is something that remains a capacity we have and would expect to use if it were necessary.
300,CHAIR YELLEN,"On the second part of your question, with respect to testimony, you know, it’s very important for the Federal Reserve to be accountable to Congress."
301,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have a wide range of responsibilities, and it’s entirely appropriate for me to testify and be quizzed on a range of topics by members of Congress."
302,CHAIR YELLEN,"I—you know, I think I need to be ready to answer questions on any aspect of Federal Reserve behavior, and that’s an important principle."
