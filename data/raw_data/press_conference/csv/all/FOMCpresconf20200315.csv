0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good evening, everyone."
1,CHAIR POWELL,Today the Federal Reserve took a number of actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote the flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus.
2,CHAIR POWELL,The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world.
3,CHAIR POWELL,"On behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who’ve been harmed."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect people’s health."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"While the primary response to this challenge will come from our health-care providers and policy experts, economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we took other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently view the economic outlook."
11,CHAIR POWELL,The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.
12,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to March 15, 2020 provide jobs for new entrants into the labor market."
14,CHAIR POWELL,Participation in the labor force by people in Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL their prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on some sectors."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well positioned to provide credit to households and businesses."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Like others, we expect that the illness and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"Those in travel, tourism, and hospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, the effects of the outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains."
22,CHAIR POWELL,The weakness abroad will also weigh on our exports for a time.
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress because of the large drop in global oil prices."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation, which has continued to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak."
25,CHAIR POWELL,Financial conditions have also tightened markedly.
26,CHAIR POWELL,"The cost of credit has risen for all but the strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down sharply."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Moreover, the rapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to assess the path ahead."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In the past week, several important financial markets, including the market for U.S. Treasury securities, have at times shown signs of stress and impaired liquidity."
29,CHAIR POWELL,The market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global financial system.
30,CHAIR POWELL,It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by which many other financial assets are valued.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"It plays an important role in allowing households March 15, 2020 and firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"When stresses arise in the Treasury Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL market, they can reverberate through the entire financial system and the economy."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"To prevent this from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we announced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the coming months."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"Similar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage-backed securities, which is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get a mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"To improve the functioning of this market and to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy, we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can continue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price stability goals."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"Of these, I will highlight two."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"First, we reduced the interest rate on discount window loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing that rate to ¼ percent."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"The discount window plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"To make the discount window more effective, we will also offer discount window loans for periods up to 90 days."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for borrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"March 15, 2020 To guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL central banks."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the pressures in their jurisdictions and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"To address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty, we made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our dollar swap lines."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to institutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one-week operation."
47,CHAIR POWELL,These long-standing arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the American taxpayer.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"I won’t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating reserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the Federal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to households and businesses."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"The actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and, indeed, our entire economy weather this difficult period and will foster a more vigor—more vigorous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate."
50,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook.
51,CHAIR POWELL,"We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals."
52,CHAIR POWELL,"Finally, let me note that today’s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday."
53,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
54,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll be—I’ll be happy to take a few of your questions.
55,MICHELLE SMITH,The Chair will now take some questions.
56,MICHELLE SMITH,Please dial “star 1” on your phone to indicate you want to ask a question.
57,MICHELLE SMITH,You will be unmuted when you are called on.
58,MICHELLE SMITH,"[Extended silence] Okay, CNBC."
59,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
60,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this—these actions to be?"
61,STEVE LIESMAN,Do you—do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided?
62,STEVE LIESMAN,"Secondly, there was talk about additional programs that could come out—for example, a Primary Dealer Credit Facility or a Term Auction Facility."
63,STEVE LIESMAN,Do you expect those to be announced soon?
64,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
65,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"But, in general, I’d say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities—thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things—and that’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time."
69,CHAIR POWELL,These are choices that we make to protect ourselves—appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"So that means that the second quarter is probably going to be weak—in fact, in the view of many, output declining—output lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"After that, it’s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s March 15, 2020 going to depend, of course, on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL uncertain, and I would say, in fact, unknowable."
73,CHAIR POWELL,We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy—ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible."
75,CHAIR POWELL,You also asked about other facilities.
76,CHAIR POWELL,"I would point out that we have, of course, responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today."
77,CHAIR POWELL,And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.
78,CHAIR POWELL,"And as I said in my statement, we’re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses."
79,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
80,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thanks."
81,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Marketplace radio.
82,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace."
83,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Chair Powell, I’m wondering, are you considering negative interest rates at this point?"
84,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate?
85,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I’ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee—as you know, we did a year-plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"And we, really, at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset purchases—asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound—so, really, forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of those."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global Financial Crisis, we monitored their use in other March 15, 2020 jurisdictions, we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL appropriate policy response here in the United States."
88,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’re going to the Wall Street Journal."
89,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
90,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
91,NICK TIMIRAOS,"I guess I wanted to understand, specifically, how the actions you’ve announced this evening will get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue."
92,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities undertake—again, to make sure that firms with large drops in income and revenue don’t go bust over the next few weeks or months?"
93,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me tell you how, I think—what our tools can accomplish, and—and really what they’re not designed to accomplish."
94,CHAIR POWELL,So what our liquidity operations—and I’ll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases—are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world."
96,CHAIR POWELL,It’s probably the most liquid large market in the world.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"The MBS market is very important: It’s closely linked to the Treasury market, and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real economy."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"So, two very important markets."
99,CHAIR POWELL,"And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity, and—to the point where we—as you know, last week we offered financing—very large amounts of financing."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more."
102,CHAIR POWELL,"And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase programs that we did today."
103,CHAIR POWELL,And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, why is that important to—to everyone?"
105,CHAIR POWELL,These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system.
106,CHAIR POWELL,"And if they are not functioning well, then other markets—then that will spread to other markets."
107,CHAIR POWELL,And those are the markets that—that amount to—that—where households and businesses typically get credit.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"So we know that dysfunctional financial markets—a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy."
109,CHAIR POWELL,We saw that during the financial crisis.
110,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a very different situation, but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support—to support proper market function in these important markets."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, you asked about households."
112,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s true, we don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not—may experience a period of very low activity."
113,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t have those tools.
114,CHAIR POWELL,"We have the tools that we have, and we use them."
115,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"But this is a multifaceted problem, and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think that, by far, the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers."
118,CHAIR POWELL,"After that, fiscal policy."
119,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming."
120,CHAIR POWELL,"I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief, really, to particular populations and groups."
121,CHAIR POWELL,"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"You—you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I’ve sort of covered that."
124,CHAIR POWELL,"We do think fiscal response is—is critical, and we’re happy to see that those measures are being considered, and we—we hope they are effective."
125,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’re going to go to Fox Business."
126,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
127,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
128,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined."
129,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year, and that’s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meetings."
130,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming, and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation?"
131,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities?"
132,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Thank you.
133,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
134,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on—on inflation, you know, the—the economy’s performed so well, really, over the last few years, and right up through January: historically low unemployment—50-year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years—almost 11 years of expansion so far, and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent."
135,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.
136,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not at all a question of deflation.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way."
138,CHAIR POWELL,"So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to—to have inflation move down even a little bit more."
139,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s—it’s not a question—it’s not—it’s not an issue of deflation.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, it’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"We expect, with uncertainty, that, you know—that it will fall a little bit further, at least, below where it has been."
142,CHAIR POWELL,"We are—of course, we don’t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy, and we’re not seeking authority to do so."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"We haven’t discussed that at the—at the FOMC, and it’s not—it’s not legal authority that we’re seeking."
144,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’ll go to the Financial Times."
145,BRENDAN GREELEY,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
146,BRENDAN GREELEY,This is Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.
147,BRENDAN GREELEY,"You have talked about the mortgage-backed security purchases and the March 15, 2020 Treasury purchases as a stability—a stability operation."
148,BRENDAN GREELEY,I’m pretty sure that every person on this Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing.
149,BRENDAN GREELEY,How do we draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is explicit quantitative easing?
150,BRENDAN GREELEY,Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing?
151,CHAIR POWELL,"So what—what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was, and I mentioned this in my statement."
152,CHAIR POWELL,And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy—households and businesses—and thereby support the overall economy.
153,CHAIR POWELL,How do they do that?
154,CHAIR POWELL,They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"So you see—and I think you’ll see—as these purchases roll forward, you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function, and that will actually support economic activity."
156,CHAIR POWELL,That will be a positive for economic activity.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of what it’s labeled, that’s of less interest to me."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"I really think we are very clear in our minds what we’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be—which would be both better market function and—and—you know, when there’s better market function, it will be—you know, policy will be supporting the economy better."
159,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, Bloomberg TV."
160,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
161,MICHAEL MCKEE,I want to ask some timing questions here.
162,MICHAEL MCKEE,"First, on the—whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase “over coming months.” Is there a timetable for that?"
163,MICHAEL MCKEE,"How long are we talking about—$700 billion, obviously, over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year."
164,MICHAEL MCKEE,And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?
165,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And the same with the interest rate cut to zero—how long do you think that might last, and March 15, 2020 would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL cut it from?"
166,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back?"
167,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, so—sorry."
168,MICHELLE SMITH,"Mike, can you ask your question?"
169,CHAIR POWELL,What was it again?
170,CHAIR POWELL,What was the question again?
171,CHAIR POWELL,Just tell me.
172,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t read my writing.
173,CHAIR POWELL,[Laughter] MICHAEL MCKEE.
174,CHAIR POWELL,I was asking about timing.
175,CHAIR POWELL,How long a period— CHAIR POWELL.
176,CHAIR POWELL,"Ah, okay, great."
177,MICHAEL MCKEE,"—are we talking about for the QE purchases, and how long do you anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again?"
178,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, sorry."
179,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the “in coming months” language.
180,CHAIR POWELL,Let me tell you what we were doing there.
181,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s no monthly cap here.
182,CHAIR POWELL,There's no weekly cap.
183,CHAIR POWELL,"The Desk is going to go out, and it’s going to buy at a strong rate that is—that we think will restore market function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"And that language is open ended, and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that, you know, we’re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to go in strong starting tomorrow, and we’re going to buy across the curve, and we’re going to buy MBS, and we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function."
186,CHAIR POWELL,So that—that’s really what that is.
187,CHAIR POWELL,"As far as—as the policy rate, what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you can see, that’s the test we’ve written down."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you—if you look at it, you’ll see that some things have to happen March 15, 2020 before we’d consider—we’d have to become confident of—that the economy has weathered Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a test we’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that, you know, we’re going to be watching and willing to be patient, certainly."
191,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’re going to go to the Associated Press."
192,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Hi, it’s Chris Rugaber at AP."
193,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"In 2008, you had a lot of coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury—Bernanke doing a lot of things with Paulson and so forth."
194,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"You know, today the White House had its press conference at 5:00."
195,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,You guys are doing something a little separate.
196,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Is there—do you think it would be more helpful to markets—perhaps, in the broader economy, to have a more coordinated response?"
197,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Is that something we might look for in the future?
198,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I would say this."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have different tools."
200,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with them on things, with clear lines of delineation."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy."
202,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not our job.
203,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s their job, with other parts of the Administration."
204,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just that—like that for us with monetary policy.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way."
206,CHAIR POWELL,So those two things are—one for each of us.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"But in the middle there, there are areas where we—where we can cooperate."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, there’s a long history."
209,CHAIR POWELL,You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"You would want them to be regularly exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the, you know, the Chair-to-Treasury-Secretary level, but also through the organization."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"For example, the New York Fed is March 15, 2020 the Treasury’s agent—fiscal agent, as you know, so there’s a lot that goes into debt management Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL and the issuance of debt, which happens at the New York Fed."
212,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we do, actually—we have professional, good working relationships up and down the chain there, and, you know, that—that seems to me to be working."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"And there is—there’s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with—of course, with foreign central banks, but you didn’t ask about that."
214,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’re going to go to the Washington Post."
215,MICHELLE SMITH,"[Silence] Washington Post, are you there?"
216,HEATHER LONG,"Hey, sorry, I’m here."
217,HEATHER LONG,"I think—hi, Chair Powell."
218,HEATHER LONG,Two questions this evening.
219,HEATHER LONG,"First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus, and are you working from home?"
220,HEATHER LONG,If you could shed some light on the precautions you’re taking.
221,HEATHER LONG,"And, second, do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment, or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool set?"
222,CHAIR POWELL,So I feel fine.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"I feel very well, and so there’s no reason for me to be tested."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"We are observing—we’re trying to model good behavior here, so we’re observing quite a lot of teleworking."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, we’re—you know, we’re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings—we’re not having any big, crowded meetings."
226,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.
227,CHAIR POWELL,I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that—that it’s okay for the people to do so.
228,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, it’s important for them to do so."
229,CHAIR POWELL,So I will do that.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of our—of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know, I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"I mentioned our liquidity tools—you know, we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools, and, as I mentioned, we’re prepared to use them."
232,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we’ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies, so I March 15, 2020 think we do have room."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"We—we have not at all made a decision to request further—further Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL tools or authorities from Congress, no."
234,CHAIR POWELL,We—we have not made that decision.
235,CHAIR POWELL,It is not something we’re actively considering right now.
236,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’ll go to the New York Times."
237,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hi, Chair Powell."
238,JEANNA SMIALEK,This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
239,JEANNA SMIALEK,Thanks for taking our questions.
240,JEANNA SMIALEK,"I’m just curious—you know, obviously, you held this meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week."
241,JEANNA SMIALEK,Will you still release a Summary of Economic Projections?
242,JEANNA SMIALEK,"And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the economy as the coronavirus shapes up?"
243,CHAIR POWELL,"So why no—I guess you’re asking, why no SEP, and what’s our forecast?"
244,CHAIR POWELL,"So a couple reasons we didn’t do an SEP. First, we decided on Thursday to move the meeting up by three days to today, and that’s before the SEPs are generally filed."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"They hadn’t been filled out, and we—frankly, we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these announcements."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"Second, and, you know, a number of FOMC participants had already reached out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis, and it really is depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long that goes on."
247,CHAIR POWELL,And that is just not something that’s knowable.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"So, actually, writing down a forecast in that circumstance didn’t seem to be useful, and, in fact, it could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"I do expect that we’ll return to the quarterly—regular quarterly cycle in June, however."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the forecast, so, as I mentioned, you know, we see the U.S. economy starting out strong—from a strong position, different—different as we—as we talked through it today."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"People have a range of perspectives on the way the year is going to go, but I think there’s a March 15, 2020 pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter, with probably out—you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL output declining a bit."
252,CHAIR POWELL,"After that, it becomes hard to say, you know, what’ll happen in the third and fourth quarters and thereafter, and it’s going to depend, again, on—on the path of the virus."
253,CHAIR POWELL,So the thing we do know is that we’ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit and there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible.
254,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
255,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Bloomberg News.
256,CRAIG TORRES,"Hi, Chair Powell."
257,CRAIG TORRES,Craig Torres at Bloomberg News.
258,CRAIG TORRES,You say the path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus.
259,CRAIG TORRES,How important is fiscal policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short and of high human consequence or little human consequence?
260,CRAIG TORRES,"And, second, can you talk a little bit about what’s on your dashboard for economic and financial indicators that you’re going to be watching day to day?"
261,CRAIG TORRES,I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in April.
262,CRAIG TORRES,"What are you going to be watching, and what should we be watching?"
263,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in terms of fiscal policy, I think in the first instance—and you’re—you’re seeing some of this now—is the thing that fiscal policy and, really, only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers, and we’ve seen some of that."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"So, that’s—that’s an important job for fiscal policy."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"More broadly, after that, there’s the question of—of fiscal—broader fiscal stimulus, and I think that’ll depend on the path of the economy."
266,CHAIR POWELL,I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’s some—it’s very hard to predict.
267,CHAIR POWELL,"But there could certainly be—there could certainly be, you know, a need for that."
268,CHAIR POWELL,And your second question was—what was your second question?
269,CRAIG TORRES,Yes.
270,CRAIG TORRES,"It was on what indicators you’re going to be looking at, financial and real."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think, in the very near term, we’re going to be looking at, you know, the Treasury market function."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re really going to be looking to see that financial markets are returning to more liquid, more normal functioning."
273,CHAIR POWELL,That is an essential part of our job.
274,CHAIR POWELL,"That is—actually, you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously."
275,CHAIR POWELL,It’s probably the most important thing we’re doing now is that.
276,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be watching that and we’ll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address—to—to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.
277,CHAIR POWELL,Those are the things I’ll be looking at.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, in terms of economic data, I think it’s just so early."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re really looking—I mean, the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think what happens—what happens during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s going to be—because you may have a—you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things get better in the third quarter, that probably won’t matter so much."
282,CHAIR POWELL,We may be able to come back from that.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"If it lasts longer—so that’s really what I’ll be looking for, is—is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what’s the path it’s going to take and what are the effects on the economy."
284,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’ll go to NBC News now."
285,DAVID GURA,"Hi, Chair Powell."
286,DAVID GURA,This is David Gura from NBC News.
287,DAVID GURA,"And a lot of good questions here, so I’ll—I’ll turn to one that’s more philosophical in nature."
288,DAVID GURA,And you’ve talked a bit about the—the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time.
289,DAVID GURA,"I’m reckoning with fact that my kid’s going to be out of school until April 20 at the earliest, so we’re feeling this very, very acutely."
290,DAVID GURA,"But I wonder if you March 15, 2020 could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL context—how you look at this and how anomalous this thing is with which you and your colleagues are going to have to reckon."
291,DAVID GURA,That’s my first question.
292,DAVID GURA,"The second is, you know, we’ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few weeks, and the market—which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to—has reacted negatively to some of that."
293,DAVID GURA,What do you make of that?
294,DAVID GURA,"Going back to the question that was asked earlier about the toolbox and—and what’s left—what’s left in it, rates are low."
295,DAVID GURA,"Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools therein?"
296,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess your first question is, how—how do we think about the time—the time for this thing?"
297,CHAIR POWELL,"You know—and the truth is, we just don’t know, and, you know, the experts we talk to will say that they don’t know, and that it’s, in fact, unknowable."
298,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going to depend on a number of things.
299,CHAIR POWELL,"First, it’s the measures that we take to, you know, to—with the social distancing, and the—all the things businesses and school and everyone’s doing now."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are."
301,CHAIR POWELL,"You can see that some countries have had a—have been able to, through aggressive measures and really high compliance—have been able to bend the curve and—and do that."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"And whether we succeed or—you know, that’s really the question."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"And I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t, you know—I’ll resist the impulse to guess."
304,CHAIR POWELL,I really don’t know what that will be.
305,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools, and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"That, I think, is—is right now the most important thing that we’re doing."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"Our interest rates will matter—cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts, but they’ll March 15, 2020 matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover."
308,CHAIR POWELL,So—but in the forefront now are the Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL liquidity tools and—and getting that job done well.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, as I mentioned, we—you know, we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases."
310,CHAIR POWELL,I think there—there is room for us to do what we need to do.
311,CHAIR POWELL,"I—I would just close, though, by saying that, you know, typically, fiscal policy does play a major role when—when there are downturns."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"You saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns, and that’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis, and that—that will probably need to be the case here as well."
314,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’ll go to Politico."
315,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
316,VICTORIA GUIDA,Thanks for doing the call.
317,VICTORIA GUIDA,"I just wanted to ask, do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council?"
318,VICTORIA GUIDA,"With all the stress that’s showing up in different markets, do you see risks to financial stability rising?"
319,VICTORIA GUIDA,Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack down on?
320,VICTORIA GUIDA,And are you confident that there aren’t any nonbanks that are systemically important?
321,CHAIR POWELL,FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.
322,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s a big group—it’s got a lot of people.
323,CHAIR POWELL,I think it serves a good purpose.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, you should know that we are, of course, in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies, constantly talking about what’s going on in markets."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a lot of information and conversation on an ongoing basis there, I would say."
326,CHAIR POWELL,So—and the same is true with our central bank contacts around the world.
327,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks around the world, talking about what’s going on."
328,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re having group calls, we’re calling one-on-one, so there’s quite a lot of information being exchanged there."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"And then, your question was, nonbank SIFIs."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, again, that’s a judgment for the—that’s a judgment for the FSOC."
331,CHAIR POWELL,"I—you know, I’m comfortable with the actions that we’ve taken, and if—if we do identify, you know, a systemically important nonbank institution, then we wouldn’t hesitate to designate it, but—although I guess now we’re working more on activities, but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so— MICHELLE SMITH."
332,CHAIR POWELL,Okay— VICTORIA GUIDA.
333,CHAIR POWELL,Financial stability risks—are those rising?
334,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m sorry, the question was— VICTORIA GUIDA."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"Are risks to financial stability rising, given all the stress that’s happening in financial markets?"
336,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, yes."
337,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, you know, that’s—that’s something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are, when you’re having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what’s going on."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re trying to reach a view on—in high uncertainty, and that’s why you see lots and lots of volatility."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"I think there’s more risk to financial stability in an era like—like that than there is when things are really placid, and, you know, we’re going home at 4 o’clock and kind of bored over here."
340,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not the case right now.
341,CHAIR POWELL,"So, financial stability—I would say those—those risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we’re presenting—presented with a challenge that is—is kind of unique, really—it’s not something we’ve all done before."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"I also want to add, though, that, you know, we’re strongly focused on financial stability."
343,CHAIR POWELL,We monitor it carefully.
344,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve built a very resilient financial system.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"The banks are highly capitalized, lots of liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their resilience to stress."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"So our financial stability focus—our focus on an event like this over the last March 15, 2020 10 years will pay dividends, in the sense that you have a much more resilient financial system Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call FINAL than you’ve had before."
347,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’ll go to Market News."
348,JEAN YUNG,"Hi, this is Jean Yung."
349,JEAN YUNG,"I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take-up was a bit low."
350,JEAN YUNG,Is that—did you have any takeaway from that?
351,JEAN YUNG,"Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had envisioned it, or was there something else that you learned from that?"
352,JEAN YUNG,Thank you.
353,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
354,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw, that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets, and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that."
355,CHAIR POWELL,"That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos—sorry, of Treasuries and MBS."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"So we did that, and as you pointed out, the take-up was not as high as many had expected, and I did—we did learn something from that."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"We thought that was worth doing, and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather than trying to intermediate through the dealers."
358,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for our portfolio, so we did that on Friday."
359,CHAIR POWELL,"We bought—the next day, Friday, we went in and we bought across the curve, and we bought, I think, $37 billion worth of securities, and then we saw what happened with that."
360,CHAIR POWELL,"We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn’t what we needed."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures, with the broad support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"And I—I think you can see us working through different solutions and—and finding the one that we think really will work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it."
363,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, we’re going to go to Reuters for the last question."
364,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
365,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
366,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Two things, if I could."
367,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Could you describe any discussions you’ve had in coordination with the major banks—this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers—how far can they draw it down?"
368,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,How much do you think they can put out—out to customer finance?
369,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Did you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something else?
370,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of—of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to do some sort of direct lending facility?"
371,CHAIR POWELL,We have given broad general guidance to the banks.
372,CHAIR POWELL,"We’d like them to use their buffers to provide—you know, to provide loans and—and also to work with their borrowers."
373,CHAIR POWELL,"As you can see, we’re providing a lot of guidance to them across a wide range, and they’re saying they have every intention of doing that."
374,CHAIR POWELL,That’s good to hear.
375,CHAIR POWELL,And—so we’ll see how that works out.
376,CHAIR POWELL,"There—there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know, we hear the banks saying, that’s exactly what they’re going to do, so that’s a good thing."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re—of course, we’ve—we’re—we have nothing to announce on—on 13(3) powers, but, you know, of course, we—that’s part of our playbook in—you know, in any situation like this."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I said, we’re—we’re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate to—you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy, and, hence, to support the availability of credit to households and businesses."
379,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thank you very much."
