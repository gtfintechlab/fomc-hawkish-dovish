0,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Good afternoon, everyone."
1,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Thanks very much for being here today.
2,CHAIRMAN POWELL,[Cough] Pardon me.
3,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable."
4,CHAIRMAN POWELL,All of those things remain true today.
5,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Since the September meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have emerged."
6,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I’ll explain how my colleagues and I are incorporating those crosscurrents into our judgments about the outlook and the appropriate course of policy.
7,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Since September, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well, roughly in line with our expectations."
8,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The economy has been adding jobs at a pace that will continue bringing the unemployment rate down over time.
9,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Wages have moved up for workers across a wide range of occupations—a welcome development.
10,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the year a bit more subdued than most had expected.
11,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Although some American families and communities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong economy is benefiting many Americans."
12,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Despite this robust economic backdrop and our expectation for healthy growth, we have seen developments that may signal some softening relative to what we were expecting a few months ago."
13,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Growth in other economies around the world has moderated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to still-solid levels."
14,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At the same time, financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of months, and overall financial conditions have tightened—that is, they have become less supportive of growth."
15,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook."
16,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Most FOMC participants have, instead, modestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next December 19, 2018 year."
17,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The projections of Committee participants released today show growth continuing at Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and inflation remaining near 2 percent."
18,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The projections also show a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate, which should support the economy and keep us near our goals."
19,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As the economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis and the subsequent recession, the Committee held our policy rate near zero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to recover."
20,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And the economy did recover steadily, if slowly at times."
21,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Three years ago the Committee came to the view that the best way to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.
22,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Today we raised our target range for the short-term interest rates by another ¼ percentage point.
23,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I’ve mentioned, most of my colleagues expect the economy to continue to perform well in the coming year."
24,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Many FOMC participants had expected that economic conditions would likely call for about three more rate increases in 2019.
25,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year.
26,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We always emphasize that our policy decisions are not on a preset course and will change if the incoming data materially change the outlook.
27,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, given recent developments, the statement notes that we “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.” Now I will provide some additional context and detail, starting with a review of policy over the last year."
28,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Last December, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percent."
29,CHAIRMAN POWELL,FOMC participants and many other forecasters were predicting that growth in 2018 would be strong.
30,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"This growth was predicted to push the December 19, 2018 unemployment rate down to near historic lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expected to help push inflation up to 2 percent."
31,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropriate way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 percent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years."
32,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Thus, in December 2017, the median of the projections of FOMC participants pointed to three ¼ point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at 2 to 2¼ percent, still below most estimates of the longer-run normal rate."
33,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Early in 2018, it became clear that the economy was likely to be even stronger than we had expected, in part because the fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and more front-end loaded than most had anticipated."
34,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The signs of a more robust economy proved accurate, and the FOMC has now raised rates four times this year, counting today’s action, one more time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago."
35,CHAIRMAN POWELL,This illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always emphasize.
36,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In 2018, the economy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to a slightly faster pace of policy normalization than had been projected."
37,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"When the economy has, instead, turned out weaker than expected, the Committee has slowed or paused the pace of rate increases as we did in 2016."
38,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And when the economy has performed about as expected, the Committee has generally moved in line with the median projection as we did in 2017."
39,CHAIRMAN POWELL,What kind of year will 2019 be?
40,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We know that the economy may not be as kind to our forecasts next year as it was this year.
41,CHAIRMAN POWELL,History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds may buffet the economy and call for more than a slight change from the policy projections released today.
42,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"With that caveat, there are two important differences in the policy outlook today versus next year."
43,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth moderating ahead."
44,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted some moderation of growth in 2019."
45,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The additional tightening of financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of months along with signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth and inflation projections a bit.
46,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The median of FOMC participants’ projections shows growth of 3 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019.
47,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"With growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit further, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2019."
48,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Inflation in the median projection remains near 2 percent.
49,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Second, the economy has continued to strengthen this year."
50,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, given our four rate increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller boost to the economy in 2019."
51,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"After today’s action, the target range for the federal funds rate is 2¼ to 2½ percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal rate provided by the Committee."
52,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Over the next year, if events play out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be in a range in which judgments of people both inside and outside the Fed will sometimes differ regarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodative, neutral, or modestly restrictive."
53,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes policy in light of the array of diverse views on the Committee."
54,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy closely for indications that the stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near 2 percent."
55,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the individual projections of all FOMC participants.
56,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We sometimes point to the median of these projections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee.
57,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Each participant’s projection represents appropriate policy under the baseline outlook—baseline outlook provided by that participant.
58,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We believe that the SEP provides useful information about Committee participants’ thinking, but the median is not a consensus judgment and certainly does not represent a Committee plan."
59,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed light on the state of the economy, the outlook, and the changing balance of risks."
60,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Neither the pace nor the ultimate destination of any further rate increases is predetermined.
61,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We will adjust monetary policy as best we can to keep the expansion on track, the labor market strong, and inflation near 2 percent."
62,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We know that our policy decisions affect all American families and businesses, and we’ll continue to make our decisions objectively and based solely on the best information and analysis."
63,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
64,SAM FLEMING,Thanks very much.
65,SAM FLEMING,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
66,SAM FLEMING,One of the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.
67,SAM FLEMING,"I wonder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressures."
68,SAM FLEMING,"And in the context of a more data-dependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of inflation moving into next year?"
69,SAM FLEMING,Thanks.
70,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Well, you’re right, Sam."
71,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount."
72,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the financial crisis."
73,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a December 19, 2018 touch below 2 percent."
74,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I do think that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL forward.
75,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned, there’s significant uncertainty about the—both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases."
76,HEATHER LONG,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
77,HEATHER LONG,"Today, the Fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases."
78,HEATHER LONG,"Given that, I’m wondering if the Fed has had any discussion of altering the course of balance sheet normalization and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the FOMC to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019."
79,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Sure.
80,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you go back some years, I think we—people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that."
81,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data."
82,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I think that has been a good decision.
83,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.
84,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I don’t see us changing that.
85,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy."
86,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
87,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
88,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chairman Powell, you talked a little bit earlier about the ability to be patient."
89,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And so as you think about your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current recent pace to a slightly different destination that’s laid out in the projections today?"
90,NICK TIMIRAOS,Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few moves and take more time to get there?
91,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, as background, I would just point to 2018 being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still having what amounts to a positive forecast."
92,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We still are forecasting, individually, growth a bit above its longer-run potential—2.3 percent is what we’re forecasting."
93,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re forecasting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop still further and inflation will remain right near our target.
94,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I’d say that’s a reasonably positive forecast.
95,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Going forward, you know, I will be looking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we’re, in fact, on that path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation."
96,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That will be the main thing.
97,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"More broadly, though, I think we’ve reached the bottom end of the range of Committee estimates of what might be neutral."
98,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think, from this point forward, we’re going to be letting the data speak to us and form the outlook and inform our understanding of what would be appropriate policy."
99,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So there’s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases.
100,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC."
101,STEVE LIESMAN,Could you tell us how three things affected the outlook for the economy and rates?
102,STEVE LIESMAN,The first is how the market’s decline affected the outlook for the economy and for rates.
103,STEVE LIESMAN,"The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or how you factor that into your outlook."
104,STEVE LIESMAN,And the third is comments by the President urging you not to hike rates.
105,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial conditions—a broad range of financial conditions."
106,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really."
107,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we took that on board in our forecast.
108,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’s why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little December 19, 2018 bit."
109,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, remember, that’s in a context of a more accommodative path."
110,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we also took down Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our rate forecast.
111,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we definitely did take that into account, and, as you can see from the statement language, we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments."
112,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And we’re going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop.
113,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things."
114,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you just mechanically drop into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs, you don’t see very large effects."
115,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The large effects would have to come from financial market changes or from losses in business confidence.
116,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And those are things that are very difficult to model.
117,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy."
118,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us.
119,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We have the tools to carry it about.
120,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way."
121,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And you know, we are—we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do."
122,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times."
123,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,You’re about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.
124,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,Your new forecasts say that you’re going to undershoot it for the eighth straight year.
125,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,Should we interpret the dot plot as suggesting that some members of your Committee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the end of next year?
126,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"If so, can you help us to understand why people would be advocating restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation undershoots?"
127,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots."
128,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And you’re right, inflation has continued to surprise to the downside—not by a lot, though."
129,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think we’re very close to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it’s a symmetric goal for us."
130,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that’s how we’re going to look at it."
131,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re not trying to be under 2 percent.
132,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re trying to be symmetrically around 2 percent.
133,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I don’t—you know, I’ve never said that I feel like we’ve achieved that goal yet."
134,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The only way to achieve inflation symmetrically around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we’ve been close to that but we haven’t gotten there yet, and we have not declared victory on that."
135,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that remains to be accomplished.
136,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News."
137,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Just following up on Binya’s question—I guess if you haven’t achieved 2 percent inflation and you don’t see an overshoot, which would be sort of implied by a symmetrical target, what’s the point in raising rates again at all?"
138,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, again, I go back to the health of the economy."
139,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis."
140,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You’ve had growth well above trend.
141,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You’ve got unemployment dropping.
142,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.
143,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in that context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy."
144,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.
145,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It can move to neutral.
146,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It seems appropriate that it be neutral.
147,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral.
148,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s the basis upon which we made the decision.
149,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I also think we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, we’re certainly cognizant of them."
150,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP."
151,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,You’ve established for this coming year a communications panel to look at how the Fed communicates.
152,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all?"
153,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,How do you think the dot plot is working?
154,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot, or is it something that you might tweak a bit?"
155,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So this review, what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it’s a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people."
156,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And what we’re going to do is, we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academic conference in June in Chicago."
157,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, better ideas, old ideas—many of them have been around—and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things."
158,CHAIRMAN POWELL,One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now.
159,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being, and, therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns."
160,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we’d want to be evaluating ideas for—again, for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us."
161,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’re not looking at law changes at all, and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target, for example."
162,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example, on a symmetric basis."
163,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s the sense of that.
164,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned, on the dot plot—you asked about the dot plot."
165,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants—sometimes more useful than others, I’ll admit."
166,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, in general, I think people sort December 19, 2018 of have it figured out and understand what it is and what it isn’t."
167,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But that doesn’t mean we don’t Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL like to repeat what it isn’t, which—it’s not a consensus forecast."
168,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s not something that we vote on.
169,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks."
170,MICHAEL MCKEE,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
171,MICHAEL MCKEE,The balance sheet reduction—how much additional tightening do you think has come from that?
172,MICHAEL MCKEE,"We know in the markets that the cost of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread widening—do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow the markets?"
173,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don’t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening?"
174,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we do watch all of that, but the amount of—the amount of runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small."
175,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes."
176,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we don’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff."
177,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"For example, just—very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates."
178,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term borrowing costs.
179,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, we’re alert to these issues."
180,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’re watching them carefully.
181,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But we don’t see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating significant problems."
182,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Hi, Edward Lawrence, Fox Business Network."
183,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
184,EDWARD LAWRENCE,We’ve seen enormous volatility in the markets recently.
185,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"We know the President said, you know, don’t raise interest rates."
186,EDWARD LAWRENCE,It’s well documented.
187,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"The National Association of Realtors’ chief economist says that it’s starting to affect first-time homebuyers with the mortgage December 19, 2018 rates going up."
188,EDWARD LAWRENCE,When do you think these pauses need to come in next year?
189,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Do we need to keep Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL this, as you say, gradual?"
190,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"And then, in addition, what data are you specifically looking at for you that shows when the Federal Reserve starts to become that headwind in the economy with the rates?"
191,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we’re watching—we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year."
192,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent."
193,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent.
194,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s a pretty positive forecast.
195,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking for data that suggests that that’s, in fact, the path that we’re on."
196,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy."
197,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So that’s what we mean when we say we’re “data dependent.” Of course, we’re always data dependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this context, which is that."
198,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
199,VICTORIA GUIDA,"I wanted to ask, first of all, whether you’re worried that President Trump’s tweeting and statements might interfere with your ability to communicate with markets and why you’re doing what you’re doing."
200,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then, also, I was wondering if you could comment on—Governor Brainard gave a speech recently where she laid out the case for the countercyclical capital buffer being activated."
201,VICTORIA GUIDA,Do you disagree with her analysis?
202,VICTORIA GUIDA,Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing?
203,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I’m not worried, because—about—on the first question— because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that we’re going to do our jobs the way we’ve always done them."
204,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And that involves, you know, I think getting the best thinking together, diverse perspectives."
205,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We—every business—every FOMC cycle, we talk to hundreds of people in all different parts of society, not just business people or market people, but people from community development organizations."
206,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we really do have a pretty broad exposure to what’s going on in all different parts of the country."
207,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And we’re going to take all that information, and we’re going to make the best decisions we can, and nothing will cause us to deviate from that."
208,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is—the countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that allows us to build capital at a time when vulnerabilities—financial stability vulnerabilities—are meaningfully above normal."
209,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And so that’s a tool I’d be absolutely willing to use and happy to use at such time as that test is met.
210,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We meet and discuss that and evaluate it on roughly an annual basis.
211,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We haven’t done it since early this year.
212,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think we’ll be doing it early next year, and we’ll be reaching that judgment then."
213,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I will tell you, I recently gave a speech saying that I believe that financial stability vulnerabilities were roughly at a moderate level."
214,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, for me, that—but I would want to leave open—my mind open on that and have that discussion with my Board colleagues when the issue arises."
215,ANN SAPHIR,Ann Saphir with Reuters.
216,ANN SAPHIR,"You said that policy does not need, at this point, to be accommodative."
217,ANN SAPHIR,"But does it need to be restrictive, as the dots seem to suggest that it will be?"
218,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Does it currently need to be restrictive?
219,CHAIRMAN POWELL,No.
220,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I don’t believe that it is.
221,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I don’t believe that policy is restrictive.
222,ANN SAPHIR,Next year.
223,ANN SAPHIR,The dots suggest it will be restrictive next year.
224,ANN SAPHIR,Should it be?
225,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Yeah, I—I’ve discussed this a couple of times."
226,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s a very good question.
227,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I guess I would just go back to this: The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on.
228,CHAIRMAN POWELL,They’re out in the future.
229,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our—you know, our own personal paths."
230,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be.
231,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are."
232,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so."
233,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I don’t—I wouldn’t put too much on—it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things."
234,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But don’t—I wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy.
235,PAUL KIERNAN,"Hi, Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires."
236,PAUL KIERNAN,Thanks for the question.
237,PAUL KIERNAN,"In Dallas last month you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, sometimes hearing things that aren’t yet showing up in the economic data."
238,PAUL KIERNAN,And I was just wondering if you’re hearing anything from businesses that might explain the recent market moves.
239,PAUL KIERNAN,"You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn’t showed up yet in the data?"
240,PAUL KIERNAN,Thanks.
241,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, if you look at the Tealbook, or—you know, we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their discussions not just with their directors, but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really 1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealbook."
242,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"December 19, 2018 interesting."
243,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"My background is very much working—starting with, you know, a small group of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL people, maybe a company, and working out."
244,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me capture the picture better.
245,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought."
246,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There are many reasons that are given for that, but, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a concern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was?"
247,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Why not?
248,CHAIRMAN POWELL,What might it be—to different people?
249,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But that mood is out there.
250,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That doesn’t mean that it’ll come into the real data in a big way—it may, but—or that financial conditions will tighten further."
251,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’ll just have to see.
252,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit."
253,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ve taken that on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to—you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening."
254,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s how I think about it.
255,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
256,GREG ROBB,Just following up on Paul’s question— President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets.
257,GREG ROBB,"So when you see the markets, you know, what are the markets telling you?"
258,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, financial conditions—broadly speaking, we don’t look at any one market."
259,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We look at a really big range of financial conditions.
260,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time.
261,CHAIRMAN POWELL,A little bit of volatility—speaking in the abstract—some volatility doesn’t probably leave a mark on the economy.
262,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we look for that.
263,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tightening."
264,CHAIRMAN POWELL,There’s been a tightening since right around after—a week or so after the September meeting.
265,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, that—we tried to factor that into our models of the economy and to the results that come out of those models."
266,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"December 19, 2018 That’s how we think about it."
267,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we do, you know—we follow markets really carefully."
268,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator and it really matters if changes are sustained over time."
269,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
270,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Do you still think core PCE is a good measure of whether the economy is overheating?
271,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,What do you think of other measures like setting a target for economic growth and relying more on that?
272,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator."
273,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It has—what’s happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth."
274,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us."
275,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when the economy is strong."
276,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s really true, though, that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment."
277,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Now, it did move up last year."
278,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices."
279,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Most of the time, those two things work together."
280,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"When they work temporarily in different ways, we take a balanced approach."
281,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it."
282,DONNA BORAK,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
283,DONNA BORAK,"Next year, every meeting will be a live meeting."
284,DONNA BORAK,"So, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the market anticipates when a rate hike is coming."
285,DONNA BORAK,"How has the Committee thought through December 19, 2018 communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light of the fact of the tremendous Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL amount of uncertainty going into next year?"
286,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication.
287,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I certainly hope it will.
288,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s the plan.
289,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate that to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be helpful in explaining how we’re thinking and, you know, explaining what we’re thinking about policy going forward."
290,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s the plan.
291,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I do believe it will be a positive development.
292,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we would move at a quarterly meeting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP. As you know, we only update our projections under the current approach quarterly, whereas we have eight—eight meetings."
293,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I think we’ll move to a more—we’ll have the ability to move eight—at eight different meetings.
294,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Not eight times, but at eight different meetings on the year."
295,DONNA BORAK,"I guess that’s sort of the question that I’m trying to drive at is, in terms of communicating to the market, because we’ve been—the market’s been so adjusted to the fact that these are quarter-end rate hikes, and now you have the potential to move eight times a year—is the Fed thinking through how it’s going to communicate when it plans, especially given the amount of uncertainty?"
296,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Yes.
297,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward."
298,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such."
299,DON LEE,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
300,DON LEE,"You mentioned broad-based wage gains this year, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market."
301,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So what we’ve seen is, is a very gradual—and, I think, ongoing—increase in wages."
302,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compensation."
303,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But there are four principal ones.
304,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And they were all kind of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent increase per year.
305,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Now they are all at 3, and they’ve just continued to gradually move up—not perfectly in sync, but—and that’s a number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth."
306,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So in an economic sense, it makes sense."
307,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage increases will continue, and that would be a welcome development."
308,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Wage—wage increases do not need to be inflationary.
309,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn’t have high inflation."
310,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So it would be welcome.
311,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages, along with other, you know, bottlenecks and things."
312,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I would expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation."
313,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t think of it that way.
314,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So did that answer your question?
315,DON LEE,Labor slack?
316,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Labor slack.
317,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Yes.
318,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, by most indicators—we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market."
319,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels."
320,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particularly prime-age males, is still, December 19, 2018 you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level."
321,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Most other age groups in both genders have Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moved back up pretty close to where they were at the last cyclical peak.
322,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, there’s a question, can we go above that cyclical peak?"
323,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And—or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn’t—so we’ll have to find that out."
324,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think, given the strong economy, we’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought."
325,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And that’s nothing but a good thing.
326,JOHN HELTMAN,"Hi, John Heltman with American Banker."
327,JOHN HELTMAN,"A regulatory question, if I may."
328,JOHN HELTMAN,"So, many of the Fed’s regulatory proposals so far, especially this year, have been primarily focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range."
329,JOHN HELTMAN,"That is, a sort of tailoring enhanced prudential standards, particularly for those banks, and I’m thinking of the stress capital buffer as well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion."
330,JOHN HELTMAN,"G-SIBs and the largest banks seem to be sort of left out in a lot of these proposals, and I’m wondering if that is meant to send a message that the Fed does not really intend to change its regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if you’ll get to that maybe later."
331,JOHN HELTMAN,"And I’m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which several members of Congress have sent letters to you asking you to revisit and reconsider."
332,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations.
333,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty.
334,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, in the nature of that, you’re focused more on the smaller institutions."
335,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and supervision to be effective and efficient."
336,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker rule.
337,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s something we’re working on.
338,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we—we think that things need to be looked at carefully."
339,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, again, I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it’s important that the largest financial institutions, the largest and most complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations."
340,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And while we may tailor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change."
341,STEVEN BECKNER,"Steve Beckner, freelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, Chairman Powell."
342,STEVEN BECKNER,"I know you look at many different financial indicators, but let me focus your attention briefly on bond yields."
343,STEVEN BECKNER,"The 10-year note yield has gone down pretty steeply, roughly 50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks."
344,STEVEN BECKNER,I wonder what you make of it.
345,STEVEN BECKNER,"Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for growth, for inflation?"
346,STEVEN BECKNER,"On the other hand, could it be a positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates and helping the housing sector?"
347,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Again, we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators, and I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one."
348,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what’s really going on in the broad picture out there?"
349,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, if you ask what’s going on with the long—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some."
350,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’s consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well."
351,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, we don’t know whether that’ll persist."
352,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed."
353,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth."
354,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, you know, we don’t know that that’ll happen."
355,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I December 19, 2018 mentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL we’ll still have solid growth next year, declining unemployment, and a healthy economy."
356,COURTENAY BROWN,"Hi, Chairman, Courtenay Brown from Axios."
357,COURTENAY BROWN,I’m wondering if you could clear up what’s become a little bit of a debate in the financial community.
358,COURTENAY BROWN,You said in October in an interview with PBS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.
359,COURTENAY BROWN,A month later you said interest rates were just below neutral.
360,COURTENAY BROWN,And I think a lot of people interpreted that as a shift in tone from you.
361,COURTENAY BROWN,Were they right to interpret it that way?
362,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that."
363,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the lower end of the range of neutral."
364,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’ve arrived effectively at the bottom end of that range.
365,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, there are implications of that."
366,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—the pace, rather, and the destination for further rate increases."
367,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And we’re going to be letting incoming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path.
368,MICHELLE FLEURY,"Michelle Fleury, BBC News."
369,MICHELLE FLEURY,"Chairman Powell, you talked about monitoring global developments."
370,MICHELLE FLEURY,"I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute with China."
371,MICHELLE FLEURY,"But could you elaborate on what economic developments you’re referring to, whether Brexit is one of those?"
372,MICHELLE FLEURY,What else?
373,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"More broadly, I’m referring to global growth."
374,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth."
375,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It was the year of synchronized global growth.
376,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018."
377,CHAIRMAN POWELL,What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that.
378,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the December 19, 2018 global economy."
379,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But you no longer have the really strong levels of growth you had in 2017.
380,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that is one—that’s, I think, the key fact."
381,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit—like, you know, like the negotiations between Italy and the EU over their budget."
382,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully."
383,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I’m going to—I’ll mention Brexit.
384,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Our financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready for the full range of possible exits from the EU by the U.K. And they’ve had supervisory involvement from U.S. supervisors, from U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors—we think they are fully prepared for the full range of outcomes that may come out of that."
385,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I was very happy to see the developments around central counterparties today.
386,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time being, resolved."
387,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So it’s something we’re watching carefully.
388,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Honestly, it shouldn’t have major implications for the United States, but, you know, there’s a lot of uncertainty because it’s not something that’s happened before."
389,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we’ll be watching it carefully.
390,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Thanks very much.
