0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
4,CHAIR POWELL,Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.
5,CHAIR POWELL,Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 and ’24."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
21,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating.
22,CHAIR POWELL,"As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants’ inflation projections for this year."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation September 22, 2021 is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal."
25,CHAIR POWELL,The median inflation projection from Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year.
26,CHAIR POWELL,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
29,CHAIR POWELL,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the economic outlook remain."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery."
33,CHAIR POWELL,Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions.
34,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
35,CHAIR POWELL,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
36,CHAIR POWELL,They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last September 22, 2021 December."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"If progress Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted."
40,CHAIR POWELL,We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance.
41,CHAIR POWELL,"While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test."
44,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022."
46,CHAIR POWELL,Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer-run level through 2024.
47,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"More important than any forecast is the September 22, 2021 fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum-employment Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and price-stability goals."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
50,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
51,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
52,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
53,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
54,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.
55,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Thank you, Michelle."
56,RACHEL SIEGEL,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
57,RACHEL SIEGEL,"When it comes to the taper and, eventually, to any rate increases, I’m wondering if you can walk us through what “substantial further progress” looks like, given the latest batch of projections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June."
58,RACHEL SIEGEL,"If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “substantial further progress” looks like, that would be great."
59,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
60,CHAIR POWELL,So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.
61,CHAIR POWELL,"And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others."
63,CHAIR POWELL,So the question is really on the maximum-employment test.
64,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate—50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled."
65,CHAIR POWELL,So that could be substantial further progress.
66,CHAIR POWELL,Many on the Committee feel that the “substantial further progress” test for employment has been met.
67,CHAIR POWELL,"Others feel that it’s close, but they want to see a little more progress."
68,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a range of perspectives.
69,CHAIR POWELL,I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further progress” test for employment is all but met.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, once we’ve met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting; that’s the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee will consider that test, and we’ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper."
72,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
73,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Howard Schneider.
74,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
75,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Thanks, Michelle."
76,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"So, looking at the SEPs, we got now basically four years of inflation above target, and policy never gets to the long-run rate."
77,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"I’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives: one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average household that’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when, for some this year, real wages have actually gone down."
78,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
79,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly for this year."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet."
82,CHAIR POWELL,So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year.
83,CHAIR POWELL,"So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year, and a number—I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths."
84,CHAIR POWELL,Why—those are very modest overshoots.
85,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years September 22, 2021 and three years out."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"These are very, very—I don’t think that households are going to, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot."
87,CHAIR POWELL,That just happens to be people’s forecasts.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework."
90,CHAIR POWELL,We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.
91,CHAIR POWELL,"We want, we’re—that’s really the ultimate test of whether we’re getting this done under the framework."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent."
93,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"But you’re right, those are the numbers."
95,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
96,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Colby Smith.
97,COLBY SMITH,"Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle."
98,COLBY SMITH,"Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I’m wondering what the contours of that debate have been."
99,COLBY SMITH,"For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase?"
100,COLBY SMITH,Or is it about financial stability risks?
101,COLBY SMITH,Or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints?
102,COLBY SMITH,Thank you.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"So this was a unanimous vote today, and I’d say quite broad support for this approach."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ve made their arguments publicly."
106,CHAIR POWELL,"For some of them, it’s a financial stability concern."
107,CHAIR POWELL,"And for others, it’s other concerns."
108,CHAIR POWELL,They can make their own arguments.
109,CHAIR POWELL,"This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the—in the early stages of the crisis."
111,CHAIR POWELL,They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets.
112,CHAIR POWELL,"Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it’s time for us to begin to taper them."
114,CHAIR POWELL,Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.
115,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing."
116,CHAIR POWELL,So we think this is the appropriate way to go.
117,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, broad support on the Committee."
118,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
119,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Nick Timiraos.
120,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal."
121,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering."
122,NICK TIMIRAOS,"But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just a taper, may be closer at hand."
123,NICK TIMIRAOS,Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you’ve articulated?
124,NICK TIMIRAOS,Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?
125,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper."
126,CHAIR POWELL,And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring.
127,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it’s what we adopted last September."
129,CHAIR POWELL,It’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.
130,CHAIR POWELL,"And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market’s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, September 22, 2021 moderately higher inflation over 2 percent—you know, that really depends on the path of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL inflation."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market."
135,CHAIR POWELL,And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.
136,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but—by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023."
137,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.
138,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thank you.
139,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek.
140,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hey, Chair Powell—thank you for taking our questions."
141,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year?"
142,JEANNA SMIALEK,And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate.
143,CHAIR POWELL,"So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing."
144,CHAIR POWELL,So let me just say a couple things about this subject.
145,CHAIR POWELL,We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.
146,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials.
147,CHAIR POWELL,"So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"One of those is—sort of, three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"One is, ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that’s bank securities and other things."
150,CHAIR POWELL,"Secondly, there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets."
151,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.
152,CHAIR POWELL,"And, third, there’s regular disclosure."
153,CHAIR POWELL,"So all of these—everyone’s, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis."
154,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you’d say it’s served us well."
156,CHAIR POWELL,The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"We need to make changes, and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this."
158,CHAIR POWELL,This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review.
159,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.
160,MICHELLE SMITH,Great.
161,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
162,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Steve Liesman.
163,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
164,STEVE LIESMAN,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
165,STEVE LIESMAN,"I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades."
166,STEVE LIESMAN,Do you think it’s appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying?
167,STEVE LIESMAN,Is that one of the modifications that you’re looking at?
168,STEVE LIESMAN,"And in that these—you said yourself, they’re clearly not seen as appropriate."
169,STEVE LIESMAN,"In that the Fed’s code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of the, of conflict, do those trades, in fact—and holdings—violate the Fed’s code of conduct?"
170,STEVE LIESMAN,"Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might get—be done with your review?"
171,STEVE LIESMAN,"Thank you, sir."
172,CHAIR POWELL,Don’t have a timeline yet; we can start with that.
173,CHAIR POWELL,"So, well, let me address the muni question, since that’s in there."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"Meaning I—they’re no—I’m holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities."
177,CHAIR POWELL,So it was not an uncommon thing.
178,CHAIR POWELL,"And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, and I did it without hesitating."
179,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse."
180,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was time to go, and we did."
181,CHAIR POWELL,But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and—who looked carefully at it and said that I didn’t have a conflict.
182,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.
183,CHAIR POWELL,"Secondly, you’re right, though, as—we’re going to be looking at all those things."
184,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes.
185,CHAIR POWELL,"But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process—we’re going to make changes."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public’s interest and the institution that we’re all a part of."
187,STEVE LIESMAN,"I’m sorry, Chair Powell—I just want to follow up."
188,STEVE LIESMAN,You said I was right.
189,STEVE LIESMAN,"When you said “right,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials should not own the same assets they’re buying?"
190,STEVE LIESMAN,Is that— CHAIR POWELL.
191,STEVE LIESMAN,I think that’s a reasonable thing.
192,STEVE LIESMAN,"Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don’t."
193,STEVE LIESMAN,"I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis."
194,STEVE LIESMAN,"They were bought many years ago, actually."
195,STEVE LIESMAN,"And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal September 22, 2021 Liquidity Facility."
196,STEVE LIESMAN,So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event.
197,STEVE LIESMAN,"And I couldn’t sell Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL them, so what I did was, I just held them, checked with the ethics people, and went ahead."
198,STEVE LIESMAN,"So, but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
199,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
200,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
201,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Chris Rugaber.
202,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
203,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
204,CHRIS RUGABER,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
205,CHRIS RUGABER,Wider question about jobs and the Fed’s schedule—the Fed’s policy framework that you laid out here.
206,CHRIS RUGABER,"You and other Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating."
207,CHRIS RUGABER,You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.
208,CHRIS RUGABER,There’s some real-time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply.
209,CHRIS RUGABER,So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports?
210,CHRIS RUGABER,And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans?
211,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
212,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you’re right, we have a—really, I’ll call it a unique situation where, by many measures, the labor market is tight."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that kind—so, quite a tight labor market."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"So our view, I think—widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we’d get out of this strange world where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"And so what happened was, Delta happened."
216,CHAIR POWELL,And you had this very sharp spike in Delta cases.
217,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that."
219,CHAIR POWELL,So some of that may not have happened.
220,CHAIR POWELL,"Also, people didn’t, you know—as you know, hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"So we—so that—really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and leisure, and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta."
222,CHAIR POWELL,So that all happened.
223,CHAIR POWELL,And so what we—we know things that didn’t happen.
224,CHAIR POWELL,I think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time.
225,CHAIR POWELL,"But it still seems that, inexorably, people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020."
226,CHAIR POWELL,They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that.
227,CHAIR POWELL,It just may take a longer time.
228,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re right, though—it didn’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta."
229,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of the—you asked also about the test for November.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met."
232,CHRIS RUGABER,"Well, just a quick—if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September?"
233,CHRIS RUGABER,"And, I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data-dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead?"
234,CHRIS RUGABER,Or are we at a point where you’ve accumulated enough progress that— CHAIR POWELL.
235,CHRIS RUGABER,"So it is, it’s accumulated progress."
236,CHRIS RUGABER,"So, you know, for me, it wouldn’t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report."
237,CHRIS RUGABER,It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.
238,CHRIS RUGABER,And others on the Committee—many on the Committee feel that the test is already met.
239,CHRIS RUGABER,Others want to see more progress.
240,CHRIS RUGABER,"And, you know, we’ll work it out as we go."
241,CHRIS RUGABER,"But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but met."
242,CHRIS RUGABER,"So I don’t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I’d like to see a good—a decent employment report."
243,CHRIS RUGABER,"I mean, it’s not, it’s, again, it’s not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher."
244,CHRIS RUGABER,Great.
245,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
246,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
247,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
248,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Victoria Guida.
249,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Chair Powell."
250,VICTORIA GUIDA,So I wanted to ask about the Vice Chair of Supervision position and just—I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy.
251,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then, just sort of a related question: As you know, Randy Quarles’s vice chairmanship ends next month, and I was wondering if he’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he’s replaced in that role."
252,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"So Dodd-Frank created this position, Vice Chair for Supervision, and it’s, there’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language, as I’m sure you know."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"And, effectively, what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged with setting the regulatory agenda."
255,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it’s a specific grant of authority."
256,CHAIR POWELL,"And in the 10 years, almost, that I’ve been at the Fed, that person has really done that."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would, I think—I respect that authority."
259,CHAIR POWELL,"I respect that that’s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"And, furthermore, you know, it’s fully appropriate to look at—for a new person to come in and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of Vice Chair Quarles’s term, we’re not currently in that situation, and I actually don’t have any updates for you on that today."
262,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll keep you posted on that.
263,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
264,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.
265,STEVE MATTHEWS,Thank you.
266,STEVE MATTHEWS,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework."
267,STEVE MATTHEWS,"In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the Black unemployment rate is 6.1 percent."
268,STEVE MATTHEWS,And I’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African Americans is consistent with full employment or whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy.
269,CHAIR POWELL,"Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, we look at a broad range of—a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is."
271,CHAIR POWELL,And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.
272,CHAIR POWELL,So we will do all of that.
273,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?"
274,CHAIR POWELL,So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw—after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market."
276,CHAIR POWELL,And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see.
277,CHAIR POWELL,"We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"There September 22, 2021 were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic."
281,CHAIR POWELL,We were not—there Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession.
282,CHAIR POWELL,So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this.
283,CHAIR POWELL,It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that.
284,CHAIR POWELL,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, of course, not the current situation."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target."
288,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, really, how we think about it."
289,CHAIR POWELL,"It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment."
290,STEVE MATTHEWS,"Just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about?"
291,STEVE MATTHEWS,"Or should that be—should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?"
292,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, you really—I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn’t be any gap, of course."
293,CHAIR POWELL,We would all love to see no such gap.
294,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard to explain based on typical metrics."
295,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just, it’s quite troubling, but it really is—you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies—frankly, education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’ve identified the part that we can do, and we’ll do that part."
298,CHAIR POWELL,But I’ve always been clear that it’s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.
299,STEVE MATTHEWS,Thanks.
300,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
301,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
302,MICHAEL MCKEE,"—a plan for dealing with a debt default that included prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or, nondefaulted Treasuries and buying those who are—that are."
303,MICHAEL MCKEE,Are any or all of those still on the table?
304,MICHAEL MCKEE,Do you think any of those would work?
305,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised?"
306,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question."
307,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.
308,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a critically important thing.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate."
311,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.
312,CHAIR POWELL,I’m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its obligations—should pay them when and as due.
313,CHAIR POWELL,"And that, you know, no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully protect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they’re due."
314,MICHAEL MCKEE,Good.
315,MICHAEL MCKEE,"If I could follow up, have you discussed options with members of Congress?"
316,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected officials or other appointed officials."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people."
318,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
319,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Hannah Lang.
320,HANNAH LANG,Hi—thanks so much.
321,HANNAH LANG,"Senator Warren sent you a letter last week urging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ungovernable behavior” from the bank."
322,HANNAH LANG,"I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company’s license?"
323,HANNAH LANG,"And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?"
324,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them."
326,CHAIR POWELL,And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation.
327,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.
328,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"So bottom line is, we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws."
330,CHAIR POWELL,But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank.
331,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
332,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.
333,MICHAEL DERBY,Thank you for taking my question.
334,MICHAEL DERBY,You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank presidents.
335,MICHAEL DERBY,"As you know, those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the renomination process earlier this year."
336,MICHAEL DERBY,And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process at the time.
337,MICHAEL DERBY,"So I want to know, did anybody know—did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity?"
338,MICHAEL DERBY,"And, going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston Fed Bank presidents to do their job?"
339,CHAIR POWELL,"So these, I don’t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports annually."
340,CHAIR POWELL,And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020.
341,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t have any reason to think people at the Board would have known about particular trading that’s going on.
342,CHAIR POWELL,"They will see that—there are people at the Fed who see the, you know, see the trading reports when they’re, you know, when they’re annually filed."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s something we take very, very seriously."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"This is an important moment for the Fed, and I’m determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things."
347,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, when we have things to announce, we’ll go ahead and do that, but that’s really what I have for today."
348,MICHAEL DERBY,One small follow-up.
349,MICHAEL DERBY,"I mean, I know that you didn’t have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past-year forms in hand."
350,MICHAEL DERBY,"And at least in the case of, like, the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past."
351,MICHAEL DERBY,"So that, in theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process."
352,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question."
353,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things."
354,CHAIR POWELL,"And if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that someone had done, we wouldn’t wait for the five-year."
355,CHAIR POWELL,We wouldn’t wait that day if there were concerns.
356,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re right, though, these—as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it’s a little stricter."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt."
358,CHAIR POWELL,You can’t trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting.
359,CHAIR POWELL,"And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years."
360,CHAIR POWELL,"So all of these things have been going—to the extent they’ve been going on, they’ve been a matter of public record."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know—but, nonetheless—so that—you know, it was seeming to work just okay."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better.” And we will."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"But you’re right, but it has not been part of the process."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"And, appropriately, I don’t think it should have been."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I wouldn’t blame the people who conduct that review."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn’t have been part of that process."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years."
368,MICHAEL DERBY,Thank you.
369,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
370,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Jean Yung.
371,JEAN YUNG,"Thank you, Michelle."
372,JEAN YUNG,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal."
373,JEAN YUNG,Would you hold off on raising rates?
374,JEAN YUNG,Or how would you think about that?
375,JEAN YUNG,Thank you.
376,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, let me say one thing."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"But more to your point, really, we actually September 22, 2021 have a paragraph in our framework, and something like this has been there for a long time."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, I Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL think it’s paragraph six."
381,CHAIR POWELL,And you’re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary; they’re somehow in tension.
382,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we judge that’s effect—that is the case, what it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
383,CHAIR POWELL,"So, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words."
384,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be—pardon me—to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension.
385,CHAIR POWELL,And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two.
386,CHAIR POWELL,"How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that kind of thing."
387,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t really think we’re in that—we’re sort of in that situation, I’d say, in a short-term way."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"But we think, we do expect that this is sort of—because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that, you’re seeing this temporarily."
389,MICHELLE SMITH,Great.
390,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
391,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Edward Lawrence.
392,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Michelle."
393,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
394,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we’ve been watching, could that be—is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that’s out there?"
395,EDWARD LAWRENCE,In the past you’ve said you’re watching the level of corporate debt.
396,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"So is, what’s your level of concern right now?"
397,EDWARD LAWRENCE,And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?
398,CHAIR POWELL,"About the United States, no."
399,CHAIR POWELL,Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now.
400,CHAIR POWELL,Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic.
401,CHAIR POWELL,We were very concerned in the last year or so.
402,CHAIR POWELL,"We were concerned in September 22, 2021 the last year or so, and then I’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL you’ve got a highly leveraged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"It didn’t happen, potentially—I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES Act and the response that we undertook and all that."
404,CHAIR POWELL,"It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we’ve ever had."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had."
407,CHAIR POWELL,And the government has been working to get that under control.
408,CHAIR POWELL,This is part of that effort.
409,CHAIR POWELL,The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.
410,CHAIR POWELL,"And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it’s something they’re managing."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the implications for us, there isn’t, there’s not a lot of direct United States exposure."
412,CHAIR POWELL,The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed.
413,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing."
414,CHAIR POWELL,But I wouldn’t draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.
415,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
416,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Brian Cheung.
417,BRIAN CHEUNG,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
418,BRIAN CHEUNG,Just wondering if you could give us an update on whether or not you’ve had conversations with the White House about a possible reappointment.
419,BRIAN CHEUNG,And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of builds up.
420,BRIAN CHEUNG,Thanks.
421,CHAIR POWELL,I think the phrase goes: “I have nothing for you on that today.” Sorry.
422,CHAIR POWELL,I’m focused on doing my job— MICHELLE SMITH.
423,CHAIR POWELL,Let’s go to Greg Robb.
424,CHAIR POWELL,"—I’m focused on doing my job every day for the American people, and I don’t have any comment on that, Brian."
425,MICHELLE SMITH,Sorry about that.
426,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Greg Robb.
427,GREG ROBB,Thanks.
428,GREG ROBB,"Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell."
429,GREG ROBB,"I was wondering if, in your discussion about the tapering that—you said that officials think it’s appropriate to end around the middle of the year—if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then."
430,GREG ROBB,I’ve heard some Fed officials say that they wouldn’t shrink the balance sheet.
431,GREG ROBB,Was that discussed?
432,GREG ROBB,And what’s your stance on shrinking the balance sheet?
433,GREG ROBB,Thanks.
434,CHAIR POWELL,"So my thinking on this has been: Let’s get through the taper decision, and then let’s turn to those issues."
435,CHAIR POWELL,"There are a number of related issues that—you mentioned one, Greg, but, you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we’ll do that."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues, rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues, because we’re really not."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time."
438,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve watched other countries and what they’ve done.
439,CHAIR POWELL,So I think we’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it’s time.
440,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s just not time yet, in my thinking."
441,GREG ROBB,Thank you.
442,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
443,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Scott Horsley.
444,SCOTT HORSLEY,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
445,SCOTT HORSLEY,You talked a little bit about inflation expectations.
446,SCOTT HORSLEY,"And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists—which are pretty much in line with the FOMC September 22, 2021 members—and laypeople’s expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey."
447,SCOTT HORSLEY,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL How much weight do you put on laypeople’s expectations?
448,SCOTT HORSLEY,And what do you think accounts for that divide?
449,CHAIR POWELL,So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally.
450,CHAIR POWELL,"The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed."
451,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s only an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’re looking three years out."
452,CHAIR POWELL,And it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term."
454,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s also what expectations are showing.
455,CHAIR POWELL,"So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures, it’s professional forecasters, and it’s household surveys."
457,CHAIR POWELL,"And you just put them all—it’s not, you know, it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it."
458,CHAIR POWELL,"You put them all in, and you measure the change."
459,CHAIR POWELL,"So you should be—and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that."
460,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up."
461,CHAIR POWELL,"Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then."
462,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s not a troubling thing.
463,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important."
464,CHAIR POWELL,We spend a lot of time watching them.
465,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that."
466,CHAIR POWELL,But we don’t really see that now.
467,CHAIR POWELL,"We see more of a moderate increase that is—the September 22, 2021 first part of which is welcome."
468,CHAIR POWELL,"And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and it was good to see them get back up a bit."
469,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, we watch carefully."
470,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
471,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Heather Scott.
472,HEATHER SCOTT,Hi.
473,HEATHER SCOTT,"Sorry, you caught me off guard."
474,HEATHER SCOTT,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking my question."
475,HEATHER SCOTT,I really appreciate it.
476,HEATHER SCOTT,"Again, on the taper timing."
477,HEATHER SCOTT,You say it’s going to last to the middle of next year.
478,HEATHER SCOTT,"But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?"
479,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not my expectation.
480,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we can always—we haven’t decided to taper yet, and we haven’t decided the pace yet."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, it’s not my expectation that we would have to."
482,CHAIR POWELL,"We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we—if it becomes appropriate, though."
483,CHAIR POWELL,Absolutely.
484,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, back in ’13, when we tapered, we always said we weren’t on a preset course."
485,CHAIR POWELL,I think this will be a shorter period.
486,CHAIR POWELL,The economy’s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.
487,CHAIR POWELL,So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.
488,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a very gradual taper.
489,CHAIR POWELL,It will be when we agree on it.
490,CHAIR POWELL,"And, but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate."
491,HEATHER SCOTT,But you wouldn’t expect rate liftoff to happen until you’re finished with that process?
492,CHAIR POWELL,"You wouldn’t, no, because, you know, when you’re—as long as you’re buying assets, you’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’t make any sense to, you know, then lift off."
493,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, what you would do is, you’d speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you’re in."
494,CHAIR POWELL,"Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction."
495,HEATHER SCOTT,"All right, thank you."
496,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
497,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, for the last question, we’ll go to Jeff Cox."
498,JEFF COX,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
499,JEFF COX,I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency.
500,JEFF COX,"I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications that it’s going to come this month."
501,JEFF COX,"But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the Fed’s heading on this, and just wondering if you can provide some update there."
502,CHAIR POWELL,"Sure, I’d be glad to."
503,CHAIR POWELL,So we think it’s really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit.
504,CHAIR POWELL,That’s one of our jobs.
505,CHAIR POWELL,"We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system."
506,CHAIR POWELL,"So there’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter."
507,CHAIR POWELL,And innovation is fantastic.
508,CHAIR POWELL,Our economy runs on innovation.
509,CHAIR POWELL,"But where the public’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases."
510,CHAIR POWELL,"So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like products, we’re working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form."
511,CHAIR POWELL,"We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s work with MIT—the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues."
512,CHAIR POWELL,"As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement—engagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues."
513,CHAIR POWELL,"We September 22, 2021 think it’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL making an informed decision."
514,CHAIR POWELL,The ultimate test we’ll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is: Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?
515,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S. It’ll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system since the 1970s."
516,CHAIR POWELL,"We found the case for this quite compelling—for consumers, businesses, and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system."
517,CHAIR POWELL,"So, bottom line, we haven’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we’ll have."
518,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
519,JEFF COX,If I could have a quick—could I get a quick follow on that?
520,JEFF COX,Thank you.
521,JEFF COX,I was just wondering if—okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global race for digital currencies?
522,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s important that we get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously.
523,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think we’re behind.
524,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s more important to do this right than to do it fast.
525,CHAIR POWELL,We are the world’s reserve currency.
526,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision—by the way, which will be a governmentwide decision."
527,CHAIR POWELL,"We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the minds with the Administration and also probably with Congress."
528,CHAIR POWELL,We would really like to have broad support for this.
529,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a very important innovation.
530,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we would need that to go ahead, and that’s the process we’re engaged in."
531,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks very much.
532,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
