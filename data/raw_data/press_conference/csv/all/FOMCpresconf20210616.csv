0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.
3,CHAIR POWELL,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
6,CHAIR POWELL,Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
7,CHAIR POWELL,The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, the recovery is incomplete, and risks to the economic outlook remain."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average, in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre- June 16, 2021 pandemic levels."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"These factors should wane in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
22,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation has increased notably in recent months.
23,CHAIR POWELL,The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy prices."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, for inflation notably for this year."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected June 16, 2021 to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
29,CHAIR POWELL,"As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
31,CHAIR POWELL,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy."
33,CHAIR POWELL,The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook.
34,CHAIR POWELL,Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy.
35,CHAIR POWELL,"However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk."
36,CHAIR POWELL,Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation June 16, 2021 moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
39,CHAIR POWELL,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
40,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"More important than any forecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative."
44,CHAIR POWELL,Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing to increase—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
46,CHAIR POWELL,The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
47,CHAIR POWELL,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"In coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates."
52,CHAIR POWELL,The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points in order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets.
53,CHAIR POWELL,This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy.
54,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
55,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
56,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
57,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
58,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
59,MICHELLE SMITH,"Rachel Siegel, the Washington Post."
60,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
61,RACHEL SIEGEL,"I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023."
62,RACHEL SIEGEL,"And I’m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare."
63,RACHEL SIEGEL,Perhaps they’ve retired early.
64,RACHEL SIEGEL,Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023?
65,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thank you.
66,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
67,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it’s clear, and I am confident, that we are on a path to a very strong labor market—a labor market that, that shows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think that’s, that’s shown in our projections, it’s shown in outside projections."
69,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we’re going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market."
70,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of exactly what that means, we’ll, we’ll have to see how things evolve."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we have seen—in terms of participation, we’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we, we don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I would tend to, to look at it and think that it—that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"But overall, this is—this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor market."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the near term, you ask as well—so we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"There are very large amounts of job openings, and there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"And the pace of, of filling those jobs is—somehow feels slower than it might be."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’d point to a number of things, the first of which is just that most of the, the act of sort of going back to one’s old job—that’s kind of already happened."
80,CHAIR POWELL,So this is a question of people finding a new job.
81,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s just a process that takes longer.
82,CHAIR POWELL,There may be something of a speed limit on it.
83,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ve got to find a job June 16, 2021 where, where your skills match what, you know, what, what the employer wants."
84,CHAIR POWELL,It’s got to be Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL in the right area.
85,CHAIR POWELL,There’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job.
86,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s sort of a natural thing."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, I would say that we, we look at, for example, a, a significant number of people still say that they’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there’s a lot of public facing because of—because of COVID."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s clearly holding back some people, and that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead."
89,CHAIR POWELL,There’s also the question of childcare.
90,CHAIR POWELL,"Many are engaged in, in caretaking."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"And as schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall—in the fall, then we should see—we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of September, and I’d like some—that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs."
93,CHAIR POWELL,So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into—going into the fall."
95,CHAIR POWELL,"I will also say, though, the last thing I’ll say is, this is an extraordinarily unusual time."
96,CHAIR POWELL,"And we, we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like this."
97,CHAIR POWELL,And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.
98,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy."
99,CHAIR POWELL,We need to see more data.
100,CHAIR POWELL,We need to be a little bit patient.
101,CHAIR POWELL,"And I do think, though, that we’ll, we’ll, we’ll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will—that will inform our, our thinking."
102,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
103,MICHELLE SMITH,Paul Kiernan.
104,PAUL KIERNAN,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
105,PAUL KIERNAN,Thanks for the question.
106,PAUL KIERNAN,"Your—the Committee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year."
107,PAUL KIERNAN,"As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4 percent in the CPI."
108,PAUL KIERNAN,"And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those, those kinds of rates before you get nervous."
109,PAUL KIERNAN,Thanks.
110,CHAIR POWELL,So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.
111,CHAIR POWELL,"But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy."
112,CHAIR POWELL,"So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down."
114,CHAIR POWELL,And we did see that in the case of lumber.
115,CHAIR POWELL,"Another example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation."
116,CHAIR POWELL,Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.
117,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going up at just an amazing annual rate.
118,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time."
119,CHAIR POWELL,So we think we’ll be seeing some of that.
120,CHAIR POWELL,When will we be seeing it?
121,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not sure.
122,CHAIR POWELL,"That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing of that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"But over time, it seems June 16, 2021 likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be—will be temporary."
124,CHAIR POWELL,"Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And we’ll be, you know, we’re going to be looking."
125,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing data.
126,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum-employment goal, but also for inflation."
127,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll be looking at that.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and as I—as I mentioned, we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with our goals."
132,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
133,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC.
134,YLAN MUI,Hi.
135,YLAN MUI,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this."
136,YLAN MUI,"My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases."
137,YLAN MUI,"In that discussion, you said that you didn’t—haven’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress."
138,YLAN MUI,"In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases?"
139,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I expect that we’ll be able to say more about timing as we see more data."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"Basically, there’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that."
142,CHAIR POWELL,"But you can think of this meeting that we had as the “talking about talking about” meeting, if you like."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has—which has served its purpose well, I June 16, 2021 think."
144,CHAIR POWELL,"So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL December, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress."
145,CHAIR POWELL,Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.
146,CHAIR POWELL,"And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting."
147,CHAIR POWELL,"So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and we’ll give advance notice before announcing any decision."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar."
149,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
150,MICHELLE SMITH,"Now we’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP."
151,CHRIS RUGABER,Right.
152,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
153,CHRIS RUGABER,"Well, you mentioned—let me ask about inflation expectations."
154,CHRIS RUGABER,You said they were—I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target.
155,CHRIS RUGABER,"Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures we’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve’s three-year outlook, which jumped a bit—should those sort of be dismissed?"
156,CHRIS RUGABER,And are we only looking at longer-term inflation expectations?
157,CHRIS RUGABER,And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point?
158,CHRIS RUGABER,"And on a related note, would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?"
159,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
160,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So we—yes, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer-term inflation expectations, they’ve moved up."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins."
166,CHAIR POWELL,So that was a concern.
167,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"These are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds."
169,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure you know."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were."
172,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below."
173,CHAIR POWELL,"So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they’re at a good place right now."
174,CHAIR POWELL,It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we think that’s an important reason."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term."
178,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s important.
179,MICHELLE SMTH,"Okay, now we’ll go to James Politi with the FT."
180,JAMES POLITI,"Chair Powell—thanks, Chair Powell."
181,JAMES POLITI,"Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent, and core inflation of 3 percent."
182,JAMES POLITI,"If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress, in your mind?"
183,JAMES POLITI,"And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the—of the discussion in the Committee?"
184,JAMES POLITI,And are we really moving towards sort of a post-pandemic stance?
185,JAMES POLITI,"Is there greater confidence that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than expected?"
186,CHAIR POWELL,"On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make."
187,CHAIR POWELL,And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify.
188,CHAIR POWELL,"That is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think we’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the, the, the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the first time, about the—about the dot plot."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"These are, of course, individual projections."
192,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan."
193,CHAIR POWELL,"And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be—would be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions."
195,CHAIR POWELL,Often they don’t.
196,CHAIR POWELL,"And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate June 16, 2021 moves."
197,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s not because—it’s just because it’s so highly uncertain.
198,CHAIR POWELL,"There is no great Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL forecaster of, of future dots."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"So, so dots to be taken with a—with a big, big grain of salt."
200,CHAIR POWELL,"However, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s outcome based, it’s not time based."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, it’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to exceed 2 percent."
204,CHAIR POWELL,"In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case."
205,CHAIR POWELL,"And, honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants—many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated."
206,CHAIR POWELL,And that would be a welcome development.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"So the other thing I’ll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee."
209,CHAIR POWELL,The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"But in terms of our tools, it’s about asset purchases."
211,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we’re thinking about.
212,CHAIR POWELL,"Liftoff is, is well into the future."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s a consideration for the future."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to think about our progress."
217,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
218,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
219,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that?"
220,CHAIR POWELL,"So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is."
222,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll try to be clear.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"And so all I can say is that we, we think it’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give, and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a—have a decision."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I have nothing further on time."
227,CHAIR POWELL,It wouldn’t be appropriate to say.
228,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to have to see more data.
229,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think."
230,CHAIR POWELL,But we’re making progress.
231,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,So you can’t say generally how far in advance you would signal?
232,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, as we—as we approach that goal, we’ll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can."
233,MICHELLE SMITH,"Great, thank you."
234,MICHELLE SMITH,Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg.
235,CRAIG TORRES,Craig Torres at Bloomberg.
236,CRAIG TORRES,"If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent inflation."
237,CRAIG TORRES,"In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period?"
238,CRAIG TORRES,"Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because, over the next three years, you’re going to be above inflation?"
239,CRAIG TORRES,So what is your look-back period?
240,CRAIG TORRES,Does the Committee have one?
241,CRAIG TORRES,"And if not, why not?"
242,CRAIG TORRES,"And if June 16, 2021 they don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 2¼ percent?"
243,CRAIG TORRES,Thanks.
244,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea."
245,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.
246,CHAIR POWELL,"And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that."
247,CHAIR POWELL,So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"And that under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was, 2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below."
251,CHAIR POWELL,You were always getting back to 2 percent.
252,CHAIR POWELL,"So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"And you’re right, it’s not—it’s not a formulaic approach."
255,CHAIR POWELL,We were clear on that when we announced the framework.
256,CHAIR POWELL,"Was there another part of your question, Craig?"
257,CRAIG TORRES,"That pretty much answers it, Chair Powell."
258,CRAIG TORRES,Thank you.
259,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
260,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.
261,MICHAEL DERBY,Thanks for taking my question.
262,MICHAEL DERBY,So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage that we’ve seen lately.
263,MICHAEL DERBY,I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility.
264,MICHAEL DERBY,And do you believe that the changes in the Fed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that?
265,MICHAEL DERBY,"And then, in a related question, do June 16, 2021 you think that Fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?"
266,CHAIR POWELL,"So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range."
268,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re not concerned with it.
269,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"And so there’s, there’s downward pressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it’s supposed to do."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, your second question was again?"
272,MICHAEL DERBY,"Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have any impact on—do you think that will reduce the, the amount of money coming into reverse repos?"
273,MICHAEL DERBY,"Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed funds rate setting?"
274,CHAIR POWELL,It could have some impact.
275,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’ll have to see empirically.
276,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures."
278,MICHAEL DERBY,"And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility, or that’s just not even really a focus of what the change was?"
279,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not, honestly."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we’ll have to see."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case."
282,CHAIR POWELL,That’s going to be an empirical question.
283,MICHAEL DERBY,"Okay, cool."
284,MICHAEL DERBY,Thank you.
285,MICHELLE SMITH,"We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times."
286,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hey, Chair Powell."
287,JEANNA SMIALEK,Thank you for taking our questions.
288,JEANNA SMIALEK,"I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled."
289,JEANNA SMIALEK,"All the data is pretty—has been pretty roiled by the pandemic, and we’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we’re not sure where participation is going to settle in."
290,JEANNA SMIALEK,"And wages are already looking, you know, decent."
291,JEANNA SMIALEK,"So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and, and sort of how you’re thinking about those wage data."
292,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
293,CHAIR POWELL,"As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look to, and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"We look at a range of indicators, and it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that."
295,CHAIR POWELL,So how do we think about it?
296,CHAIR POWELL,A couple of things.
297,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time."
298,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle."
299,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.
300,CHAIR POWELL,It is a different—it’s a different economy.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window, because they would have—people would have retired anyway, and you’ll be back where you, you would have been."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, June 16, 2021 you know, as, as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know—you know, nine years later— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL eight years later, we were still creating jobs."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it was quite remarkable."
307,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re all going to be informed by that.
308,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we understand this is a different economy."
309,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done."
311,CHAIR POWELL,But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.
312,CHAIR POWELL,You asked about wages.
313,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re seeing wage increases."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation."
318,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see anything like that now.
319,CHAIR POWELL,We do see high wages.
320,CHAIR POWELL,"We see them for, for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"And, but we, we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well."
322,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we think it’s a flexible economy and, and it will clear."
323,CHAIR POWELL,There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but the last thing I’ll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here."
326,CHAIR POWELL,There are still a big group of unemployed people.
327,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them."
328,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going—we’re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"But there’s June 16, 2021 every reason to think that we’ll be in a—in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s a little bit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market."
331,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
332,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.
333,HANNAH LANG,"Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now."
334,HANNAH LANG,Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?
335,HANNAH LANG,And do you ultimately believe a permanent fix is needed?
336,HANNAH LANG,And any information on the timing around that would be—would be helpful.
337,CHAIR POWELL,"What I can say is, we’re working on it."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"But we’ve, we’ve always—our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"When leverage requirements are, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones."
341,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a straightforward thing.
342,CHAIR POWELL,"And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become—ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"So we do think it’s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we’re looking hard at the issue."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, I can’t give you any more."
346,CHAIR POWELL,That’s just something we’re working on.
347,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
348,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business.
349,ANNEKEN TAPPE,Hi there.
350,ANNEKEN TAPPE,Thanks for taking my question.
351,ANNEKEN TAPPE,"Chairman Powell, the price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing."
352,ANNEKEN TAPPE,And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.
353,ANNEKEN TAPPE,"But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we’re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we’re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy."
354,ANNEKEN TAPPE,And I wonder how that would affect the Fed’s outlook at all.
355,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"But—and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don’t want to build, build capacity and then find out that it’s not necessary."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong."
358,CHAIR POWELL,"Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts."
359,CHAIR POWELL,"Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t—it hasn’t come down."
360,CHAIR POWELL,We’re seeing the service sector reopening.
361,CHAIR POWELL,And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.
362,CHAIR POWELL,"But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward."
363,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not—that’s not really where our focus is right now.
364,CHAIR POWELL,"Our focus right now is, we need to—our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s, that’s what we think."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up June 16, 2021 a lot."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"Because if they are, people will build new hotels."
369,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no reason for supply and Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.
370,CHAIR POWELL,So we think that’ll happen.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of uncertainty."
372,CHAIR POWELL,"The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters."
373,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will—you will see that as well."
374,CHAIR POWELL,"But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected."
375,CHAIR POWELL,"And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"We do not expect that, though."
379,CHAIR POWELL,That is not our base case.
380,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there’s a lot to be humble about among forecasters."
381,CHAIR POWELL,Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.
382,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a—it’s a highly uncertain business.
383,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully."
384,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there’s so much uncertainty around this."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly."
386,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
387,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.
388,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Howard Schneider, Reuters."
389,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking this."
390,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,I don’t want to miss the moment here.
391,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,And I just—I noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy.
392,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"So is this the June 16, 2021 effective end, in your view, of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL it’s still cited as a risk?"
393,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s a—it’s a continuum, right?"
394,CHAIR POWELL,"What you’ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths."
395,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s great.
396,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and, you know, that should continue."
397,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety."
398,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that.
399,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re not—you’re not out of the woods at this point.
400,CHAIR POWELL,"And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory."
401,CHAIR POWELL,Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.
402,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that can only help."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving."
404,CHAIR POWELL,I would expect it to continue to evolve.
405,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a lot of judgment in that.
406,CHAIR POWELL,"But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that’s what you do with statement language."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s great to see the progress."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, I would not declare victory yet."
409,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, who doesn’t want to see that?"
411,CHAIR POWELL,"And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated."
412,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this statement in, in toto and the—and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a mark-to-market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there?"
413,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s both.
414,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be June 16, 2021 achieved."
415,CHAIR POWELL,Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved.
416,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s, there’s more Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL grounds for comfort."
417,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.
418,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen very strong labor demand.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people’s minds."
422,CHAIR POWELL,"But that, that is something that I think can factor into things as well—factor into our forecast as well."
423,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Thank you.
424,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
425,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Victoria Guida with Politico.
426,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Chair Powell."
427,VICTORIA GUIDA,"I, I wanted to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this."
428,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So in the projections, inflation is expected to, to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023."
429,VICTORIA GUIDA,"You know, I know that’s obviously—you know, take that with a grain of salt."
430,VICTORIA GUIDA,But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent.
431,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation?"
432,VICTORIA GUIDA,"What, what would be—because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the—in the next couple of years."
433,VICTORIA GUIDA,So would that be the result of a tight labor market?
434,VICTORIA GUIDA,Would that be because this whole situation has raised people’s inflation expectations?
435,VICTORIA GUIDA,How are you thinking about that?
436,CHAIR POWELL,"So what we’re seeing in the near term—again, our base case is that what we’re seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the June 16, 2021 economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really."
437,CHAIR POWELL,So—but you’re Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL right.
438,CHAIR POWELL,"When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it."
441,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what that’s about.
442,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why—that’s why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast, they’re just individual forecasts."
444,CHAIR POWELL,"In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening."
445,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So the, the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation?"
446,CHAIR POWELL,"Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up."
447,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s all in people’s individual thinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what, what the outlook is for 2023."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I shouldn’t do."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent."
451,CHAIR POWELL,"They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework."
452,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we did see inflation expectations moving June 16, 2021 up in the—in the wake of the announcement of the framework."
453,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we don’t really Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL know that."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"So, ultimately, I think it’s consistent with both those things."
455,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
456,MICHELLE SMITH,Now we’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.
457,GREG ROBB,Hi.
458,GREG ROBB,"Hi, thank you for taking my question."
459,GREG ROBB,"Chair Powell, I’m just looking at the forecast, and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much you guys—the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year."
460,GREG ROBB,"I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?"
461,GREG ROBB,"And, and what do you think about that?"
462,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support."
463,CHAIR POWELL,The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.
464,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but you’ve, you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the—of the economy."
465,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts."
466,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023."
467,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year."
468,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that’s a really good year."
469,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum."
470,CHAIR POWELL,"That’ll see—you know, that’ll cause significant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent."
471,CHAIR POWELL,We didn’t have a 3½ percent growth year—we didn’t have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial Crisis and the end of the expansion.
472,CHAIR POWELL,So that would be a good year.
473,GREGG ROBB,"Doesn’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation—where that—you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you know, dropping in some way."
474,GREGG ROBB,"We haven’t seen that, right?"
475,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, the economy’s not, not decel—the economy is still growing, and growing at a, at a very healthy rate."
476,CHAIR POWELL,"Our estimate—I mean, different people have different estimates—but, broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at around 2 percent per year."
477,CHAIR POWELL,"If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining, people should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of things should be happening, businesses should be investing."
478,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think?"
479,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
480,CHAIR POWELL,"As I said earlier, you know, we, we don’t have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening."
481,CHAIR POWELL,And therefore we don’t—we don’t think that—we think it’s unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.
482,CHAIR POWELL,"The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that, that we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation."
483,CHAIR POWELL,All that’s out there still.
484,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, when we get through this, we may well—we’ll be facing those same forces."
485,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we—than we thought?"
486,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
487,CHAIR POWELL,"And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently—or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that."
488,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
489,MICHELLE SMITH,Going to Brian Cheung with Yahoo.
490,BRIAN CHEUNG,"Chair Powell, Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
491,BRIAN CHEUNG,"On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity."
492,BRIAN CHEUNG,"I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5 percent."
493,BRIAN CHEUNG,"But there’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis June 16, 2021 could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher."
494,BRIAN CHEUNG,What would the implications of that be for monetary policy?
495,BRIAN CHEUNG,Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate?
496,BRIAN CHEUNG,And what might be the impact of that?
497,CHAIR POWELL,A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.
498,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates."
499,CHAIR POWELL,"The problem with, with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic."
500,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit."
501,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t want to be in a place where we can’t react.
502,CHAIR POWELL,"A higher neutral rate would, would be—from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us."
503,CHAIR POWELL,"It would give us more room and, therefore, then, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we, it’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision."
505,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we would be alert to—I mean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself."
506,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I think we would be alert to factors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest."
507,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we, we try to keep up with that."
508,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that."
509,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could—that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*."
510,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know which of those stories will come true.
511,CHAIR POWELL,"But, I mean, I’ll give you an example."
512,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just there are—there are a lot of start-ups, a lot of early-stage companies."
513,CHAIR POWELL,And is that going to have that effect?
514,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know.
515,CHAIR POWELL,But we’ll be watching those things carefully.
516,MICHELLE SMITH,"Great, thank you."
517,MICHELLE SMITH,"For the last question, we’ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV."
518,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Mr. Chairman, of course you’ll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street."
519,MICHAEL MCKEE,And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them.
520,MICHAEL MCKEE,"One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy."
521,MICHAEL MCKEE,I wanted to get your view on how you square that.
522,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with announcements."
523,MICHAEL MCKEE,"But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper?"
524,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And, finally, you’ve said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy."
525,MICHAEL MCKEE,And there’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly.
526,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a—that’s a few questions there.
527,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say, first, I think people misinterpret the framework."
528,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the—there’s nothing wrong with the framework, and there’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals."
529,CHAIR POWELL,That’s for starters.
530,CHAIR POWELL,All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework.
531,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re strongly committed to it, we think it’s well suited to our goals, including in this—in this unique time."
532,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you look at the—look at the forecasts that we’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them."
533,CHAIR POWELL,The forecasts are all consistent with that.
534,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve?"
535,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all."
536,CHAIR POWELL,"The situation that we, we addressed in June 16, 2021 our—in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was a situation in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low."
537,CHAIR POWELL,"And what we said was, we wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances."
538,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what we said.
539,CHAIR POWELL,That is not at all the current situation.
540,CHAIR POWELL,"In the current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target."
541,CHAIR POWELL,The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.
542,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s a very different, very difficult version of a standard investment—sorry, a central banking question."
543,CHAIR POWELL,"And that is, how do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular—due to particular things?"
544,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017."
545,CHAIR POWELL,"If you remember, there was—prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out."
546,CHAIR POWELL,So this is much bigger than that.
547,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, it’s not—it’s not easy to tell in real time which is which, but that’s, that’s the question you would face under, really, any framework."
548,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re trying to sort that out."
549,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that."
550,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane."
551,CHAIR POWELL,"We can’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate."
552,CHAIR POWELL,Your second one was?
553,CHAIR POWELL,"Oh, you know, we will—we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress."
554,CHAIR POWELL,And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that.
555,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what we’re doing.
556,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s what we’re going to do, and, and we will follow through on that."
557,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s no—I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction."
558,CHAIR POWELL,"June 16, 2021 But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will—we will taper as Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate."
559,CHAIR POWELL,The third thing was—what was the third thing?
560,MICHAEL MCKEE,"If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy."
561,MICHAEL MCKEE,And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far.
562,CHAIR POWELL,That’s right.
563,CHAIR POWELL,"And we—look, we have to balance the two—the two goals: maximum employment and price stability."
564,CHAIR POWELL,"Often they are—they do pull in the same direction, of course."
565,CHAIR POWELL,"But when we—when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there’s no question that has an effect on activity."
566,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s the channel—one of the channels through which we get to inflation.
567,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think that we’re in a situation like that right now.
568,CHAIR POWELL,"We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole—an unusual hole, actually, because it’s to do with, with shutting down the economy."
569,CHAIR POWELL,"It turns out it’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff."
570,CHAIR POWELL,That’s happening all over the world.
571,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely.
572,CHAIR POWELL,"But we’re going, you know, we’re going to watch carefully to make sure that, that evolving inflation and our understanding of what’s happening is, is, is right."
573,CHAIR POWELL,"And in the meantime, we’ll conduct policy appropriately."
574,MICHELLE SMITH,"Thank you, Mr."
575,MICHELLE SMITH,Chair.
