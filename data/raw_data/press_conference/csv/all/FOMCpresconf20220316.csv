0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’s invasion.
2,CHAIR POWELL,The human toll is tragic.
3,CHAIR POWELL,The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy are highly uncertain.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"The economy is very strong, and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Economic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
9,CHAIR POWELL,The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"But cases have declined sharply since mid-January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024."
13,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"In February, the March 16, 2022 unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and remaining near that level thereafter."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"These supply disruptions have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation."
24,CHAIR POWELL,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home.
25,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
26,CHAIR POWELL,We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.
27,CHAIR POWELL,"As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price-stability goal than previously expected."
29,CHAIR POWELL,"The median inflation March 16, 2022 projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside."
30,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"Our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"As I noted, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate."
33,CHAIR POWELL,The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this year—a full percentage point higher than projected in December.
34,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the following two years, the median projection is 2.8 percent—somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer-run value."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
36,CHAIR POWELL,Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good progress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains—which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade March 16, 2022 and other channels."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL tighten credit conditions and affect the real economy."
42,CHAIR POWELL,Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
43,CHAIR POWELL,We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
44,CHAIR POWELL,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment.
45,CHAIR POWELL,We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.
46,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
47,CHAIR POWELL,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
49,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
50,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
51,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
52,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
53,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
54,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.
55,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hi, Chair Powell."
56,JEANNA SMIALEK,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
57,JEANNA SMIALEK,"I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’re considering the, you know, the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’re weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting “behind the curve.” CHAIR POWELL."
58,JEANNA SMIALEK,"So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated."
59,JEANNA SMIALEK,And why do I say that?
60,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so."
61,JEANNA SMIALEK,"If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong."
62,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is March 16, 2022 continuing at very high levels."
63,JEANNA SMIALEK,Household and business balance sheets are strong.
64,JEANNA SMIALEK,"And so all Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL signs are that this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish—not to say withstand, but certainly flourish—as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."
65,JEANNA SMIALEK,So I guess that’s how I would say I’m looking at that.
66,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
67,JEANNA SMIALEK,And that is our overall objective.
68,JEANNA SMIALEK,But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.
69,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
70,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Howard at Reuters.
71,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"Hi, Chair Powell."
72,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"I was wondering, in the SEPs, you have quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent."
73,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"I’m wondering, how much of that do you feel is the result of the Fed’s stiffer-than-expected action here?"
74,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"You talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?"
75,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think that’s a big piece of it, actually."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices."
78,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent.
79,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s part of what moved those assessments down.
80,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think—I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth."
83,CHAIR POWELL,"It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion."
84,CHAIR POWELL,"So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth."
85,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say it’s quite a strong forecast.
86,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes?"
87,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,“Ongoing increases” doesn’t really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, the way we’re thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting."
89,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to be looking at evolving conditions.
90,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we’ll do so."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"I can’t be perfectly specific about it, but that’s certainly a possibility as we go through the year."
92,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Thank you.
93,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
94,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Rachel at the Washington Post.
95,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Thank you, Michelle."
96,RACHEL SIEGEL,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
97,RACHEL SIEGEL,"I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better?"
98,RACHEL SIEGEL,"And if you don’t start to see that, how will you signal it?"
99,RACHEL SIEGEL,What will you be looking for?
100,RACHEL SIEGEL,And what will you be looking for over the course of the year?
101,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thank you.
102,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would say that at the—before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia—so let’s go back to that.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"So now we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short-term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"The other thing is that you’re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods."
106,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s going to mean more tangled supply chains.
107,CHAIR POWELL,So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally.
108,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.
109,CHAIR POWELL,"But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year."
110,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.
111,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
112,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, over the last six months, the Fed has shifted its policy stance quite a bit."
113,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Six months ago, you were still buying assets."
114,NICK TIMIRAOS,Most officials weren’t projecting any interest rate increases this year.
115,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then."
116,NICK TIMIRAOS,So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy?
117,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
118,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come."
119,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would just say, I would go back to “the economy is very strong,” as I mentioned."
120,CHAIR POWELL,Tremendous momentum in the labor market.
121,CHAIR POWELL,We expect growth to continue.
122,CHAIR POWELL,As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.
123,CHAIR POWELL,"And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’s meeting, I saw a Committee that’s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that."
124,CHAIR POWELL,You couched it in terms of real rates.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, if you look at the SEP, you’ve got people getting close to or even above, in many cases, their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate."
126,CHAIR POWELL,So I understand that doesn’t do it for real rates.
127,CHAIR POWELL,"But if you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint."
128,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s something that we’re focused on.
129,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, it’s a highly uncertain environment."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we don’t know what’s going to happen."
131,CHAIR POWELL,But we do know that we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.
132,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Victoria at Politico.
133,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Hi, Chair Powell."
134,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So, looking at the Summary of Economic Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent."
135,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that’s a little bit uncertain."
136,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So I was just wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates?"
137,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio?"
138,VICTORIA GUIDA,Do you expect to assign a Governor in charge of that?
139,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, sorry."
140,CHAIR POWELL,Tell me again your first question.
141,VICTORIA GUIDA,"My first question is, how much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed’s actions?"
142,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
143,CHAIR POWELL,"So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include, potentially, the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certainly base effects."
144,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re lapping—as you know, when you look at a 12-month trailing window, you’re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year."
145,CHAIR POWELL,So there should be some effects from that in the 12-month picture.
146,CHAIR POWELL,"Really what we’re looking for, though, is month-by-month inflation coming down."
147,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it’s really, it’s all the things we’ve been talking about, you know, that really haven’t helped much, including the shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including labor force participation—all those things that have been sticky and not happening."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"But a big part of it is, though, is the base effects I mentioned as well."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course."
150,CHAIR POWELL,And so you would see that more in ’23 and ’24.
151,CHAIR POWELL,"But also, remember we started talking about rate increases last year."
152,CHAIR POWELL,"For some months now, financial conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases."
153,CHAIR POWELL,So it doesn’t start today.
154,CHAIR POWELL,"The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"So the clock is running on that, and I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well."
156,CHAIR POWELL,"So on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this."
157,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we’re doing that."
158,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we’re doing.
159,CHAIR POWELL,The committee is not active.
160,CHAIR POWELL,"So what’s happening is, things are coming to the full Board, and we’re voting on them."
161,CHAIR POWELL,We’re getting our business done.
162,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we got the stress tests done."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that."
164,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re working ahead.
165,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we don’t have a Vice Chair for Supervision, as you mentioned."
166,CHAIR POWELL,"March 16, 2022 But we’re making do with the situation we have."
167,CHAIR POWELL,And a good number of things have come Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL straight to the Board for approval.
168,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Neil Irwin at Axios.
169,MICHELLE SMITH,[Pause] Let’s go to Neil Irwin.
170,NEIL IRWIN,"Hi, Chair Powell."
171,NEIL IRWIN,It’s Neil Irwin at Axios.
172,NEIL IRWIN,Thanks for taking our questions.
173,NEIL IRWIN,"In the statement of economic projections, we see a forecast of median 1.9 percent fed funds rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year."
174,NEIL IRWIN,"Wondered whether that aligns with your own expectations, in particular on that point of overshooting the long-term neutral rate."
175,NEIL IRWIN,"And, also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced: front-loaded, back-loaded."
176,NEIL IRWIN,How high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?
177,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t—Neil, I’ve never talked about my own SEP projection."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s in there, but I, you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that, because we just haven’t done it."
179,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s because we’re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus."
180,CHAIR POWELL,So I wouldn’t talk about my individual one.
181,CHAIR POWELL,"And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is—there’s seven remaining meetings this year."
182,CHAIR POWELL,This isn’t something we discuss or debate or agree on.
183,CHAIR POWELL,"But there’s seven remaining meetings, and there’s seven rate hikes."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"I would add there’s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which, you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet."
185,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t—but I don’t know.
186,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the year.
187,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"And I can’t give you, I’m not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will say this, that we’ll be March 16, 2022 looking at the data as they come in."
190,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL improvement on inflation.
191,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement.
192,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll be going—each meeting is a live meeting.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ll do so."
194,MICHELLE SMITH,[Long pause] One second.
195,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
196,MICHELLE SMITH,We’re going to try one more time.
197,MICHELLE SMITH,Colby Smith at the FT. [Long pause] Okay.
198,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll come back to Colby.
199,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Edward Lawrence.
200,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Yes.
201,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
202,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Michelle, for the question."
203,EDWARD LAWRENCE,I have a more basic question.
204,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"The last time the CPI inflation—I know you look at PCE, but CPI inflation—was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2 percent."
205,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?"
206,CHAIR POWELL,So I just would say a couple things.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"We have the tools that we need, and we’re going to use them."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet."
209,CHAIR POWELL,"We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market."
210,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we’ll do so."
211,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for.
212,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this."
213,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible]— CHAIR POWELL."
214,EDWARD LAWRENCE,We lost you in the middle of the question.
215,MICHELLE SMITH,"Edward, can you repeat that question?"
216,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"—the impact that—given you’re not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s ability to handle inflation?"
217,CHAIR POWELL,None whatsoever.
218,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, let’s go to Colby Smith at the FT. COLBY SMITH."
219,MICHELLE SMITH,"Thank you, Michelle."
220,MICHELLE SMITH,"Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self-correct?"
221,MICHELLE SMITH,And to what extent does it alter both the Committee’s confidence that long-term inflation expectations will not de-anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot?
222,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
223,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
224,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, that’s something we’re watching report by report."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re certainly, we noticed it in the last meeting."
226,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s part of the overall picture.
227,CHAIR POWELL,"We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that’s part of what’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services."
229,CHAIR POWELL,"And, yes, that is concerning."
230,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"But, really, in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is, admittedly, a large category."
232,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so."
233,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
234,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Steve Liesman at CNBC.
235,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
236,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you can help me understand the kind of logic, if there is one, in the SEP here."
237,STEVE LIESMAN,"As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three-year window below the long-run rate."
238,STEVE LIESMAN,"I look at inflation March 16, 2022 being above, over the three-year window, the long-run—or call it the neutral—rate, so the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economy still runs hot."
239,STEVE LIESMAN,And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the funds rate above the long-run rate.
240,STEVE LIESMAN,"I guess my question is this: Are you not create—giving a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further “behind the curve”—and never really get in front of inflation, because the economy will continue to run hot?"
241,STEVE LIESMAN,"And, kind of on a related issue: You said earlier [that] inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected."
242,STEVE LIESMAN,Isn’t that a choice you’re making?
243,STEVE LIESMAN,"And, if so, why are you making that choice to let inflation run above price stability longer than you’d like?"
244,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
245,CHAIR POWELL,"So our, if you look, our—first of all, there is no—you’re looking at medians."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"But understand that there’s no, it’s not something we voted on."
247,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not a plan.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"But if you look, people do have their in—by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate."
249,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
250,CHAIR POWELL,"So that should stop pushing—that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff."
252,CHAIR POWELL,And you can think of that as further.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"In the next year, and just looking at the median, you’re now above the, you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer-run median."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, in many people’s forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under, in real rates as well."
255,CHAIR POWELL,So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent?
256,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it—I mean, a couple points."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"But this is—clearly, what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that, the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they’re pushing up inflation anymore."
259,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the reality is, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don’t know what will actually happen."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we are determined on that front, and we’ll deal with what comes."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a modal, or most likely, expectation."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"But we’ll deal with what comes, whether it’s better or worse."
265,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
266,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.
267,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Hi.
268,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Thank you.
269,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Well, let me follow up a bit on that."
270,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you’ve penciled in without raising the unemployment rate."
271,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"And I’m wondering, just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand?"
272,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed [funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it’s through higher unemployment?"
273,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Thank you.
274,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, if you take a look at today’s labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a very, very tight labor market—tight to an unhealthy level, I would say."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in principle, if you were—let’s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on March 16, 2022 wages."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economy."
279,CHAIR POWELL,We’re hearing from companies that they can’t hire enough people.
280,CHAIR POWELL,They’re having a hard time hiring.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s really the thinking there, is, you know, these are fairly well-understood channels, interest sensitive."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"And, basically, across the economy, we’d like to slow demand so that it’s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"And that, over time, should bring inflation down."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’ll say again, though, you know, we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there—you really can’t have a sustained period of maximum employment."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability."
287,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re very committed to that.
288,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
289,CHAIR POWELL,"That is our intention, and we believe we can do that."
290,CHAIR POWELL,But we have to restore price stability.
291,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
292,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Scott Horsley at NPR.
293,SCOTT HORSLEY,Thanks.
294,SCOTT HORSLEY,"And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr."
295,SCOTT HORSLEY,Chair.
296,SCOTT HORSLEY,I think I missed some of your answer there.
297,SCOTT HORSLEY,But I have a follow-up question on the labor force.
298,SCOTT HORSLEY,We have seen some gains in the prime-age workforce in the last few months.
299,SCOTT HORSLEY,I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed.
300,SCOTT HORSLEY,Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back into the workforce?
301,SCOTT HORSLEY,And what would that mean for wages and inflation?
302,CHAIR POWELL,It’s hard to say.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, over the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"And that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn’t—it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force longer."
306,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn’t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement.
307,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s not something that happens, in the aggregate, very much."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"But, so that’s what was happening."
309,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that."
311,CHAIR POWELL,This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time.
312,CHAIR POWELL,And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better-paying jobs in the same industry or different industries.
313,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a really attractive labor market for people.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"And once, you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an even more attractive one."
315,CHAIR POWELL,So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply.
316,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a good thing for the country.
317,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a good thing for people.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk."
319,CHAIR POWELL,"That last part is, we’ll have to see whether, empirically, it winds up, works out that way."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not the only thing we’re looking for, though, from inflation."
322,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re looking for help from a number of different places and, most importantly, from our own policy."
323,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
324,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg.
325,RICH MILLER,"Thank you, Michelle."
326,RICH MILLER,"And thank you, Chair Powell."
327,RICH MILLER,I’m sorry; I’m having some communication problems.
328,RICH MILLER,"So I missed some of the stuff you’ve said, and my apologies if this has been asked."
329,RICH MILLER,"Since the FOMC met last January, financial conditions have tightened markedly, equity prices down, Treasury yield’s up, bond spread’s risen, yield curve has March 16, 2022 flattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar’s up."
330,RICH MILLER,Is that welcome?
331,RICH MILLER,And would you like to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL see more in order to achieve your goals?
332,RICH MILLER,Thank you.
333,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions."
334,CHAIR POWELL,That’s how it reaches the real economy—by just the mechanisms you mentioned.
335,CHAIR POWELL,"And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic."
336,CHAIR POWELL,So it is very appropriate to move away from those.
337,CHAIR POWELL,"And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels."
338,RICH MILLER,"When you say “move to a more normal setting” for financial conditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where we are now."
339,RICH MILLER,Am I drawing the right inference from that?
340,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, yes."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions."
344,CHAIR POWELL,They will reflect to some extent—they reflect any number of things.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that March 16, 2022 it’s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL accommodative."
347,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
348,MICHELLE SMITH,Just a little housekeeping note: Those of you in this call may be having some tech issues.
349,MICHELLE SMITH,"If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly on www.federalreserve.gov."
350,MICHELLE SMITH,You might go there for the audio.
351,MICHELLE SMITH,And now we’ll go to Jean Yung.
352,JEAN YUNG,"Hi, Chair Powell."
353,JEAN YUNG,I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you had at this meeting.
354,JEAN YUNG,Can you give us any more details?
355,JEAN YUNG,"Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs or whether to increase those caps over what period, if there were any details?"
356,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
357,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you for asking.
358,CHAIR POWELL,"So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet."
359,CHAIR POWELL,And I’d say we’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll actually begin a runoff at a coming meeting.
360,CHAIR POWELL,And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May.
361,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not a decision that we’ve made.
362,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say that that’s how well our discussions went in the last two days.
363,CHAIR POWELL,So a couple things just to add.
364,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, and we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability."
365,CHAIR POWELL,We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what’s a highly uncertain situation already.
366,CHAIR POWELL,So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this.
367,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of the—I would say this.
368,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t want to get too much into the details, because we’re literally just finalizing them."
369,CHAIR POWELL,But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this.
370,CHAIR POWELL,But it’ll be faster than the last time.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, it’s much sooner in a cycle than last time."
372,CHAIR POWELL,But it will look familiar to you.
373,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would also say that there’ll be—I’m sure there’ll be a more detailed discussion of our—in the minutes March 16, 2022 to our meeting that come out in three weeks, where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL much the parameters of what we’re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar."
374,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
375,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.
376,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ve been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down."
377,MICHAEL MCKEE,That seems to be over.
378,MICHAEL MCKEE,But I’m wondering how you would describe your reaction function now.
379,MICHAEL MCKEE,What is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down?
380,MICHAEL MCKEE,"In other words, is it, we’re going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?"
381,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
382,CHAIR POWELL,So I want to clear one thing up again.
383,CHAIR POWELL,And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates.
384,CHAIR POWELL,"What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don’t see inflation, then we’re not going to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation."
386,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s what we said, and that was the sense of it."
387,CHAIR POWELL,"There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates."
388,CHAIR POWELL,That’s simply not in the framework.
389,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, quite the contrary."
390,CHAIR POWELL,The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
391,CHAIR POWELL,"So I do hear this, you know, that the framework—really, we can’t blame the framework."
392,CHAIR POWELL,"It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation."
393,CHAIR POWELL,"And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was."
394,CHAIR POWELL,But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework.
395,CHAIR POWELL,"So, come to today."
396,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear."
397,CHAIR POWELL,What we see is a strong labor market.
398,CHAIR POWELL,"We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation."
399,CHAIR POWELL,And we see the underlying economy’s strong.
400,CHAIR POWELL,Balance sheets are strong.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, there are threats to growth March 16, 2022 from, you know, from what’s going on in Eastern Europe."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"And, but, nonetheless, in the base Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL case, there’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth."
403,CHAIR POWELL,But inflation is far above our target.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the help we’ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better—it hasn’t come."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we’re looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we’re committed to doing that."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"And you see that, I think, in the Summary of Economic Projections."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ll continue to see it in the decisions we make, going forward."
408,MICHAEL MCKEE,"If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’d call it is the “Paul Volcker” question: You don’t think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but, if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?"
409,CHAIR POWELL,"The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a dual mandate, and they’re sort of equal."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, it’s a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market."
414,CHAIR POWELL,"It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion."
415,CHAIR POWELL,"It, just, the pandemic arrived; it was just a completely exogenous event."
416,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
417,CHAIR POWELL,"We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do understand also that, really, you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability."
419,CHAIR POWELL,"So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong."
420,CHAIR POWELL,We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.
421,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
422,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo.
423,BRIAN CHEUNG,"Hi, Chair Powell."
424,BRIAN CHEUNG,Hopefully no tech issues here on this front.
425,BRIAN CHEUNG,Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed’s doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is.
426,BRIAN CHEUNG,How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they’re feeling at the stores on a daily basis?
427,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
428,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.
429,CHAIR POWELL,"We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people’s well-being."
430,CHAIR POWELL,"And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I mean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to absorb some inflation."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up."
433,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s punishing for everyone.
434,CHAIR POWELL,So it has been a difficult time for the economy.
435,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"It may take longer than we like, but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down."
437,CHAIR POWELL,You asked about rates.
438,CHAIR POWELL,"So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply."
440,CHAIR POWELL,And that brings—that will bring inflation down over time.
441,CHAIR POWELL,That’s our plan.
442,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
443,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News.
444,JO LING KENT,"Hi, Chair Powell."
445,JO LING KENT,Thank you so much for taking my question during this today.
446,JO LING KENT,My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked.
447,JO LING KENT,What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?
448,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, that is—yes, indeed."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it’s our obligation to restore price stability."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted."
451,CHAIR POWELL,But now we see the pain.
452,CHAIR POWELL,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which—our target is 2 percent inflation."
454,CHAIR POWELL,So we will do that.
455,CHAIR POWELL,"And I just would want people to understand that, and that’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity."
457,CHAIR POWELL,"That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong."
458,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong."
459,CHAIR POWELL,"And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases."
460,JO LING KENT,"And as a quick follow-up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession."
461,JO LING KENT,"For the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?"
462,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong."
463,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output."
464,CHAIR POWELL,So—and we expect that to continue.
465,CHAIR POWELL,"And to the March 16, 2022 extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt."
466,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do believe that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation."
467,CHAIR POWELL,We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market.
468,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market is—it’s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word.
469,CHAIR POWELL,"We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person or where there, if you add job openings to those who are employed, that’s actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce, than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce."
470,CHAIR POWELL,So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.
471,CHAIR POWELL,"And when that happens, prices go up."
472,CHAIR POWELL,And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.
473,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t think we need to do this alone.
474,CHAIR POWELL,There will be other factors helping that happen.
475,CHAIR POWELL,But we certainly are prepared to use our tools—and we will.
476,JO LING KENT,Thank you.
477,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
478,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Simon at the Economist.
479,SIMON RABINOVITCH,Hi.
480,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"Thank you, Michelle."
481,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
482,SIMON RABINOVITCH,Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute.
483,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and, specifically, the freezing of the central bank assets?"
484,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"Of course, that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies, potentially."
485,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"Any concerns about, in the long term, how this might affect the dollar’s status as the preeminent global reserve currency?"
486,SIMON RABINOVITCH,"And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds of reassurance to other central bankers around the world?"
487,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions."
488,CHAIR POWELL,"But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that’s true everywhere."
489,CHAIR POWELL,"So the Administration and the Treasury March 16, 2022 Department, in particular, and other agencies—they create these sanctions."
490,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re there to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL provide technical expertise, but they’re not, it’s not our decisions."
491,CHAIR POWELL,"And so I’m reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because, again, they’re not for us [to decide]."
492,CHAIR POWELL,We have a very specific mandate.
493,CHAIR POWELL,"And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned."
494,CHAIR POWELL,So I’d have to leave it at that.
495,CHAIR POWELL,Sorry.
496,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
497,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.
498,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"Hi, Chair Powell."
499,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Thanks for taking the question.
500,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,"You’ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great thing, but are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage–price spiral?"
501,CHAIR POWELL,"So the way I would say it is this: We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing."
502,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, that’s how the standard of living rises over time."
503,CHAIR POWELL,"And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we’re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things."
505,CHAIR POWELL,"But right now, they’re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time."
506,CHAIR POWELL,And that may be—we don’t know how persistent that phenomenon will be.
507,CHAIR POWELL,It’s very hard to say.
508,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage–price spiral; is that something that’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system?"
509,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see that.
510,CHAIR POWELL,"You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level."
511,CHAIR POWELL,"But it comes back to, you know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply, March 16, 2022 particularly in the labor market."
512,CHAIR POWELL,And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.
513,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
514,CHAIR POWELL,And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market.
515,CHAIR POWELL,"We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy."
516,CHAIR POWELL,And the overall economy can as well.
517,CHAIR POWELL,"But, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it’s good to see that moving up."
518,CHAIR POWELL,But it wouldn’t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher.
519,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.
520,CHAIR POWELL,We expect to get more labor supply.
521,CHAIR POWELL,We did last time.
522,CHAIR POWELL,We got more than we expected during the last cycle.
523,CHAIR POWELL,"This time, we’ve gotten much less than expected."
524,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not easy to predict these things.
525,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do expect that we’ll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’s lives, something we all wish."
526,CHAIR POWELL,"But, so that’s how we think about it."
527,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
528,MICHELLE SMITH,"For the last question, we’ll go to Don Lee at the L.A. Times."
529,DON LEE,"Hi, Chair Powell."
530,DON LEE,"I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in hindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier."
531,DON LEE,And it sounds like today that you don’t think that the Fed is late.
532,DON LEE,"And, just wanted to get your clarification on that."
533,DON LEE,"And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is “behind the curve,” how much “behind the curve” is it?"
534,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
535,CHAIR POWELL,So we are not—we don’t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real-time decisions in the world.
536,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, so the question is—the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time?"
537,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now."
538,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think if we March 16, 2022 knew now—of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages, really, and the inflation Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes."
539,CHAIR POWELL,It would have been appropriate to move earlier.
540,CHAIR POWELL,"Obviously, it would be."
541,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, we don’t have that luxury."
542,CHAIR POWELL,"And then, so, but that’s a separate question from your other question, which is “behind the curve.” And, you know, I don’t have the luxury of looking at it that way."
543,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we are, we have our tools—powerful tools—and the Committee is very focused on using them."
544,CHAIR POWELL,We’re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market.
545,CHAIR POWELL,"And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that."
546,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched.
547,CHAIR POWELL,The costs of that would be too high.
548,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re not going to wait so long that we have to do that.
549,CHAIR POWELL,"No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down."
550,CHAIR POWELL,"So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate."
551,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate."
552,CHAIR POWELL,"And there’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP."
553,CHAIR POWELL,But thanks for your question.
554,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
555,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you all.
556,MICHELLE SMITH,"Thanks, Mr."
557,MICHELLE SMITH,Chair.
558,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
