0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,The pandemic continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship here in the United States and around the world.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"The most important response to this public health crisis has come from our health-care workers, and we remain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country."
3,CHAIR POWELL,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Many businesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to engage in various activities."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, household spending looks to have recovered about half of its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much less of a pickup."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record."
11,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market has followed a similar pattern.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one-third had been regained as of the June payroll report."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate declined in May and , 2020 June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL peak during the Global Financial Crisis."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the most affected."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
17,CHAIR POWELL,This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
18,CHAIR POWELL,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
19,CHAIR POWELL,"For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors—such as travel and hospitality—that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and, overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective."
21,CHAIR POWELL,Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges.
22,CHAIR POWELL,"After declining gradually from a peak near the end of April, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased sharply in many parts of the country since mid-June."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"We have thus entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Indeed, we have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses."
27,CHAIR POWELL,A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.
28,CHAIR POWELL,The path forward will also depend on policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
30,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
31,CHAIR POWELL,We have held our policy rate near zero since mid-March and have stated that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace."
34,CHAIR POWELL,These purchases are also fostering more accommodative financial conditions.
35,CHAIR POWELL,"The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job losses and income losses and worsening the downturn."
38,CHAIR POWELL,Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting the recovery.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not , 2020 otherwise available."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appear to have significantly increased the extension of credit from private lenders."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
43,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.
44,CHAIR POWELL,This week we extended these programs through the end of the year.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
47,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
48,CHAIR POWELL,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
49,CHAIR POWELL,"Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
52,CHAIR POWELL,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
53,CHAIR POWELL,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
54,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes."
55,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
56,CHAIR POWELL,"Before taking your questions, I’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy framework."
57,CHAIR POWELL,[Clears throat] Excuse me.
58,CHAIR POWELL,"As a reminder, we began this public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices—a first for the Federal Reserve—early last year."
59,CHAIR POWELL,"Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our , 2020 maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the generally lower level of interest rates around the world."
60,CHAIR POWELL,"As is evident in our current situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the economy by cutting interest rates."
61,CHAIR POWELL,"Our plans to conclude this review were, like so many things, delayed by the pandemic."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions."
63,CHAIR POWELL,Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
64,CHAIR POWELL,"This document states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions."
65,CHAIR POWELL,"While I do not have any details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progress and will wrap up our deliberations in the near future."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country."
67,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
68,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
69,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
70,CHAIR POWELL,I will look forward to your questions.
71,MICHELLE SMITH,James Politi.
72,JAMES POLITI,Hi there.
73,JAMES POLITI,James Politi with the Financial Times.
74,JAMES POLITI,"Chair Powell, the Fed today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the world."
75,JAMES POLITI,Why was that important for the Fed?
76,JAMES POLITI,And how concerned are you about dollar shortages persisting over time through the pandemic?
77,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so our—our dollar swap lines—we introduced those back at the beginning of—of this episode after the pandemic made itself present."
78,CHAIR POWELL,And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time.
79,CHAIR POWELL,"And the introduction of the swap lines has , 2020 really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity."
80,CHAIR POWELL,And Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL so they kind of served their purpose.
81,CHAIR POWELL,"But we extended them—I guess, yesterday morning—really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there."
82,CHAIR POWELL,We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed.
83,CHAIR POWELL,"And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from—from the pandemic are far from over, we’re going to leave those in place for the time being."
84,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll leave them in place until we’re confident that they’re no longer needed.
85,CHAIR POWELL,There’s nothing that’s going on in the market right now that raises any concerns.
86,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just, we want them to be there as a backstop for markets."
87,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
88,MICHELLE SMITH,Steve Liesman.
89,STEVE LIESMAN,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
90,STEVE LIESMAN,I hope that you can hear me.
91,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, given—you’ve said several times now that you have lending, not spending, powers."
92,STEVE LIESMAN,"Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really, barely used, do you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is now saying that money is limited and they shouldn’t take—they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill?"
93,STEVE LIESMAN,Is this money doing the best for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don’t seem to be being used all that much right now?
94,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
95,STEVE LIESMAN,"And I have a follow-up, sir."
96,CHAIR POWELL,So they—that—that’s really a question for Congress.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"They—they appropriated that money, and—$454 billion for our facilities, and it’s really a question for them."
98,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right that our facilities have not—we haven’t done as much lending as we thought.
99,CHAIR POWELL,"But, in very substantial measure, that’s because markets started working again fairly soon after , 2020 we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni—in the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL muni space, and also in the short-term funding facilities—the three of those that we set up."
100,CHAIR POWELL,So we didn’t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would.
101,CHAIR POWELL,"On the other hand, it’s important that the facilities stay in place, and that’s why we extended them yesterday."
102,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s important that they still stay in place until we’re, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us."
103,CHAIR POWELL,"So I—I can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it’s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there."
105,STEVE LIESMAN,Has any consideration—thank you.
106,STEVE LIESMAN,Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?
107,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"Not that I’m aware of, no."
109,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
110,MICHELLE SMITH,Nick Timiraos.
111,MICHELLE SMITH,"[No response] Nick, are you there?"
112,MICHELLE SMITH,[No response] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.
113,MICHELLE SMITH,[Aside] I didn’t hear you say that.
114,MICHELLE SMITH,"We’ll go to David Gura, NBC."
115,DAVID GURA,"Mr. Chairman, thank you very much."
116,DAVID GURA,No doubt you were paying attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from—from lawmakers.
117,DAVID GURA,And a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.
118,DAVID GURA,And something we’ve heard a lot is that they could be a disincentive to work.
119,DAVID GURA,Both of them addressed that.
120,DAVID GURA,I wonder if you would as well.
121,DAVID GURA,"And then, as a follow-up, I wonder what you’ve learned about the degree to which this has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are experiencing two different kinds of—of pandemics here."
122,DAVID GURA,Some are getting through this based on what they’ve saved and the jobs that they have.
123,DAVID GURA,Others are really struggling to get by.
124,DAVID GURA,"And I wonder what role—what additional role the Fed could have in, sort of, bridging that—that yawning gap."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on your first question, I wouldn’t want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"I just will say the following, that, you know, this—this pandemic and its fallout really represents the biggest shock to the U.S. economy in living memory."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we’ve had in 90 years, and we did it in the space of two months."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was strong, it was fast, it was broad—and appropriately so."
129,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we are seeing the results of the earlier strong fiscal actions.
130,CHAIR POWELL,"When you see the spending that’s happening, when you see small businesses staying in business even though the economy hasn’t fully, successfully, sustainably reopened yet in many places, you are seeing what happens with that—that money."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, in—in a broad sense, it’s been well spent."
132,CHAIR POWELL,It’s kept people in their homes.
133,CHAIR POWELL,It’s kept businesses in business.
134,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s all a good thing.
135,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more support from us and from more fiscal policy."
136,CHAIR POWELL,Fiscal policy is up to Congress.
137,CHAIR POWELL,You see the ongoing discussions that they’re having.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"And it suggests to me that there’s—you know, that both sides, they’re wrangling over—over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is a need for some additional fiscal support."
139,CHAIR POWELL,And the last thing I’ll say is that if the expansion—even if—sorry.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"Even if the reopening goes well and many, many people go back to work, it’s still going to take a fairly long time for the parts of the economy that are—that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"And that means that many of the people who were laid off from those industries—and that’s restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and accommodation—many of those people are going to find it hard to go back—they can’t go back to their old job."
142,CHAIR POWELL,There won’t be enough jobs for them.
143,CHAIR POWELL,So I think those people are going to need support.
144,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t say what the exact level should be.
145,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not our role.
146,CHAIR POWELL,"But they’re going to need support if they’re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or—or apartment or a house if they own it."
147,CHAIR POWELL,So I think there will be a need.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of inequality, really—so I think it’s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic have fallen on, heavily—they’ve fallen on everyone, but they’ve fallen very heavily on people who work in the service industries in relatively low-paying jobs."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"So there was a—a figure that came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, then 40 percent—you had a 40 percent chance of losing your job in April and May."
150,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s falling very heavily on—on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that."
151,CHAIR POWELL,And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women.
152,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s just what the pandemic is doing.
153,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, in terms of what we’re doing, what we’re trying to do is create an environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to their old job or to a new job."
154,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really what we’re doing.
155,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is directed at that.
156,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the—I would say—I would say one last thing on inequality."
157,CHAIR POWELL,"That is, inequality is a—is an issue—has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for four decades."
158,CHAIR POWELL,And you see it—it has many faces.
159,CHAIR POWELL,You see it in the relative flattening-out of—of incomes for people in low and—lower and middle incomes as compared to those at the top.
160,CHAIR POWELL,You see it in low mobility where people—where the chances of moving up from the bottom to the middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy countries.
161,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, four decades of evidence suggests it’s about globalization."
163,CHAIR POWELL,It’s about the flattening-out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor countries.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s about technology advancing, too."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"If you’re on the wrong side of those forces, it’s been—your income has stagnated."
166,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s—it’s a critical, critical problem for our society, but one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies."
167,CHAIR POWELL,Our part of it is to—is to push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.
168,CHAIR POWELL,We saw what happened to people at—at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion.
169,CHAIR POWELL,"It was the best labor market in 50 years, they told us."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"We saw that the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the—of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years of that 10-year, 8-month expansion."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed can foster to—to go after that—that problem, which is a—a serious one."
172,MICHELLE SMITH,"And now, Nick Timiraos."
173,NICK TIMIRAOS,Yeah.
174,NICK TIMIRAOS,[Inaudible] Journal.
175,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, you have described your asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets."
176,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And with markets having stabilized, aren’t the asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your , 2020 macroeconomic objectives?"
177,NICK TIMIRAOS,"The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward?"
178,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
179,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re right, the asset purchases in—in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic."
180,CHAIR POWELL,"And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets."
181,CHAIR POWELL,This is absolutely critical.
182,CHAIR POWELL,"That market is really one of the—it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets, and it’s—it’s essential that it—that it work well, and it is doing so now."
183,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve always said, though, that we understand, accept, and are fine with the fact that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s doing both, and—and, you know, we’ve understood that for some time."
185,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not—the programs are not structured exactly like the—the QE programs were in the last—in the last financial—in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.
186,CHAIR POWELL,Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities.
187,CHAIR POWELL,The current purchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum.
188,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions."
189,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s—it’s clear that that’s the case.
190,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"We—as you know, we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy."
192,CHAIR POWELL,We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"We—we ramped up asset purchases, and those—those have really helped."
195,CHAIR POWELL,"And we gave forward guidance on—on both of those things, which the markets appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with , 2020 those."
196,CHAIR POWELL,So we think we’re—we think that our—our policy stance is a good one.
197,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL course, prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to—to better foster achievement of our goals, of course."
198,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
199,MICHELLE SMITH,Jeanna.
200,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hi, Chair Powell."
201,JEANNA SMIALEK,Thank you for taking my question.
202,JEANNA SMIALEK,"You talked to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April, and May, according to your public calendars."
203,JEANNA SMIALEK,"I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about, and, if the topic of those conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of interest during those conversations?"
204,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so—so BlackRock is just our agent."
205,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues, and they just execute our—our plans."
206,CHAIR POWELL,"I actually don’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about, but he’s a—you know, he’s the head of a major service provider."
207,CHAIR POWELL,He generally checks in to find out whether we’re okay with the quality of the service that—that BlackRock is providing.
208,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or—or, as you can see, three phone calls in the course of a few months."
209,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn’t very many.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, I would have—I—I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they were—they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too—you know, generally exchanging information."
212,CHAIR POWELL,And he’s—he’s typically trying to make sure that—that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.
213,CHAIR POWELL,That’s—I’d say that’s his main objective when we talk.
214,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thank you."
215,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Scott Horsley.
216,SCOTT HORSLEY,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
217,SCOTT HORSLEY,Scott Horsley from NPR.
218,SCOTT HORSLEY,"I wonder if you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month and what, if anything, that tells us about the, sort of, economic circulatory system."
219,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
220,CHAIR POWELL,So—the situation with coins is that the—the quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic.
221,CHAIR POWELL,"The problem is, the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"It just—customers weren’t spending, they were—so the coins stopped moving in the system."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ve been working for—ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away."
224,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve been working to try to—try to reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins.
225,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re working with the U.S. Mint, which is the issuing authority, to address the issue."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"Just last week, the Mint—you may have seen—issued a statement asking for the public’s help in keeping coins circulating, and various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation."
227,CHAIR POWELL,"We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders—you know, banks and, you know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions, everybody in the—in the coin supply chain."
228,CHAIR POWELL,We’re in frequent communication with the banks and with the—with the armored carriers trying to get back to where we need to be.
229,CHAIR POWELL,So we do think the inventories are building up.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the Mint—the Mint is making coins as fast as they can, but—but, you know, things happen with—in the factory environment: Someone will come to work with COVID—I think this has happened in—in almost every factory environment around the country—and then they’ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing."
231,CHAIR POWELL,So—so we’re closely monitoring it.
232,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—you know, it’s a significant issue."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve—we’ve got a lot of resources on it, and we do feel like we’re—we’re making progress."
234,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thank you."
235,MICHELLE SMITH,Rachel Siegel.
236,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Hey, Chair Powell."
237,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thank you for taking my question.
238,RACHEL SIEGEL,"I’m wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double-dip recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stalling, compared to some of the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer."
239,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thanks very much.
240,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
241,CHAIR POWELL,So maybe I’ll talk more broadly about the—the outlook and include your—include your question in it.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because, I’d say, job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, and consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but, nonetheless, those were—those were sooner and stronger than we expected."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but what happened then was, along with that positive data, we got—we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"And that brings us to a new—a new point here, which is, we need to—in addition to dealing with the health crisis—we have to remember, this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus, and it’s taking a terrible toll, so we’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"So what we’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we—what we think of as sort of nonstandard, high-frequency data."
247,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do."
248,CHAIR POWELL,"And what that data show, on balance, is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June."
249,CHAIR POWELL,So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.
250,CHAIR POWELL,"Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses."
251,CHAIR POWELL,Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out.
252,CHAIR POWELL,"People aren’t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"Consumer surveys, by the way, , 2020 which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL they look like they may be softening again now."
254,CHAIR POWELL,There are still some areas of strength.
255,CHAIR POWELL,Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong.
256,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"But I want to stress, it’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"We just don’t know yet, because we have to wait for—to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment come in, and—but this—this is what we’re seeing, and, of course, we’re monitoring it very carefully."
259,CHAIR POWELL,And I’d be remiss in not stressing this enough.
260,CHAIR POWELL,The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check.
261,CHAIR POWELL,That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now.
262,CHAIR POWELL,The two things are not in conflict.
263,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together."
264,CHAIR POWELL,They’re not in competition with each other.
265,CHAIR POWELL,So— MICHELLE SMITH.
266,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
267,CHAIR POWELL,Chris Rugaber.
268,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Hi.
269,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Well, just to follow up on that a bit—and thanks for taking my question—you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus."
270,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Is this—do you feel this idea, or this view, is not widely enough understood?"
271,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Do you feel—you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an incautious reopening might harm the economy.
272,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,"Do you feel that message was not heard, and that some of these reopenings took place perhaps sooner than they should have?"
273,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think we feel that it—it might be, the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus."
274,CHAIR POWELL,And you’re seeing that again now.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"You saw that in the—during the lockdown when we got cases way down, and , 2020 you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"And now that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the—that the cases have spiked again—again, the early data, the high-frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now."
277,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know how deep or how long that will be.
278,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s such an important sentence.
279,CHAIR POWELL,We just decided that it needed to be in our—in our postmeeting statement.
280,CHAIR POWELL,It’s so fundamental.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think we can’t say it enough."
282,CHAIR POWELL,It’s—it’s really important.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re—you know, you can think of it as three stages."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we’ll get the data, I guess, later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"Then there was the reopening, and we would expect that many, many people would go back to work."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"Those whose jobs could be done without—you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups, they should have been—they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures."
288,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s where we are.
289,CHAIR POWELL,It’s such an important factor.
290,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—it’s in—we’re all talking about it, so we thought it really had to be in the statement."
291,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
292,MICHELLE SMITH,Mike McKee.
293,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering what it is—you’ve talked a lot about using all of your tools, and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to accommodation—what it is you can actually do."
294,MICHAEL MCKEE,You’ve lowered rates to zero.
295,MICHAEL MCKEE,You’ve set up the lending programs.
296,MICHAEL MCKEE,There hasn’t been much take-up.
297,MICHAEL MCKEE,"And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low, where they already are."
298,MICHAEL MCKEE,"So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed can bring."
299,MICHAEL MCKEE,", 2020 Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to—to add Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL additional help for it?"
300,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
301,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right.
302,CHAIR POWELL,"We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy at this difficult time, and we will always remain committed in that sense."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our credit and liquidity facilities, which are effectively unlimited."
304,CHAIR POWELL,We can adjust those programs.
305,CHAIR POWELL,We also can adjust our forward guidance.
306,CHAIR POWELL,We can adjust our asset purchases.
307,CHAIR POWELL,So there are things that we can do.
308,CHAIR POWELL,We—we feel like we have the ability to do more.
309,CHAIR POWELL,But I would not disagree with the—with the importance of fiscal policy—with your statement about the importance of fiscal policy.
310,CHAIR POWELL,Fiscal policy can do—can address things that we can’t address.
311,CHAIR POWELL,"If there are particular groups that need help, that need direct monetary help—not a loan, but an actual grant as the PPP program showed—you can save a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer."
312,CHAIR POWELL,The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can’t work because there’s no business.
313,CHAIR POWELL,"So lending is a particular tool, and we’re using it very aggressively."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say, again, Congress’s action early in the pandemic—historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. standards—it’s really helping now."
315,CHAIR POWELL,It’s really helping.
316,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going to stand up very well to—to scrutiny down the years.
317,CHAIR POWELL,"This Congress’s very fast and very open-handed response, I think, has really helped."
318,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think—I know that, as I’ve said, very likely more will be needed from—from all of us, and I see Congress negotiating now over—over a new package, and I think that’s a good thing."
319,MICHELLE SMITH,Okay.
320,MICHELLE SMITH,Edward Lawrence.
321,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
322,EDWARD LAWRENCE,So you talked about it several times today: The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy is linked to the path of the virus.
323,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October or towards the end of the year."
324,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Has the Committee talked about how that might change Fed policies?
325,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"And, as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be?"
326,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Thank you.
327,CHAIR POWELL,"So we—of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions."
328,CHAIR POWELL,Of course it does.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"But I have to say, you know, we’re—our job is not to plan for the upside case, right?"
330,CHAIR POWELL,The upside case—we’ve got that covered.
331,CHAIR POWELL,Our job is to plan for all—the full range of things that could happen.
332,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we’re assuming—we’re going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed, and that the public needs—you know, needs the support that we’re giving the public until—until shown otherwise."
333,CHAIR POWELL,There’s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines.
334,CHAIR POWELL,"All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can’t plan on that."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve got to hope for the worst—hope for the [laughs]—hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of inflation, I don’t know."
337,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I—you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"I know there—there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time, but, you know, we’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent."
340,CHAIR POWELL,And I do think for quite some time we’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.
341,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
342,MICHELLE SMITH,Ann Saphir.
343,ANN SAPHIR,Hi.
344,ANN SAPHIR,"Yes, thanks for taking my question."
345,ANN SAPHIR,"So, I mean, as you monitor the rising infections and the slowing pace of the recovery, could you speak to, what would the trigger be for doing further easing?"
346,ANN SAPHIR,"And on the flip side of that, when would it be reasonable to expect the Fed to consider raising rates again?"
347,ANN SAPHIR,Thanks.
348,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, as we’ve said, we’re carefully monitoring the situation."
349,CHAIR POWELL,"We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we’ve been monitoring the situation."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a good place."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"But we’ve looked at—at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we’re ready to do that when we think it’s appropriate."
352,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t give you a specific trigger.
353,CHAIR POWELL,It really just is when we think it would help: Would it help more than what we’re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices?
354,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, your second question was?"
355,CHAIR POWELL,[Inaudible] I can’t hear you.
356,CHAIR POWELL,Say it again?
357,ANN SAPHIR,Sorry—for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider raising— CHAIR POWELL.
358,ANN SAPHIR,Oh.
359,ANN SAPHIR,—rates again.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"So as I—as I said earlier, or a while back, we’re not even thinking about—thinking about raising rates."
361,CHAIR POWELL,We’re—we’re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need.
362,CHAIR POWELL,We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.
363,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re absolutely committed to staying in this until—until we’re very confident that that is no longer needed.
364,CHAIR POWELL,So I wouldn’t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time.
365,CHAIR POWELL,We’re—we’re in this until—until we’re well through it.
366,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think this—you know, I think the picture is, you have the—you have the lockdown, then you have the reopening."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"But there’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work because those—those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged, really, to employ the millions of people who are now out of work."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s going to take a while, I think, in everyone’s reckoning."
370,CHAIR POWELL,And I just—everyone should know that we’re going to be there for all of that.
371,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
372,MICHELLE SMITH,Catarina with Bloomberg.
373,CATARINA SARAIVA,"Hi, Chair."
374,CATARINA SARAIVA,Thanks for taking our questions.
375,CATARINA SARAIVA,"You mentioned earlier that the labor market we had in February was the best we’ve had in 50 years, yet at that point the Black unemployment rate was still double that of whites."
376,CATARINA SARAIVA,"So I wanted to ask you, you know, we’ve seen some economists and even the Biden campaign call for the Fed to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates."
377,CATARINA SARAIVA,"Even if you don’t get a mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going forward?"
378,CATARINA SARAIVA,And how would you do that?
379,CATARINA SARAIVA,And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm’s writings from last night.
380,CATARINA SARAIVA,She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed—described harassment and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to.
381,CATARINA SARAIVA,Is this your Federal Reserve?
382,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
383,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first, on the unemployment, you’re right."
384,CHAIR POWELL,And we always point this out in our—in our remarks.
385,CHAIR POWELL,"While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent, every—every economy—every market in every economy has longer-run issues."
386,CHAIR POWELL,And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between—between Blacks and whites.
387,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s generally sort of twice as much—twice as high for Blacks.
388,CHAIR POWELL,"So even—but this was the lowest, , 2020 you know, Black unemployment rate in 50 years—or, actually, since we started keeping records, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL which was less than 50 years ago."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s just a fact, and it’s—it’s not a good fact, you know."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have started, though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment—for example, among—among different racial groups and demographic groups."
391,CHAIR POWELL,We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.
392,CHAIR POWELL,We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress.
393,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do."
394,CHAIR POWELL,So what does that mean?
395,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally."
396,CHAIR POWELL,"But it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years—it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits."
397,CHAIR POWELL,So we need more than that.
398,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re—we’re going to get back there as fast as we can, because that’s what we can do, but society more broadly can affect these things."
400,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don’t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy."
401,CHAIR POWELL,"And just policy generally—education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that."
402,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of—so we do—you will see that—you will see that discussed—the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.
403,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we clearly understand now that it’s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market.
404,CHAIR POWELL,It’s something that you want to be focused on and weigh.
405,CHAIR POWELL,"So it is very much in our thinking—again, in a world where we don’t really have the best tools to address that."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"So, something that we’re doing."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"So I have not seen that—I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this."
409,CHAIR POWELL,"So, but—and I will take a , 2020 look at it."
410,CHAIR POWELL,I will do that.
411,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I—without having had a chance to think about it, read Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL it, understand it, I’ll just say a couple things."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"First, I think it’s fair to acknowledge that there’s been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace—not just among economists, but among economists and at the Fed."
413,CHAIR POWELL,That’s been going on for far too long.
414,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have done more and—and should have done more."
415,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, though, that we—you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can."
416,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.
417,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we want a place where it’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully."
418,CHAIR POWELL,I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"And I—my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations—the really successful organizations in our society get this."
420,CHAIR POWELL,They do.
421,CHAIR POWELL,"They—mostly, they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you—you’re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce, so—and workplace."
422,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ve made diversity a priority.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"We actually—you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"We had the—the two heads of the AEA task force on this—who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—come here, and I cohosted a—an event with them, I guess, last year or the year before, which had several hundred—500 people or something like that listening in about—about these issues."
425,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re doing a lot.
426,CHAIR POWELL,I’m sure we can do more.
427,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re doing a lot to—you know, to foster a respectful climate—particularly for women, but for—for all people."
428,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s—it’s a very high priority for us as an organization.
429,CHAIR POWELL,"I will look into—into that and—when I—you know, when this is over."
430,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thank you."
431,MICHELLE SMITH,Don Lee.
432,DON LEE,"Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and new hiring activity has weakened."
433,DON LEE,"I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?"
434,CHAIR POWELL,"So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we’re watching this high-frequency data."
435,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, the official labor market reports come out once a month, and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’re going to say."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"They’ve been, in May and June, stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say, some humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going."
438,CHAIR POWELL,"I think all we can say today is that there’s—there’s evidence in the high-frequency data, the surveys, and, you know, you’re tracking—you get pictures of spending."
439,CHAIR POWELL,You get pictures of people’s movements.
440,CHAIR POWELL,And what we—it looks like we’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.
441,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—and that might be—it might be short lived, it might not be, you know."
442,CHAIR POWELL,And it seems to be related to—and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June.
443,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, I really don’t want to get ahead of where the data are on this."
444,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re just going to have to see.
445,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that question.
446,CHAIR POWELL,And recent experience suggests we—we need to wait and see.
447,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, there’s clearly a risk that we’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring."
448,CHAIR POWELL,It might still be at a robust level.
449,CHAIR POWELL,"Honestly, we—we will not know until we start to see more data come in."
450,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
451,MICHELLE SMITH,Victoria Guida.
452,VICTORIA GUIDA,Hi.
453,VICTORIA GUIDA,Victoria Guida with Politico.
454,VICTORIA GUIDA,Thanks for taking my question.
455,VICTORIA GUIDA,I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities.
456,VICTORIA GUIDA,"You all have used your emergency authority to buy assets that you can’t directly buy, like corporate bonds, ETFs."
457,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So I was just wondering, what is the scope of your authority under 13(3)?"
458,VICTORIA GUIDA,What type of assets are you allowed to buy?
459,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Could you buy equities through an SPV, for example?"
460,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we haven’t—we haven’t looked at that, and we have no—no intention."
461,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t done any work or thought about buying equities.
462,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we—we’re bound by the—by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities—programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning we have to have—it can’t just be focused on one entity."
463,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it has to be a broad group of entities."
464,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a lot in 13(3) about—about the solvency of the borrowers.
465,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was—that was to—meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions."
466,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and things like that."
467,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we have to meet those requirements."
468,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we haven’t looked and said—tried to say, “What can we buy?” and, you know, “Let’s make a complete list.” You know, we felt that, using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and municipal bonds, too."
469,CHAIR POWELL,So— VICTORIA GUIDA.
470,CHAIR POWELL,"So I just—sorry, just to follow up really quickly."
471,CHAIR POWELL,"So is it—is it generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments, since you talked about borrowers?"
472,CHAIR POWELL,"The statute doesn’t say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want."
473,CHAIR POWELL,"Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit , 2020 of it."
474,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think, clearly, it’s—it’s supposed to—it’s supposed to replace lending, you know."
475,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL That’s—that’s really what you’re doing.
476,CHAIR POWELL,You’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the market has stopped functioning.
477,CHAIR POWELL,That’s fundamentally what you’re doing with 13(3).
478,CHAIR POWELL,And—and so I think you’ve got to—you’ve got to sort of work within that framework.
479,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
480,MICHELLE SMITH,Greg Robb.
481,GREG ROBB,Hi.
482,GREG ROBB,Thanks for taking my question.
483,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
484,GREG ROBB,Can you hear me?
485,GREG ROBB,Okay.
486,GREG ROBB,"One of the things in this crisis that’s unusual is that companies are cutting wages and salaries, and that’s something, you know, we haven’t seen much."
487,GREG ROBB,And I was wondering what the Fed is thinking about this.
488,GREG ROBB,It—it seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming—coming months and coming years.
489,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I—I think that the main thing that tells you is that the—the labor market has a long way to go to recover."
490,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we had a good labor market."
491,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn’t perfect.
492,CHAIR POWELL,There were always issues.
493,CHAIR POWELL,There are always going to be issues within an economy.
494,CHAIR POWELL,But the labor market really has a long way to go now.
495,CHAIR POWELL,Even with two very strong months of job creation—7½ million jobs between the two months—we still have 14 million people unemployed.
496,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s just—it’s a long way to go.
497,CHAIR POWELL,"And as—and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened."
498,CHAIR POWELL,"So there aren’t, you know—until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can go back to work, but—so it’s a tough situation."
499,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ve read reports of that.
500,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, of course, the reported wages went up because of the composition effect—you know, it’s low-paid workers didn’t go back to work, so—they were the ones that got laid off—so average hourly earnings went up."
501,CHAIR POWELL,"But clearly, clearly the pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate , 2020 level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work."
502,CHAIR POWELL,And the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL main—so it just underscores again the—the urgency of doing everything we can to restore the labor force and—and to support those who are—who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster.
503,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
504,MICHELLE SMITH,Jean Yung.
505,JEAN YUNG,"Hi, Chair Powell."
506,JEAN YUNG,Thank you very much.
507,JEAN YUNG,I wanted to ask about forward guidance.
508,JEAN YUNG,Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes?
509,JEAN YUNG,And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?
510,JEAN YUNG,"And specifically, for the labor market, what conditions would you want to see before you think about pulling back stimulus?"
511,JEAN YUNG,Thank you.
512,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a great discussion that we—we’ve talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven’t made any decisions yet on that."
513,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, you’ve got a couple ways to go."
514,CHAIR POWELL,You can tie—you can tie them to dates.
515,CHAIR POWELL,"You can say we will—for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level."
516,CHAIR POWELL,Or you can say we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal.
517,CHAIR POWELL,"And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out."
518,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that, you know, there’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons."
519,CHAIR POWELL,"You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes."
520,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s also the case, though, that sometimes—sometimes date-based guidance works too."
521,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it really is very fact specific, and it’s not something we’ve—you know, we haven’t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’t be standing here telling you we’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to—to change our forward guidance."
522,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you.
523,MICHELLE SMITH,Hannah.
524,HANNAH LANG,"Hi, Chair Powell."
525,HANNAH LANG,Thanks for doing this today.
526,HANNAH LANG,"I wanted to ask, on the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they’ve said that they’re weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks."
527,HANNAH LANG,"Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed’s stress tests showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery, that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements?"
528,CHAIR POWELL,So—okay.
529,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think what the stress tests showed is that, under the “regular way” stress test, the banks passed."
530,CHAIR POWELL,But right in the middle of the—of the stress test came the pandemic.
531,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios, which were, you know, really bad scenarios."
532,CHAIR POWELL,"And many of the banks passed, but some didn’t."
533,CHAIR POWELL,So we—and that was done very quickly.
534,CHAIR POWELL,"So we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can—that says there’s been a material change, and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans."
535,CHAIR POWELL,We also stopped buybacks—share buybacks and limited dividends.
536,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re working through the details of how all of that will work.
537,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the—the stress scenarios on September 30th.
538,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I would say, that’s—you know, that—that process is working that way."
539,CHAIR POWELL,"And—but you’re making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix."
540,CHAIR POWELL,"So what’s going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our—we have found our banks are strong."
541,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity."
542,CHAIR POWELL,And they’ve really been a source of strength in this—in this crisis so far.
543,CHAIR POWELL,And they’ve written off bad loans and things like that.
544,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re still well capitalized and strong and will be, I think, a source of strength in this situation."
545,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but what—what we did earlier was, we—what happens is, the banks run up against their leverage ratio, which is a non-risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the balance sheet."
546,CHAIR POWELL,"So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks, and they reached the limit of how—how much they could grow or made loans—you know, they—companies drew down loans and deposited cash."
547,CHAIR POWELL,"So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily—it’s temporary relief—by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the—of the leverage ratio."
548,CHAIR POWELL,This is a—this is another additional thing to do.
549,CHAIR POWELL,"If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary."
550,CHAIR POWELL,"We—in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards."
551,CHAIR POWELL,"We haven’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and, in doing so, to serve their customers better."
552,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators—many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief."
553,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada did, we did."
554,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—it’s not, it’s not—what it’s doing is, it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers."
555,CHAIR POWELL,That—that’s really what it’s doing.
556,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if—if we do do it."
557,MICHELLE SMITH,"Okay, thank you."
558,MICHELLE SMITH,We’ll go to Brian Cheung for the last question.
559,BRIAN CHEUNG,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
560,BRIAN CHEUNG,Thanks so much.
561,BRIAN CHEUNG,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
562,BRIAN CHEUNG,I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your discussion on explicit forward guidance.
563,BRIAN CHEUNG,"So is the idea that you’re trying to have some order to that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed review before then committing to some sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy?"
564,BRIAN CHEUNG,Thanks.
565,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I do think that completion of the review would—first of all, it’s something that was a very high priority for—we were really looking forward to completing it, probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that."
566,CHAIR POWELL,"We were right on track, and then we got distracted."
567,CHAIR POWELL,"I—and we weren’t expecting the pandemic, of course."
568,CHAIR POWELL,Nobody was.
569,CHAIR POWELL,So the pandemic came in.
570,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it is important to go back and finish that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward."
571,CHAIR POWELL,"I would also tell you, though, that, to—to a very large extent, the—the changes we’ll make to the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are really codifying the way we’re already acting with our policies."
572,CHAIR POWELL,"To a large extent, we’re already doing the things that are—that are in there."
573,CHAIR POWELL,This is just a way of—of acknowledging that and putting them in the document.
574,CHAIR POWELL,"I can’t tell you what the exact timing of that will be, but I do think that’s a—that’s a sensible way to think about it."
575,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks very much.
576,MICHELLE SMITH,Thank you very much.
