0,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be happy to respond to your questions."
2,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal."
3,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to 1¾ percent.1 This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now."
4,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force."
5,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher."
6,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged."
7,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong."
8,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderated early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid."
9,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months."
10,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Several factors are supporting the outlook: Fiscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
11,CHAIRMAN POWELL,1 Chairman Powell intended to say that the Committee had raised the target “range” for the federal funds rate.
12,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
13,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in January."
14,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period."
15,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago."
16,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term."
17,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation."
18,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At times it may be above 2 percent, just as at times it may be below."
19,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.
20,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median projection for the growth of inflation-adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate."
21,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The median projection for unemployment—for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
22,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020."
23,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher."
24,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion March 21, 2018 continues."
25,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"This gradual process has been under way for more than two years, and it has Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL served—and should continue to serve—the economy well."
26,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
27,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In the Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals."
28,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion."
29,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future."
30,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Participants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our gradual approach.
31,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020."
32,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run trend."
33,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Most participants revised up their projections since December, although the median projection for this year did not change."
34,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December.
35,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and price stability objectives."
36,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately."
37,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Finally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly."
38,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the outlook, we do not intend to alter this program."
39,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
40,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions March 21, 2018 were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the federal funds rate."
41,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now."
42,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman—right, the microphone."
43,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, welcome."
44,STEVE LIESMAN,Interesting changes in the forecast.
45,STEVE LIESMAN,"A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven-tenths below the long run, and yet very little change in inflation."
46,STEVE LIESMAN,What does that say about what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic?
47,STEVE LIESMAN,"And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year—and I sense there’ll be three next year—and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?"
48,STEVE LIESMAN,Where's your biggest concern here?
49,STEVE LIESMAN,Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill?
50,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question."
51,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation."
52,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent."
53,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s now 4.1 percent.
54,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.
55,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.
56,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But, it has diminished, but it’s still there."
57,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will."
58,STEVE LIESMAN,"And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here—is it doing too much, doing too little?"
59,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I think we’re trying to, we’re trying to be, to take the middle ground there."
60,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too March 21, 2018 long, and then we have to raise rates quickly, and that foreshortens the expansion."
61,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL want to do that.
62,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The—on the other side, if we—if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward."
63,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent."
64,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path."
65,NICK TIMIRAOS,Thanks.
66,NICK TIMIRAOS,I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
67,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations."
68,NICK TIMIRAOS,I want to understand what symmetry means in the context of inflation being allowed to run above the 2 percent target now that that’s part of the projection for—at least for core PCE next year.
69,NICK TIMIRAOS,How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years?
70,NICK TIMIRAOS,Would the Fed be willing to accept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot?
71,NICK TIMIRAOS,And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric?
72,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾?"
73,NICK TIMIRAOS,"And also, for how long?"
74,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below."
75,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’ve also said—in minutes and in speeches and things like that—that that is a symmetric objective.
76,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, that’s how we think of it."
77,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation."
78,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We were always pushing toward 2 percent, and I think that is how we look at it."
79,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I can’t give you an exact number.
80,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It just, you know, it, we haven’t agreed on that."
81,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent March 21, 2018 inflation."
82,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And in doing that, we’re going to be considering, by the way, the other side of the Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL mandate."
83,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from—unemployment from its goal."
84,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And—and also, just the duration of it as well."
85,JIM PUZZANGHERA,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
86,JIM PUZZANGHERA,Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.
87,JIM PUZZANGHERA,"Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then—this year—and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020."
88,JIM PUZZANGHERA,Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bringing growth to 3 percent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact?
89,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, let me say what that really is."
90,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.
91,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The Committee made really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
92,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.
93,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent."
94,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I would—and that’s an interesting statistic.
95,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.
96,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The full range is interesting.
97,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So you have a range of views around the table.
98,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views, and so we discuss these things."
99,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So the Committee doesn’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you’re going to have a range of views."
100,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’s really all I can say—2.7 just happens to be the median for ’18, but it doesn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible."
101,JIM PUZZANGHERA,But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis?
102,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth."
103,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It March 21, 2018 would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL get there."
104,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg News."
105,JEANNA SMIALEK,"So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU estimates slightly today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether you’re actually overshooting full employment?"
106,JEANNA SMIALEK,"And, if you start to question that, how is that going to impact policy?"
107,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.
108,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We look at a wide range of indicators on that—you know, 15 or 20 of them at least."
109,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands."
110,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point."
111,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So the Committee—and, I think, people—are generally influenced by data."
112,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation."
113,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I don’t think we, we—we’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we’ll be looking at that."
114,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that."
115,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation."
116,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that."
117,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’ll be alert to that.
118,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained March 21, 2018 period, you would see an acceleration of inflation."
119,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we would know that then, and we’re very Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL alert to it, but it’s not something we observe at the present."
120,SAM FLEMING,Thanks very much.
121,SAM FLEMING,Sam Fleming from Financial Times.
122,SAM FLEMING,You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.
123,SAM FLEMING,"Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?"
124,SAM FLEMING,"And second question—this is obviously your first press conference, so it’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more often?"
125,SAM FLEMING,Thanks.
126,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow-moving forces over time."
127,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So they don’t—they don’t move around very much.
128,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So I wouldn’t expect the Committee’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly."
129,CHAIRMAN POWELL,They’ll move slowly.
130,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expansion?"
131,CHAIRMAN POWELL,There’s literature that says that.
132,CHAIRMAN POWELL,There’s—there are reasons that that might be the case.
133,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In fact, it did tick up one-tenth, as you all know, in the—in the median at this time."
134,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But it’s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will."
135,SAM FLEMING,And press conferences?
136,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Ah, press conferences."
137,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s something that I’m going to be carefully considering.
138,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I have not made a decision about it.
139,CHAIRMAN POWELL,My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.
140,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more March 21, 2018 frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy."
141,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And so, it is something that I’ll be Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL thinking about."
142,ADAM SHAPIRO,Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network.
143,ADAM SHAPIRO,"You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it’s having, and I was curious, how is the change in the federal budget deficit—because the stimulus is coming with great debt—has it changed your approach to how many securities you’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll-off, given how much the U.S. government’s going to have to borrow going forward?"
144,ADAM SHAPIRO,"And, then a second question, things beyond your control—the President is expected to announce new tariffs against China, and does the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation?"
145,ADAM SHAPIRO,And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that?
146,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, in terms of the balance sheet, we’ve said that, you know, we carefully developed this plan."
147,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.
148,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates."
149,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I have no inclination to revisit that.
150,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy."
151,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was, first, that there’s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook."
152,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in—about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group."
153,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.
154,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,You talked about the fact that the Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the members of the FOMC.
155,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that was impacted by the—we had a $1½ trillion tax cut, we’ve had $300 billion in increased government spending—the staff forecast that you’re working with, are those reflected—how were they impacted by that?"
156,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,And how did that impact the discussions?
157,CHAIRIMAN POWELL,"So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts—and, by the way, there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work—we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers."
158,CHAIRIMAN POWELL,"So—and it’s really the policymakers’ views that we talk about in the SEP. We don’t—we don’t, you know, talk about the staff forecast."
159,CHAIRIMAN POWELL,It’s a particular thing under—done under particular rules and circumstances.
160,CHAIRIMAN POWELL,"And, really, it’s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their forecasts, which are what drive policy."
161,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"That had no impact, though?"
162,MARTIN CRUTSINGER,"It’s such a—that’s a major increase in government stimulus that you’re—that had to have had an impact on the discussions, I would think, though."
163,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Well, the—you’re right."
164,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So fiscal stimulus is a, you know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year."
165,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections—as their projections."
166,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Those are not the staff’s projections.
167,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Those are our projections.
168,HEATHER LONG,"Heather Long, Washington Post."
169,HEATHER LONG,I—what will it take to get to four rate hikes this year?
170,HEATHER LONG,"It’s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back."
171,HEATHER LONG,Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect?
172,HEATHER LONG,Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise?
173,HEATHER LONG,Can you give us some more insight into why people didn’t go to four this time—the median—even though the economic projections look very healthy?
174,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting, and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
175,CHAIRMAN POWELL,The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled.
176,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, you’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close, but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they’ll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes."
177,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s really all I can say.
178,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It could change up.
179,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It could change down.
180,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I wouldn’t want to—for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make, and, you know, it could be that if the economy’s a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual."
181,HEATHER LONG,So it wasn’t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the discussion?
182,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Not, no."
183,JIM TANKERSLEY,"Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question."
184,JIM TANKERSLEY,"On trade, what would have to happen in policy—and, in particular, in potential retaliation from countries around the world—for trade policy to become a concern for the Committee’s outlook?"
185,JIM TANKERSLEY,"And then, the second question is, you mentioned productivity growth March 21, 2018 earlier."
186,JIM TANKERSLEY,"What’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL policy—any policy change in recent months changed that assessment?"
187,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns, which were relatively new, about—about future trade actions, really."
188,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And they’re seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing.
189,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So—and the kind of things people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing."
190,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I can’t be any more specific than that.
191,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis."
192,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess."
193,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So that’s well below, you know, longer-run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up."
194,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively."
195,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity."
196,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.
197,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation."
198,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.
199,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed, but, you know, we’re certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill."
200,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.
201,JONATHAN SPICER,"Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters."
202,JONATHAN SPICER,"I take your caveats on the dot plot, as it were, but I’ll ask another question."
203,JONATHAN SPICER,"In 2020, it shows that policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3½ percent, which is quite a ways—or, March 21, 2018 definitively, anyways—above the neutral rate."
204,JONATHAN SPICER,Does that increase the risk of a Fed-induced Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing?
205,JONATHAN SPICER,"Which is asking, in a way, about the fiscal policy."
206,JONATHAN SPICER,"And, as a follow-up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the Fed around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of “low rates” environment?"
207,JONATHAN SPICER,Thanks.
208,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, I would say that—remember that forecasts three years out—so, you’re right, in 2020 there’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that’s three years in the future."
209,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s highly uncertain.
210,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we don’t have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn’t put a lot in that."
211,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It could make sense.
212,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’t put too much on that."
213,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Sorry, your second question was?"
214,JONATHAN SPICER,The second question was whether the secular stagnation narrative—whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that?
215,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth."
216,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate."
217,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation."
218,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t know how big those effects are going to be.
219,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We don’t know what March 21, 2018 the timing would be."
220,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think, as you look around the table at the FOMC, there’s a wide range of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL views on the amount and the timing of those."
221,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think all of us would agree that we hope that they will be large.
222,MICHAEL DERBY,Hi.
223,MICHAEL DERBY,Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.
224,MICHAEL DERBY,I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.
225,MICHAEL DERBY,I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on excess reserves and reverse repo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates—or do you want to shift back to the old way of doing things at some point of targeting the fed funds market?
226,MICHAEL DERBY,"And do you have any concern that if you do stick with the current system that, as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under—is being criticized for paying out ever larger shares of money to banks to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money?"
227,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Sure.
228,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.
229,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We have excellent control over rates, and it’s working."
230,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And it’s—you described it accurately.
231,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We haven’t made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework.
232,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We haven’t really addressed that question.
233,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ve had meetings where we’ve talked about it, and we’ve agreed that it’s working well."
234,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But it’s—and it’s not something I see us as needing to urgently address.
235,CHAIRMAN POWELL,I think we’re continuing to learn about this framework.
236,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves."
237,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those."
238,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So it’s not something we’re looking at resolving in the near term.
239,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it’s a little bit of a misnomer to think that there’s a subsidy there."
240,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We pay interest on excess reserves.
241,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We can’t pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.
242,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.
243,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In addition, remember that those liabilities—those are our liabilities."
244,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which yield much higher than interest on reserves."
245,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, in fact, it’s not a subsidy, and it’s not a cost to the taxpayer."
246,GREG ROBB,Over here.
247,GREG ROBB,"Thank you, Chairman."
248,GREG ROBB,Thank you very much.
249,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
250,GREG ROBB,Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances.
251,GREG ROBB,I was wondering if you could give us your view on the asset markets.
252,GREG ROBB,Are—do you see any bubbles?
253,GREG ROBB,"And do you have the tools you need, you think, to combat those?"
254,GREG ROBB,Thank you very much.
255,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Since the financial crisis, we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let’s say."
256,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that.
257,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital."
258,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You see much higher liquidity.
259,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing.
260,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And if one—if something does go wrong, you’ve got—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions."
261,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, therefore, you don’t see high leverage."
262,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You don’t see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see March 21, 2018 before the crisis."
263,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL condition."
264,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you look at nonfinancial corporations, you see—you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks."
265,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, of course, default rates are very low."
266,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So those readings look okay.
267,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I should mention also that for large financial institutions, they’re no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly, so they’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues."
268,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability."
269,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices."
270,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms."
271,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You can think of some equity prices.
272,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets.
273,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"But we don’t see it in housing, which is key."
274,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities, in our view."
275,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we certainly—we use them."
276,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We have—I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.
277,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions."
278,VICTORIA GUIDA,Hi.
279,VICTORIA GUIDA,Victoria Guida with Politico.
280,VICTORIA GUIDA,"More on the regulatory side, you know, the Fed might soon be getting more power to decide exactly which regulations—which stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets."
281,VICTORIA GUIDA,And so I had a couple of questions about that.
282,VICTORIA GUIDA,"So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that’s based around, you know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict dividend payouts or stock buybacks, is there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don’t have CCAR every year for certain banks?"
283,VICTORIA GUIDA,Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis?
284,VICTORIA GUIDA,"And then, my other question is, you know, you’ve talked a lot about how size isn’t the only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering, what other factors do you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk?"
285,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Okay.
286,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration."
287,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s not something—so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to—from $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it’s appropriate."
288,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, we haven’t been shy about doing that, because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already."
289,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So we are fully prepared to do that.
290,CHAIRMAN POWELL,But this is a decision that’s in the hands of Congress.
291,CHAIRMAN POWELL,It’s not something that’s been—been taken.
292,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have—did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically, as opposed to annually, is the language."
293,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We haven’t made any decision about that at all.
294,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We would want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever we do decide to do, we’d put that out for comment."
295,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Is it, you know, logistically possible?"
296,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I would think it would be, but it’s certainly not something that we’ve decided to do."
297,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And the second question you had was?
298,VICTORIA GUIDA,About what causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size.
299,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Sure.
300,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Well, it’s—I guess the next thing on the list would be activities."
301,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model."
302,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?"
303,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s what they do.
304,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"They’re speculating on markets, and—you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing."
305,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, that’s—that would be the next thing on the list."
306,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I mean, there March 21, 2018 would be a range of things, you know—how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL things."
307,MICHAEL MCKEE,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
308,MICHAEL MCKEE,I’d like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you’re getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?
309,MICHAEL MCKEE,"You use words like “might” and “should” about what results should come from this process, but, around the table, did any of the presidents or Governors report that businesses are actually getting ready to spend?"
310,MICHAEL MCKEE,Is this something that’s going to happen?
311,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Do we know that there’s going to be a supply-side effect, or are you just guessing at this point?"
312,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants, and we—each of us has his or her own forecast."
313,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So there’s a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues."
314,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years."
315,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time."
316,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it."
317,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s uncertain, though."
318,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing—and, you know, the cost of capital is one of many factors that they’ll consider."
319,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity."
320,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"At the same time, the—you know, I mentioned labor supply."
321,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.
322,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The whole thing is very March 21, 2018 uncertain, and particularly the supply-side effects should and would be expected to take longer to Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appear and would be less certain in amount."
323,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s really as good as you can go.
324,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And, you know, we’ve all looked at the literature carefully."
325,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We’ve all thought about it.
326,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"We’ve discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views, and they’re disparate, but that’s—I’d say that’s about where the—where the views are."
327,DONNA BORAK,"Hi, Chair Powell."
328,DONNA BORAK,Donna Borak with CNN.
329,DONNA BORAK,"Just to go back to trade policy, if you don’t mind."
330,DONNA BORAK,"You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn’t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussion—if there are fears about inflationary effects, should there be trade barriers imposed?"
331,DONNA BORAK,"And, secondly, you know, we might be on the verge of a tit-for-tat trade war with China."
332,DONNA BORAK,Wondering what your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic—the global economic outlook going forward should that occur.
333,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed—it wasn’t—it was—it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low-profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook."
334,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That’s really what people were saying.
335,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be."
336,CHAIRMAN POWELL,So that’s not something that did come up.
337,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know—your second question, sorry, was China?"
338,DONNA BORAK,Yes.
339,DONNA BORAK,"I mean, in the event that the United States and China—in the event that the U.S. and China end up in a tit-for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed and are you worried about."
340,CHAIMRAN POWELL,That didn’t—it’s not something that came up in particular.
341,CHAIMRAN POWELL,"And, let me say, you know, we don’t do trade policy here at the Fed, and, you know, I would be reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country."
342,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
343,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?
344,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER,Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now?
345,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages."
346,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases."
347,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.
348,CHAIRMAN POWELL,And productivity’s been very low.
349,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Inflation’s been low.
350,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So these low wage increases—in a sense, they do make sense in that—from that perspective."
351,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more."
352,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"And I would—I think I’ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well."
353,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"In terms of what’s the right level, I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages."
354,VIRGINIE MONTET,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
355,VIRGINIE MONTET,"If the economy behaves as the Fed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be—keep on rising, and the prime rate will be above—well above 5 percent, a level not reached in 10 years for what is a base of consumer credit."
356,VIRGINIE MONTET,"And we know that, historically, raising rates—especially March 21, 2018 in campaign times—has never been very popular in the White House."
357,VIRGINIE MONTET,Does this prospect of a Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night?
358,CHAIRMAN POWELL,No.
359,CHAIRMAN POWELL,That doesn’t keep me awake at night.
360,CHAIRMAN POWELL,We don’t consider the election cycle.
361,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus."
362,CHAIRMAN POWELL,You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.
363,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You’re right, that’s the highest rate."
364,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"By the way, I’m hearing this, the 10-year thing a few times these days, and it’s true that rates are higher than they’ve been in 10 years."
365,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"On the other hand, the economy’s healthier than it’s been since—since before the financial crisis."
366,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"So, it’s a healthier economy than it’s been in 10 years."
367,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago."
368,MYLES UDLAND,Thanks.
369,MYLES UDLAND,"Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance."
370,MYLES UDLAND,"Chair Powell, I’m curious if the Fed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve."
371,MYLES UDLAND,"We continue to see the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year tighten, even with longer-term yields coming up since the beginning of the year."
372,MYLES UDLAND,"This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we’re likely to see shorter-term rates come up as the Fed continues to increase rates."
373,MYLES UDLAND,"So, I’m just curious if you guys have discussed that, if you’d be willing to push back against that, or if that’s a dynamic you’d be comfortable with?"
374,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"You know, it’s an interesting question, and there are a range of views there."
375,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession."
376,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"That’s really not the situation we’re in now, so I don’t know that that’s—I don’t know that—I don’t think that March 21, 2018 recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are."
377,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL But, having said that, I think it’s—there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or inverted yield curve does to intermediation."
378,CHAIRMAN POWELL,"It’s hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we’ll be watching carefully."
379,CHAIRMAN POWELL,Thank you very much.
