0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes."
5,CHAIR POWELL,I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic, including travel and leisure."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"With COVID case counts receding further and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, and demand for workers remains very strong."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education."
17,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September.
18,CHAIR POWELL,"This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued."
19,CHAIR POWELL,Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements.
20,CHAIR POWELL,"But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings."
22,CHAIR POWELL,These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains in employment and economic activity.
23,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics."
25,CHAIR POWELL,The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
26,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal."
28,CHAIR POWELL,Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly November 3, 2021 connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic—specifically, the effects on supply and Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation."
31,CHAIR POWELL,Our tools cannot ease supply constraints.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that, as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain."
35,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"If we were to see signs that the path of inflation, or [of] longer-term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability."
37,CHAIR POWELL,We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
38,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
39,CHAIR POWELL,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
40,CHAIR POWELL,They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
41,CHAIR POWELL,"Last December, the Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our November 3, 2021 maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee judged that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"We also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-December, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to our December FOMC meeting."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook."
47,CHAIR POWELL,"And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions."
48,CHAIR POWELL,Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy.
49,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.
50,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
51,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
52,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.
53,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
54,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
61,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say it this way.
62,CHAIR POWELL,"We try to focus on what we can control—and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, how we’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent, where the economy evolves in unexpected ways."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals, measured from last December."
65,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that, as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"And as that happens, inflation will decline from today’s elevated levels."
69,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain."
70,CHAIR POWELL,"But, certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter."
71,CHAIR POWELL,The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy.
72,CHAIR POWELL,We think we can be patient.
73,CHAIR POWELL,"If a response is called for, we will not hesitate."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what I will tell you is, we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately."
75,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what I would say.
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at the progress that we’ve made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be: “Yes, I do think that that is possible.” Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, in real terms, they’ve been—they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasing."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation."
90,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s very important, and it’s generally a good thing."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and cause companies to—or employers, really—to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage–price spiral."
92,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t have evidence of that yet.
93,CHAIR POWELL,Productivity has been very high.
94,CHAIR POWELL,The ECI reading is just one reading.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, if you look back, November 3, 2021 we—so we’ll be watching this carefully."
96,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would say that, at this point, we don’t see Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL troubling increases in wages."
97,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t expect those to emerge, but we’ll be watching carefully."
106,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
110,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, so, you know, this isn’t the traditional Phillips curve situation where there’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we’re talking about."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"The inflation that November 3, 2021 we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market."
112,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s due to bottlenecks, and it’s due to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL shortages, and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those."
113,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it’s not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff.
114,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
115,CHAIR POWELL,So we used to call that the “balanced approach” paragraph.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"We have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are in tension."
117,CHAIR POWELL,It’s very difficult.
118,CHAIR POWELL,But what it really boils down to is something that’s common sense.
119,CHAIR POWELL,And that is risk management.
120,CHAIR POWELL,We have to be aware of the risks that we’re—particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation.
121,CHAIR POWELL,"We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to—should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term inflation."
123,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what we think our policy is doing now.
124,CHAIR POWELL,It’s putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess, as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we’re prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook."
132,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be.
133,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we’ll communicate very transparently and openly about that."
134,CHAIR POWELL,But I’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here."
139,CHAIR POWELL,We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it’s warranted by changes in the economic outlook.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, if we feel like something like that’s happening, then we’ll be very transparent about it."
141,CHAIR POWELL,We wouldn’t want to surprise markets.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it or not do it."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"But so—but I’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today."
144,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
153,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
154,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first of all, it is our job to—and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term."
155,CHAIR POWELL,We’re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability.
156,CHAIR POWELL,The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned."
158,CHAIR POWELL,So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.
159,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, so—which it’s doing now."
161,CHAIR POWELL,So “transitory” is a word that people have had different understandings of.
162,CHAIR POWELL,"For some, it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s, you know, there’s a real time component—measured in months, let’s say."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, for us, what “transitory” has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “transitory.” We said “expected to be transitory,” first of all, to show uncertainty around that—we’ve always said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people."
165,CHAIR POWELL,And then we added some language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three.
166,CHAIR POWELL,"We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said, “Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in November 3, 2021 economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.” So we’re trying to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory.” So it’s, I mean, it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible."
167,CHAIR POWELL,"Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs—when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes."
168,CHAIR POWELL,We understand completely what they’re going through.
169,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t become a permanent feature of life."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment."
171,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s our commitment.
186,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
188,CHAIR POWELL,You can’t specify a specific goal.
189,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment—levels of employment—[and] participation are a part of that."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"But, in addition, there are other measures of what’s going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is—the level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"So we look at so many different things, and you make an overall judgment."
192,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that’s the goal because we didn’t know any—that’s what we knew."
193,CHAIR POWELL,We knew that was achievable in a context of low inflation.
194,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’re in a, you know, we’re learning that."
195,CHAIR POWELL,"We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very, you know, COVID-affected, by the way."
196,CHAIR POWELL,A lot of what we’re seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta.
197,CHAIR POWELL,We were on a path to a very different place.
198,CHAIR POWELL,Delta put us on a different path.
199,CHAIR POWELL,And we see these things.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"But, so I think we’re going to have to—ideally, we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn’t another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and] because of fear of COVID to a significant extent."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply."
204,CHAIR POWELL,"That doesn’t seem to have been the case, interestingly."
205,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think there’s room for a whole lot of humility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be."
206,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to November 3, 2021 have to see some time post-COVID so that we know—or post-Delta, anyway—to see what is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL possible."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that, over time, you can get to places that didn’t look possible."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, what we also have now, though, is, we have high inflation."
209,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what’s going on in the employment market."
210,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year."
219,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a decision for the Committee.
220,CHAIR POWELL,I would put it to you this way.
221,CHAIR POWELL,"When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what’s going on, but, you know, we’re not at maximum employment."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"When that is the case, we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"What I’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we had the question on when to taper."
227,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve now answered that question and the speed of it and all that.
228,CHAIR POWELL,"We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment."
229,CHAIR POWELL,"What I’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be, let’s say we do meet the maximum-employment test."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of the Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Yes, it’s been met.” But we’re not asking that question today, because we’re not running a liftoff test."
232,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not evaluating the liftoff test today.
233,CHAIR POWELL,We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting.
234,CHAIR POWELL,"We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"So we don’t actually define maximum employment as—we define it in terms of inflation, but, of course, there is a connection there."
244,CHAIR POWELL,Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices.
245,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not really how we think about it.
246,CHAIR POWELL,We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.
247,CHAIR POWELL,"You can’t just look at—unlike inflation, where you can have a number."
248,CHAIR POWELL,"But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation, hypothetically, where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"And so you wouldn’t really be at maximum employment, because there’s this group that isn’t counted as unemployed."
250,CHAIR POWELL,So we look at a range of things.
251,CHAIR POWELL,"So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight labor market."
252,CHAIR POWELL,I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things.
254,CHAIR POWELL,"Because you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’re holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID, or, for whatever reason, they’re staying out."
255,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s clear that there are, you know—with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we’re set up to go back to a higher job-creation rate."
256,CHAIR POWELL,So that would suggest that you’re not at maximum employment.
257,CHAIR POWELL,"So, at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that’s consistent with price stability."
261,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
262,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, again, it’s a risk-management thing."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not—I can’t reduce it to an equation, but, ultimately, it’s about risk management."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"So you want to be in a position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"And in this case, the risk is skewed."
266,CHAIR POWELL,"For now, it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"So we need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be."
268,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
269,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, though, that, judgmentally, too, it’s appropriate to be patient."
270,CHAIR POWELL,It’s appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further.
271,CHAIR POWELL,"We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"And Delta stopped, it stopped job creation."
273,CHAIR POWELL,It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there’s excess demand for goods because there—services are not available.
274,CHAIR POWELL,People are not traveling.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation."
277,CHAIR POWELL,Bottlenecks should be abating.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"We start to see that now with some of them, but, overall, they haven’t gotten better overall, and, you know, we’re very aware of that."
279,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.
280,CHAIR POWELL,We’re thinking that time will tell us more.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, we don’t think it’s time to raise rates now."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, if we do conclude that it’s necessary to do so, then we’ll be patient, but we won’t hesitate."
292,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.
293,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a decision for elected representatives.
294,CHAIR POWELL,So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think we have a role in climate change.
295,CHAIR POWELL,"It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates are, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"We expect them, and the public will expect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s physical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate."
298,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that’s right within our mandate."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, from that standpoint, we can do research."
301,CHAIR POWELL,We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk.
302,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do."
303,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll do it well.
304,CHAIR POWELL,"Within the frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well."
305,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change.
306,CHAIR POWELL,"That has to be elected people, and not so much us."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, you know, we—let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case."
317,CHAIR POWELL,And so we had no moment of denial about that.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took."
319,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their interest all the time—absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency."
320,CHAIR POWELL,And I feel like this called that into question.
321,CHAIR POWELL,"So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully."
322,CHAIR POWELL,"If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them."
323,CHAIR POWELL,So you asked me about blind trusts.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE."
325,CHAIR POWELL,And they have a long-held position which is not favorable to blind trusts.
326,CHAIR POWELL,They do not encourage them.
327,CHAIR POWELL,They don’t think they’re effective.
328,CHAIR POWELL,They think they’re cumbersome.
329,CHAIR POWELL,And they think there are better ways to get at the things that need to be done.
330,CHAIR POWELL,And those are the things that we’re actually doing.
331,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t know that there are any blind trusts, for that reason, because they are the, they’re the regulator."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"They say this on their website, if you look."
333,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of laws broken, you know, I November 3, 2021 asked the inspector general to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL were laws broken, and I won’t speculate on that."
334,CHAIR POWELL,"But that is with the inspector general now and, of course, out of my hands."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so, let me say what’s happened—and we’re very, very straightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they’re now on track to persist well into next year."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"That was not expected—not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, let me say, you know, it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"When you’re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it’s a whole different thing."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don’t have a lot of experience with this."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have to set policy, though."
347,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what we’re doing.
348,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’t think that we’re behind the curve."
349,CHAIR POWELL,"I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible November 3, 2021 outcomes, and that’s what we need to do."
350,CHAIR POWELL,I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.
351,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL That’s not—I don’t think that’s controversial.
352,CHAIR POWELL,"Certainly, I don’t know anyone arguing for that today."
353,CHAIR POWELL,And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment.
354,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think, although it’s been delayed, clearly, there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID."
355,CHAIR POWELL,That’s when we’re really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.
356,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we’re seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly, now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports—those things are going to work themselves out."
357,CHAIR POWELL,We have a flexible economy.
358,CHAIR POWELL,"It’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed to create a vaccine faster than, certainly, than I expected."
359,CHAIR POWELL,And I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"That is my baseline understanding, and that’s a very widely held one among people."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment."
362,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to let the data lead us to where we need to go.
363,CHAIR POWELL,Our policy will adapt—and has already adapted—to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply-side story—which is also partly a demand story.
364,CHAIR POWELL,So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back in, I guess it was, 2013."
372,CHAIR POWELL,We were much farther away from maximum employment.
373,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation was much lower.
374,CHAIR POWELL,"This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people."
375,CHAIR POWELL,"So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013, where we still had quite a ways to go."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is quite a different situation, and, you know, the Committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we’d articulated, and this was appropriate."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"And this is faster than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s earlier and faster, and that’s because our, as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it’s clarifying itself, and that’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher—so."
386,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
387,CHAIR POWELL,"So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention—we haven’t gone back to them."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"Now that we’ve tapered, I expect that that’s exactly November 3, 2021 what we’ll do in coming meetings."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we’ll talk about Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL reinvestment and all those things."
390,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t have to make decisions on those yet.
391,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, typically, when we’re doing a new subject like that, we’ll have a series of briefings and discussions."
392,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what we will now begin to do.
393,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this."
394,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, you can kind of—you can find different people coming out with different views."
396,CHAIR POWELL,There are two ways.
397,CHAIR POWELL,"One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically."
398,CHAIR POWELL,So you can give forward guidance.
399,CHAIR POWELL,"You can say, we’re going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met."
400,CHAIR POWELL,"The markets will do the math, and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing."
401,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s one thing.
402,CHAIR POWELL,"The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those securities, buy longer-term securities."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers."
404,CHAIR POWELL,"So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity."
405,CHAIR POWELL,People—you can service your debt.
406,CHAIR POWELL,You have more free cash flow.
407,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s not different from what we do at the short end."
408,CHAIR POWELL,So that was discussed long before anybody did it.
409,CHAIR POWELL,"That was—I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"So, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it’s quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"But most people November 3, 2021 find—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expect, which is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag."
414,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that’s the main finding I would say on QE.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’m not going to—I won’t have any—I will answer your question, Paul, but I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and I’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction."
422,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, this is—part of my job is—Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously."
423,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you’re on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I’m in regular contact with you, probably."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone."
425,CHAIR POWELL,I’m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have.
426,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s November 3, 2021 just part of my job."
427,CHAIR POWELL,So I do that.
428,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t talk about particular conversations.
429,CHAIR POWELL,But you can Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL assume I’ll always do that.
430,CHAIR POWELL,And I certainly did it in this case.
437,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now.
438,CHAIR POWELL,"We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and what structural things may need to be done."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there’s a lot going on."
441,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not sure when that report will be out.
442,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s work under way.
443,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other ideas."
444,CHAIR POWELL,It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market.
445,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers."
446,CHAIR POWELL,So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.
493,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all.
494,CHAIR POWELL,"I just, I’m not going to give you any names, so don’t take that as a “yes” or “no.” I’m just not going to start down that road."
502,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
503,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages."
505,CHAIR POWELL,So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents.
506,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting."
507,CHAIR POWELL,"There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means."
508,CHAIR POWELL,"So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire."
509,CHAIR POWELL,So maybe this was just catch-up on that.
510,CHAIR POWELL,"I am a believer that, over time, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance."
511,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over again."
512,CHAIR POWELL,"There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is."
513,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be November 3, 2021 humble about what the limits are of labor force participation."
514,CHAIR POWELL,But we expect labor force Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL participation to pick up.
515,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know the pace at which it will do so.
516,CHAIR POWELL,"So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history."
517,CHAIR POWELL,"There was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor market."
518,CHAIR POWELL,We’re in a different world now.
519,CHAIR POWELL,This is a—it’s just very different.
520,CHAIR POWELL,"The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest."
521,CHAIR POWELL,And wages didn’t really go down.
522,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support]."
523,CHAIR POWELL,All of this is completely unusual.
524,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century."
525,CHAIR POWELL,So you ask about full employment.
526,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more and more."
529,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000."
530,CHAIR POWELL,So if you think of that as a stronger—you don’t have to think back to the million-job months of June and July.
531,CHAIR POWELL,"You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get back on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course."
532,CHAIR POWELL,"So November 3, 2021 we’ll know so much more."
533,CHAIR POWELL,"And, believe me, we understand."
534,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a different world in so many Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL ways.
535,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re very open to that.
538,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
