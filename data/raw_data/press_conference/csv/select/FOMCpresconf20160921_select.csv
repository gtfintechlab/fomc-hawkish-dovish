0,CHAIR YELLEN,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR YELLEN,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee discussed overall economic conditions and decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent."
2,CHAIR YELLEN,We judged that the case for an increase has strengthened but decided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives.
3,CHAIR YELLEN,Our current policy should help move the economy toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.
4,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’ll have more to say about our decision shortly, but first I will review recent economic developments and the outlook."
5,CHAIR YELLEN,"Economic growth, which was subdued during the first half of the year, appears to have picked up."
6,CHAIR YELLEN,Household spending continues to be the key source of that growth.
7,CHAIR YELLEN,This spending has been supported by solid increases in household income as well as by relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.
8,CHAIR YELLEN,"Business investment, however, remains soft, both in the energy sector and more broadly."
9,CHAIR YELLEN,"The energy industry has been hard hit by the drop in oil prices since mid-2014, and investment in that sector continued to contract through the first half of the year."
10,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, drilling is now showing signs of stabilizing."
11,CHAIR YELLEN,"Overall, we expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years."
12,CHAIR YELLEN,"Turning to employment, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month over the past four months, about the same solid pace recorded since the beginning of the year."
13,CHAIR YELLEN,"In the longer run, that’s well above the pace that we estimate is needed to provide work for new entrants in the job market."
14,CHAIR YELLEN,"But so far this year, most measures of labor market slack have shown little change."
15,CHAIR YELLEN,The unemployment rate in August—4.9 percent—was the same as in January.
16,CHAIR YELLEN,And a broader measure of unemployment has also flattened out—a measure that includes people who want and are available to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time but would rather work full time.
17,CHAIR YELLEN,"The fact that unemployment measures have been holding steady while the number of jobs has grown solidly shows that more people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs."
18,CHAIR YELLEN,"This is a very welcome development, both for the individuals involved and the nation as a whole."
19,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to expect that labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further over time.
20,CHAIR YELLEN,Ongoing economic growth and an improving job market are key factors supporting our inflation outlook.
21,CHAIR YELLEN,"Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was less than 1 percent over the 12 months ending in July, still short of our 2 percent objective."
22,CHAIR YELLEN,Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy and import prices.
23,CHAIR YELLEN,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more volatile than other prices, has been running about 1½ percent."
24,CHAIR YELLEN,"As transitory influences holding down inflation fade and as the job market strengthens further, we continue to expect inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years."
25,CHAIR YELLEN,Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
26,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, we can’t take the stability of longer-run inflation expectations for granted, and we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
27,CHAIR YELLEN,"Indeed, we are fully committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective."
28,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me turn to the economic projections—now extending through 2019—that were submitted for this meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee participants.
29,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own view of appropriate monetary policy, which in turn depends on each participant’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
30,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, is 1.8 percent this year."
31,CHAIR YELLEN,This figure is somewhat lower than projected in June as a result of the weaker-than-expected growth seen in the first half of the year.
32,CHAIR YELLEN,"In 2017 and 2018, the median growth projection is unchanged at 2 percent, somewhat higher than the median estimate of longer-run normal growth."
33,CHAIR YELLEN,"In 2019, growth edges down to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer-run rate, which has als—which has been revised down a bit since June."
34,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent at the end of this year, a touch higher than in June."
35,CHAIR YELLEN,"Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs near 4½ percent, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
36,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.3 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
37,CHAIR YELLEN,"Returning to monetary policy, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the federal funds rate."
38,CHAIR YELLEN,"Moreover, the Committee judges the risks to the outlook to be roughly balanced."
40,CHAIR YELLEN,Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy.
41,CHAIR YELLEN,"Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, and we expect that to continue."
42,CHAIR YELLEN,"And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time."
43,CHAIR YELLEN,"But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives."
44,CHAIR YELLEN,"This cautious approach to paring back monetary policy support is all the more appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that we can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future by raising rates than to a weakening labor market and falling inflation by cutting rates."
45,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain our objectives.
46,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currently quite low by historical standards."
47,CHAIR YELLEN,"With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives."
48,CHAIR YELLEN,"But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years."
49,CHAIR YELLEN,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
50,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent by the end of 2019."
51,CHAIR YELLEN,"Compared with the projections made in June, the median path for the federal funds rate has been revised down ¼ to ½ percentage point."
52,CHAIR YELLEN,"Most participants also marked down their estimate of the longer-run normal federal funds rate, with the median now at 2.9 percent."
53,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I have noted on previous occasions, participants’ projections for the federal funds rate, including the median path, are not a fixed plan for future policy."
54,CHAIR YELLEN,Policy is not on a preset course.
55,CHAIR YELLEN,"These forecasts represent participants’ individual assessments of appropriate policy, given their projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors at a particular point in time."
56,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and any assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks."
57,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities."
58,CHAIR YELLEN,"As our statement says, we anticipate continuing this policy “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.” Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock."
59,CHAIR YELLEN,Thank you.
60,CHAIR YELLEN,I’d be happy to take your questions.
66,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ll try to respond to those questions.
67,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me try to set out again how the Committee sees the economy and what we’re looking for.
68,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing.
69,CHAIR YELLEN,Growth was weak in the first half of the year; we’re seeing definite evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.
70,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I mentioned, payroll gains in recent months have been solid, averaging around 180,000 per month, which is less than the pace in 2015, but, as I mentioned, it’s well above what’s needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor force over time."
71,CHAIR YELLEN,The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium value.
72,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, as I mentioned, that rate and other measures of labor utilization are little changed since the beginning of the year."
73,CHAIR YELLEN,"I don’t see that as bad news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the labor force back into employment."
74,CHAIR YELLEN,The labor force participation rates increased on balance since late last year.
75,CHAIR YELLEN,"It has—it is on a declining demographic trend, and the fact that it’s increased shows a substantial number of people are being attracted into the labor market."
76,CHAIR YELLEN,The employment-to-population ratio has also continued to increase.
77,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, we were not really certain that this is something that would happen as the labor market strengthened, and it’s good to see that development has taken place."
78,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that is some news that we’ve received in recent months, that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in without the unemployment rate coming down."
79,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we’re not seeing strong pressures on utilization suggesting overheating, and my assessment would be, based on this evidence, that the economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought."
80,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s good news.
81,CHAIR YELLEN,"Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up over time."
82,CHAIR YELLEN,So the Committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced.
83,CHAIR YELLEN,We expect labor market conditions to continue strengthening.
84,CHAIR YELLEN,And we are generally agreed that gradual increases in the federal funds rate to remove what is a modest degree of accommodation will be appropriate.
85,CHAIR YELLEN,But we don’t see the economy as overheating now.
86,CHAIR YELLEN,My colleagues and I exchanged views at this meeting on the appropriate timing of the next step in reducing policy stimulus.
87,CHAIR YELLEN,"Most of us judged that the case for an immediate increase in the federal funds rate is stronger, but that it would be sensible, given the finding of a bit more running room, to wait to see some continued progress—evidence that we continue to progress toward our objectives."
88,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, for the time being, we’re going to watch incoming evidence, and you can see from the SEP that most participants do expect that one increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this year."
89,CHAIR YELLEN,And I would expect to see that if we continue on the current course of labor market improvement and there are no major new risks that develop and we simply stay on the current course.
95,CHAIR YELLEN,"So it is true that our estimates of the neutral rate are coming down, and that’s what’s largely responsible for that shift."
96,CHAIR YELLEN,"At the same time, we generally agree that the stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative."
97,CHAIR YELLEN,"So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than is sustainable in the longer run."
98,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, we have seen people come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn’t fallen."
99,CHAIR YELLEN,But that’s probably not something that is possible without the economy overheating on an indefinite basis.
100,CHAIR YELLEN,So policy needs to be forward looking.
101,CHAIR YELLEN,We don’t want the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective.
102,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s one risk that we need to address.
103,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think we generally agree that some gradual increases to remove that accommodation will be appropriate if we stay on this course.
104,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, as I emphasized, it’s not that much accommodation, and the economy has shown evidence that there are more people who are being attracted back into the labor force."
105,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in that sense, I would characterize it as, we found the economy has a bit more running room."
106,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, we don’t want the economy to overheat, and if things continue on the current course, I think that some gradual increases will be appropriate."
107,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, mainly, what we discussed today were issues affecting the timing of such increases."
115,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I did say at Jackson Hole that I thought the case for a rate increase had strengthened, and that assessment is included in today’s statement."
116,CHAIR YELLEN,So I think most of my colleagues agree—agree with that assessment.
117,CHAIR YELLEN,I think we are trying to understand some difficult issues.
118,CHAIR YELLEN,"There is less disagreement among participants in the Committee than you might think, listening to speeches and commentary."
119,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run."
120,CHAIR YELLEN,"We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal, and that we want to make sure we stay on a course that raises that to 2 percent."
121,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we’re struggling with a difficult set of issues about what is the “new normal” in this economy and in the global economy more generally, which explains why we keep revising down the rate path."
122,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, you know, it’s very important that in a body like ours that a whole range of views are expressed, that we have independent-minded people who gather together and discuss these issues."
123,CHAIR YELLEN,"My colleagues do explain, in their individual speeches, their own perspectives."
124,CHAIR YELLEN,"These are complicated, complex issues, and it just isn’t straightforward exactly how to interpret what is appropriate policy and exactly what is going on in the economy."
125,CHAIR YELLEN,My—my sense is that market participants and the public more generally learn more about the issues that we’re grappling with as they listen to this set of speeches.
126,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think it’s a very good thing that the FOMC is not a body that suffers from groupthink.
127,CHAIR YELLEN,"And you see that—you see that’s one of the, you know, real worries in an organization, that everybody thinks identically."
128,CHAIR YELLEN,"But there’s a lot that we share in common and express, both in our statement and in our speeches."
129,CHAIR YELLEN,And we are debating and discussing issues pertaining to timing.
135,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I think Congress very wisely established the Federal Reserve as an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short-term political pressures."
136,CHAIR YELLEN,And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
137,CHAIR YELLEN,We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as affecting the outlook.
138,CHAIR YELLEN,"We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions."
139,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I said, we’re generally pleased with the progress of the economy."
140,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the decision not to raise rates today and to wait for some further evidence that we’re continuing on this course is largely based on the judgment that we’re not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating, and that we are seeing evidence that people are being drawn in—in larger numbers than at least I would have expected—into the labor market, and that that’s healthy to continue, but that, nevertheless, we do need to be forward looking."
141,CHAIR YELLEN,"And if we continue along this course, it likely will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate."
142,CHAIR YELLEN,And November you asked about as well.
143,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, every meeting is live, and we will again assess, as we always do, incoming evidence in November and decide whether or not a move is warranted."
151,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecasts, revising down our estimates, well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know, if you saw this, you would see revisions in the funds rate path."
152,CHAIR YELLEN,"But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated, if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had increased."
153,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that, while the economy has made a lot of progress, it’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of time."
154,CHAIR YELLEN,"Let’s see, and then you asked about global factors."
155,CHAIR YELLEN,"So global factors, capital flows— CRAIG TORRES."
156,CHAIR YELLEN,—about the global reach-for-yield and whether the Committee saw that as a cost to its accommodative policy right now.
157,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in most advanced nations now, we have highly accommodative policies, and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and employment objectives."
158,CHAIR YELLEN,And that’s characteristic of a—an environment in which the neutral rate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.
159,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield as individuals and investors seek to, perhaps, take on risk or lengthen maturities to seek higher—to seek higher yields."
160,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability risks.
161,CHAIR YELLEN,And we are very aware that those are possible.
162,CHAIR YELLEN,We engage in regular assessments of financial stability factors that bear on financial stability.
163,CHAIR YELLEN,"Overall, I would say that the threats to financial stability I would characterize, at this point, as moderate."
164,CHAIR YELLEN,"Not—I mean—so, I would characterize it as moderate."
165,CHAIR YELLEN,"In general, I would not say that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but there are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on: commercial real estate, where price-to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low."
166,CHAIR YELLEN,And that’s something that has caught our attention.
167,CHAIR YELLEN,We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks.
168,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ve recently issued new supervisory guidance pertaining to commercial real estate.
169,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices."
170,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, more generally, we’re not seeing signs of leverage building up or maturity transformation in the way that we saw in the run-up to the crisis, and we’re keeping a close eye on it."
179,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, starting with the issue of political uncertainty and investment, investment spending really has been quite weak for some time, and we’re really not certain exactly what is causing that."
180,CHAIR YELLEN,"Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spending extends beyond—beyond that sector, and I’m not certain of exactly what explains that, whether—I’m not aware of evidence that suggests that it’s political uncertainty, but it certainly—I would agree with the finding that it has been weak."
181,CHAIR YELLEN,Consumer sentiment is perfectly solid.
182,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’re seeing a lot of strength in consumer spending, and consumer sentiment certainly seems to be solid."
183,CHAIR YELLEN,You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.
184,CHAIR YELLEN,I was careful in Jackson Hole.
185,CHAIR YELLEN,I indicated we have a number of tools that we’ve used before and could use again.
186,CHAIR YELLEN,I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.
187,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, at this point our balance sheet is large, and we’re not at what we see as the normal level—longer-run level of interest rates."
188,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, at the moment, the funds rate is very low."
189,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s below that normal level.
190,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, at the moment, I would say the zero lower bound is a concern, and we have less scope than I would like to see or expect us to have in the longer run."
191,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, I think it would be—it would be worthwhile for other policymakers to think about what role they could play in addressing negative shocks should they come."
192,CHAIR YELLEN,And I mentioned specifically automatic stabilizers because I think that’s an important way in which fiscal policy serves to cushion shocks to the economy.
193,CHAIR YELLEN,"And it would seem to me, without getting into specifics, that there are ways in which the response of fiscal policy to shifts in the economy could be strengthened, which would help take some burden off monetary policy."
200,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we are very focused on evaluating, given the way the economy is operating, what is the right policy to foster our goals, and I’m not going to get into politics."
201,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’m just—those are factors that we don’t consider, and I don’t—I’m not going to get involved in commenting on the election."
202,CHAIR YELLEN,"In terms of the dissents, as I indicated, the notion that we do have some accommodation, that if we continue on the current path, it’s something we will need to remove over time."
203,CHAIR YELLEN,"There’s general agreement among participants on that, but the precise timing of what is the right—what is the right timing for removing that accommodation is something on which we had active discussions, and there are a range of opinions."
204,CHAIR YELLEN,And the dissents represent a judgment on the part of some of my colleagues that it’s important to begin that process now.
205,CHAIR YELLEN,"I certainly agree, and I’ve said myself, that there are risks in waiting too long to remove accommodation, and we need to take a forward-looking approach."
206,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ve always advocated making policy based on forecasts of where the economy is heading and taking account of risks.
207,CHAIR YELLEN,And there are two particular risks that we need to think about and balance.
208,CHAIR YELLEN,"One is the risk that the economy runs too hot, that unemploy—the labor market tightens too much, that unemployment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that, because that is a very difficult thing to accomplish, to gently create a bit more slack in the labor market, we could cause a recession in the process."
209,CHAIR YELLEN,And so that’s something my colleagues and I certainly wouldn’t want to be responsible for.
210,CHAIR YELLEN,"We would all like to have a very long expansion, with the labor market operating well for many years to come, and the prospect that we could create—create downside risk for the labor market is something we would like to avoid, and taking “a stitch in time” might be essential to avoiding that."
211,CHAIR YELLEN,"On the other hand, inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, and it’s also important that we make sure we get back to 2 percent."
212,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I have routinely indicated a number of measures of inflation expectations that are running at the low ends of their historical range, and we’re watching that as well."
213,CHAIR YELLEN,And there would also be risks from not seeing inflation move back to our 2 percent objective.
214,CHAIR YELLEN,"And exactly how to balance these two risks, which is more serious—which is a more serious risk—can affect one’s judgment about the appropriate timing, and we’re all struggling to understand the magnitude and nature of those two risks."
217,CHAIR YELLEN,The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised.
218,CHAIR YELLEN,We do not discuss politics in our meetings.
219,CHAIR YELLEN,I can’t recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion.
220,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think the public, if they had been watching our meeting on TV today, would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy, and we struggled mightily with trying to understand one another’s points of view and to come out at a balanced place and to act responsibly."
221,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that’s my commitment to the American people, that I want to lead an institution that is not political and is—that we are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has assigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment."
223,CHAIR YELLEN,"I have no concern that the pol—the Fed is politically motivated, and I will assure that you will not find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are released in five years."
224,CHAIR YELLEN,"We—I—it is important that we maintain the confidence of the public, and I do believe that we deserve it."
225,CHAIR YELLEN,"I know that these are difficult decisions, and everybody may not agree with them, but I hope the public will understand that we’re striving to do our best to pursue these goals that do matter to all of us."
229,CHAIR YELLEN,Yes.
230,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, we—we are worried that bubbles could form in the economy, and we routinely monitor asset valuations."
231,CHAIR YELLEN,"While nobody can know for sure what type of valuation represents a bubble—that’s only something one can tell in hindsight—we are monitoring these measures of valuation, and commercial real estate valuations are high."
232,CHAIR YELLEN,"Rents have moved up over time, but, still, valuations are high relative to rents."
233,CHAIR YELLEN,And so it is something we’ve discussed.
234,CHAIR YELLEN,We called this out in our Monetary Policy Report and in other presentations.
235,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we are—we are, in our supervision with banks, as I indicated, we have issued supervisory guidance to make sure that underwriting standards are sound on these loans, and we’re aware—this is something also that we look at in stress tests of the large—the larger banks to see what would happen to their capital positions and to make sure that they hold sufficient capital."
236,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, of course, I think the soundness and state of the banking system has improved substantially, but, of course, we are focused on such things."
243,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in this specific case, the abuses that occurred took place in a national bank."
244,CHAIR YELLEN,The Comptroller of the Currency has responsibility there.
245,CHAIR YELLEN,"And on the consumer side, it is the CFPB that has responsibility, but we work cooperatively and closely with those organizations."
246,CHAIR YELLEN,"And in terms of our overall supervisory responsibility for Wells and other large banking organizations, we are very focused, and this will be a particular focus of our supervision going forward over the next year or so on the compliance environment to make sure that the controls, that the senior management oversight, that the involvement of the boards of directors are appropriate to control these kinds of risks."
247,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have been distressed to see banking organizations responding when a particular problem arises, and what we’d really want to see is robust procedures that ensure that employees are always acting in a legal and ethical manner, and that the incentives that are put in place in these organizations are appropriate and don’t serve to foster behavior that could harm the public."
248,CHAIR YELLEN,And this has been and will be a focus of our supervision.
253,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, you know, that’s a political issue that’s currently being debated that I really don’t want to get into."
254,CHAIR YELLEN,"You know, so—I’m going to—I’m going to pass on that one."
261,CHAIR YELLEN,So we have high expectations for what we expect to be in place in a large organization or in any banking organization.
262,CHAIR YELLEN,"We expect there to be robust systems of risk management, strong audit functions, a board of directors that is monitoring and supervising and holding senior management accountable for things that happen throughout the organization in a strong compliance environment, and I don’t think that these are impossible standards to meet."
263,CHAIR YELLEN,"They may be challenging, but I wouldn’t at this point arrive at the conclusion that just because an organization is large, it can’t live up to those standards."
264,CHAIR YELLEN,"And those are our expectations, and we intend to hold banking organizations responsible for putting in place that kind of—that kind of risk-management and compliance environment."
266,CHAIR YELLEN,So I’m not—I’m not endorsing a general conclusion that banks are—banks of that size are too big to manage.
267,CHAIR YELLEN,"I believe they can be, but it may be challenging, and that’s what we expect."
276,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the projections—I agree, the projections for growth are slow."
277,CHAIR YELLEN,We have further written down our estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.
278,CHAIR YELLEN,"And what that reflects is an assessment that productivity growth is likely to remain low for an extended time, although it does embody an expectation that it will pick up from the miserable ½ percent pace per year that we have seen over the last five years."
279,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, why we would never—and slow growth is a factor."
280,CHAIR YELLEN,"Slow productivity growth is a factor that influences the longer-run normal level of interest rates, and writing down the likely pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate."
281,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s an important reason for revising down the neutral rate.
282,CHAIR YELLEN,"But now, let’s go to your—the part of your question about inflation."
283,CHAIR YELLEN,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month."
284,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that is a very solid pace of job growth and a pace that likely is not sustainable in the longer run, although we’ve been pleased to see people come back in the labor market."
285,CHAIR YELLEN,So it certainly is sustainable for some further amount of time.
286,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I think what ultimately drives inflation, both wage and price growth, is that tightness in the labor market and pressure on resource utilization."
287,CHAIR YELLEN,And the sad fact is that we are getting that healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output.
288,CHAIR YELLEN,So this is—I don’t think it bears on the inflation outlook.
289,CHAIR YELLEN,"It has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards."
290,CHAIR YELLEN,And that’s a big concern that policymakers should be focused on.
296,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, as I mentioned, we are going to be focusing on compliance risk management and board oversight not only at Wells, but also across bank holding companies."
297,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, consumer issues and issues that involve harm of consumers can become safety and soundness issues."
298,CHAIR YELLEN,"And if there was—at least one of the lessons from the financial crisis, I think, is that abuses of consumers of the sort that we see—saw in subprime lending ultimately did become—become safety and soundness issues."
299,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so, of course, we need to have that concern, and we’ll focus there."
300,CHAIR YELLEN,I think—I can’t really at this point give you specifics beyond that.
304,CHAIR YELLEN,So we have a system that Congress did set up in the Federal Reserve Act in which the governance of the Reserve Banks involves banks contributing capital and serving on the boards of directors.
305,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have long recognized inside the Federal Reserve that when we’re charged with supervision of banks, having bankers involved in that obviously presents conflict of interest."
306,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we have put in place very strong measures to ensure that those conflicts of interest are not allowed to play out in any—in any way, that bankers are not allowed to be involved in supervision."
307,CHAIR YELLEN,"Dodd-Frank changed the arrangement so that only the Class B and C, or nonbanking, directors can participate in the selection of the president as well."
308,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I think—I want to make sure the public has confidence that, in spite of the fact that we do have this banker involvement in our boards of directors, that it is not giving rise to any conflicts in our actual conduct of policy."
309,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, that setup—if that setup is changed, it raises which—it’s up to Congress to decide what to do here."
310,CHAIR YELLEN,"It raises complex issues about the governance—the whole governance arrangement in the Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve, and I would simply caution that if that is looked at, as Congress is entitled to do, that they think through carefully what the ramifications of making changes would be."
315,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags—that statement is due to Milton Friedman, and it is one of the essential things to understand about monetary policy, and it has not fundamentally changed at all."
316,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that is why I believe we have to be forward looking, and I’m not in favor of a “whites of their eyes” sort of approach."
317,CHAIR YELLEN,We need to operate based on forecasts.
318,CHAIR YELLEN,But the global economy and the U.S. economy have changed a lot.
319,CHAIR YELLEN,History doesn’t always exactly replay itself.
320,CHAIR YELLEN,"Many of the—those of us sitting around the table, we learned the lesson that if policy is not forward looking, that inflation can pick up to highly undesirable levels, that inflation expectations can be dislodged upward, and the consequence of that can be that, endemically, higher inflation takes place, which—it is very costly to reduce."
321,CHAIR YELLEN,And absolutely none of us want to relive an episode like that.
322,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so I believe, and my colleagues, that it is important to be forward looking."
323,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re not going to make that mistake again.
324,CHAIR YELLEN,"But the structure of the economy changes, things do change."
325,CHAIR YELLEN,"The nature of the inflation process has changed, I think, significantly since the bad days of the ’70s when the Fed had to face this chronic high-inflation problem."
326,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’ve seen inflation respond less to the economy, to movements in the unemployment rate—that’s sometimes said, “The Phillips curve has become flatter.” So we’ve seen less of a response."
327,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s something we need to factor into our decisionmaking.
328,CHAIR YELLEN,"Inflation expectations appear to be better anchored, and perhaps that’s been a result of a long period of low and stable inflation."
329,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s an asset.
330,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s something we didn’t have in the 1970s.
331,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, in addition, we have to be attentive to the fact there we’ve now had a long period in which inflation is actually undershooting our 2 percent objective."
332,CHAIR YELLEN,And we see some signs that I—we conclude inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored at 2 percent.
333,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we are seeing signs suggesting possible slippage there, and we’re a long way from being—facing the problems that Japan faces."
334,CHAIR YELLEN,"But there always a remi—should be a reminder to us that we also would not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low—running below our objective, inflation expectations are slipping."
335,CHAIR YELLEN,"And with a low neutral rate, that becomes more important."
336,CHAIR YELLEN,"So things are changed, but the principle of “forward looking” absolutely holds."
343,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I do think job training and job skills are important."
344,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we do work in community development, trying to—in the local communities where the Reserve Banks operate, to try to foster broader understanding of what kinds of programs work and how community organizations in state and local governments can put in place programs that will be helpful."
345,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ve recently visited a program that was very impressive in Philadelphia.
346,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ve visited some in Chicago and other places.
347,CHAIR YELLEN,So I do believe it’s possible to design programs that will help people overcome obstacles in getting jobs that are available.
348,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I definitely think that, you know, while we can play some role in facilitating understanding of what works and what doesn’t work that can be helpful, it’s certainly worthwhile for policymakers at the federal level, at state and local levels, to be focusing on this, because I think it is an area that would be helpful in making progress."
354,CHAIR YELLEN,So I think we have seen some modest pickup in wage growth.
355,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s running a little bit higher than it was over the last two years by a number of important measures.
356,CHAIR YELLEN,And we have seen income growth pick up recently.
357,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think the Census report was encouraging, showing that there are income gains, both because of more jobs and higher-paying jobs, and that that’s occurring throughout the income distribution."
358,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s helping many families.
359,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I do expect—we expect the unemployment rate to decline further, we expect labor market conditions to continue to improve."
360,CHAIR YELLEN,"And my hope and expectation is that we will see some further pickup in wage growth, and that it will be broadly beneficial to American households."
