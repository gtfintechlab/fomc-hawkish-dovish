0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
1,CHAIR POWELL,We decided today to lower the target for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2¼ percent.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"The outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, and this action is designed to support that outlook."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy, and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"All of these objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal: to sustain the expansion, with a strong job market and inflation close to our objective, for the benefit of the American people."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in September, as previously planned."
6,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.
7,CHAIR POWELL,"As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent objective for nine months."
9,CHAIR POWELL,Our interest rate target was at the low end of estimates of neutral.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed unemployment to near a half-century low."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
12,CHAIR POWELL,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.
13,CHAIR POWELL,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates."
15,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about any changes and then to today’s action.
16,CHAIR POWELL,"The median Committee participant’s assessments of the neutral rate of interest and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this year, reinforcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate."
17,CHAIR POWELL,These changes in the anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the economy.
18,CHAIR POWELL,"At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall direction of events."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"Job growth was strong in June and, looking through month-to-month fluctuations, the data point to continued strength."
21,CHAIR POWELL,We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe is required to hold the unemployment rate steady.
22,CHAIR POWELL,GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations.
23,CHAIR POWELL,Consumption—supported by rising incomes and high household confidence—is the main engine driving the economy forward.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and business fixed investment fell in the second quarter."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Foreign growth has disappointed, particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"In response to this weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or contemplating doing so."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking through this July 31, 2019 variability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL more cautious about their capital spending."
29,CHAIR POWELL,The domestic inflation shortfall has continued.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months."
31,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to expect that inflation will return over time to 2 percent.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures persist."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"We are mindful that inflation’s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult-to-reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy interest rate that would best support that outlook."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, we judge that those factors warrant the policy adjustment I described: “As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.” Thank you."
38,CHAIR POWELL,I am happy to take your questions.
44,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think you have to look at not just the 25 basis point cut, but look at the Committee’s actions over the course of the year."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases, we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we’ve moved here."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"I think what you’ve seen over the course of the year is, as we’ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support."
47,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think—I wouldn’t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned: to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we’re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy."
53,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you’re absolutely right."
54,CHAIR POWELL,The—the performance of the economy has been reasonably good.
55,CHAIR POWELL,"The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it’s been July 31, 2019 in a long time, and the outlook is also good."
56,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’ve been monitoring since the beginning of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the year is, effectively, downside risks to that outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere: weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China."
57,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so, and also inflation running below target."
58,CHAIR POWELL,"So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable."
59,CHAIR POWELL,"And, frankly, it is a continuation of what we’ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I—I really think it does, and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support—it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand."
63,CHAIR POWELL,So it will lower borrowing costs.
64,CHAIR POWELL,It will—and it will work.
65,CHAIR POWELL,And I think you see it.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"Since—you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw—I won’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"You see confidence, which had troughed in June—you saw it move back up."
68,CHAIR POWELL,You see economic activity on a healthy basis.
69,CHAIR POWELL,It just—it seems to work through confidence channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, yes."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think we—of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is, we do a deep dive into U.S. economic activity and global activity and, certainly, carefully went through U.S. economic activity, which there has been some positive and some negative, but, overall, the U.S. economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, the—the issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we’re trying to address those."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we’re going to be monitoring those same things."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S. economy."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we’ll be putting all of that together, and that’s how we’ll be thinking about policy going forward."
87,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"So that is—in a sense, that is a risk-management point, and that is a bit of insurance."
90,CHAIR POWELL,But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy.
91,CHAIR POWELL,"You see it July 31, 2019 now in the second quarter: You see weak investment, you see weak manufacturing—so support Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL demand there and also to support return of inflation to 2 percent."
92,CHAIR POWELL,But there’s definitely an insurance aspect of it.
93,CHAIR POWELL,Trade is unusual.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t—you know, the thing is, there isn’t a lot of experience in responding to global trade tensions."
95,CHAIR POWELL,So it is a—it’s something that we haven’t faced before and that we’re learning by doing.
96,CHAIR POWELL,"And it is not—it’s not exactly the same as watching global growth, where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle."
97,CHAIR POWELL,"With trade tensions—which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy—they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, I want to be clear here."
99,CHAIR POWELL,We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as—as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S. economy in the short and medium term.
100,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not in any way criticizing trade policy.
101,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really not our job.
107,CHAIR POWELL,So I actually think different people have different—different weightings has been my experience on those things.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown—and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which July 31, 2019 kind of point to more accommodation."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, I don’t think asking about a ¼ point is really Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the right question."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to, now, a rate cut."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’ve been providing—and that affects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy."
112,CHAIR POWELL,You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well.
113,CHAIR POWELL,Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of ’18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019—at the end of 2019.
114,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, in a way, that’s monetary policy working."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, I wouldn’t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question."
119,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
120,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, as we noted—we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we’re thinking about it."
121,CHAIR POWELL,"So it says, as we’re contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, we’ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information—and it talks about that language."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I can’t—all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth."
123,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be looking very carefully to see how that’s happening.
124,CHAIR POWELL,And I think you see—you learn—every cycle you learn about these things.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it’s bottoming out."
126,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll see that picture.
127,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll also see on trade.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re going to be seeing—I think we’ve learned a lot on trade in this July 31, 2019 cycle."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’ll continue to learn more, and on inflation we will."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in addition, the U.S."
131,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economy itself is—the performance of the U.S. economy will enter into that.
132,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would love to be more precise, but with trade, it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"Those are the things that we’ll be looking at, and—you know, in making our decisions going forward."
140,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
141,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t hear that from businesses.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"They don’t come in and say, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.” I haven’t heard that from a business."
143,CHAIR POWELL,What you hear is that demand is weak for their products.
144,CHAIR POWELL,You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.
145,CHAIR POWELL,Investment—business investment is weak.
146,CHAIR POWELL,And I wouldn’t lay all of that at the door of trade talks.
147,CHAIR POWELL,"I think there’s a—there’s a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that’s—that’s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than, certainly, we expected late last year."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"I think global—global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we anticipated."
150,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of, is this the—we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’s—we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned."
151,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ve already gone over how we’re thinking about going forward.
154,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, the sense of that is—I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’m contrasting it there with the beginning—for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle."
157,CHAIR POWELL,That is not—that’s not what we’re seeing now.
158,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not our perspective now or outlook.
162,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so our policy is—will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we’re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the outlook, as I mentioned."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"And, so I—that’s really where I would leave you with that."
171,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
172,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right."
173,CHAIR POWELL,I do agree with that.
174,CHAIR POWELL,The idea that you’re talking about is one that’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about.
175,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a—it’s one under consideration.
176,CHAIR POWELL,"The idea being, in a sense, we’ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, conceptually, you can think of—I’m not saying it’s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer."
179,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s—that’s really the point—is that we don’t rely—our system doesn’t rely on our ability—it doesn’t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool.
180,CHAIR POWELL,"We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements."
181,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that’s a good thing to do.
182,CHAIR POWELL,"The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that’s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it’s worth considering."
183,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the United Kingdom, in particular, has a countercyclical capital buffer that’s always on, but the one point of it is that you can cut when there’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room."
184,CHAIR POWELL,So this isn’t something we’ve decided to do.
185,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just under consideration.
186,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the real-time payment system, your second question, so this is something we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed, really, coming out of the Reserve System—the Reserve Banks and the Board together—convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about July 31, 2019 how we can move forward."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL companies—pretty much all of the groups who would be interested—and worked on a project for several years."
189,CHAIR POWELL,And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that problem.
190,CHAIR POWELL,"We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a lot of comments."
191,CHAIR POWELL,They were overwhelmingly favorable.
192,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators—for example, in wholesale payments, in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’t be unusual or out of keeping with—with how we’ve done things in the past."
193,CHAIR POWELL,"We have not made a decision on this, but it’s something we’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we’ll make a decision on soon."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"So it is—as I mentioned, it’s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it’s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative July 31, 2019 stance."
204,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we’re seeing.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s what we’re going to be looking—you know, we’ll Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL be looking at incoming data, at all of the—at the risks that I mentioned, and the performance of the U.S. economy, and at low inflation."
206,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be looking at that to make our decisions going forward.
211,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think the best thing for people who are—who are feeling that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate-income communities to the effect that they’re now feeling the recovery, and, in fact, they haven’t felt a better labor market in anybody’s memory, so this is great to hear."
212,CHAIR POWELL,"And I guess my view is, the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that’s one of the overarching goals of—of this move and all of our policy moves."
213,CHAIR POWELL,There really is no reason why the expansion can’t keep going.
214,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation is not troublingly high.
215,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the—at the U.S. economy right now, there’s no sector that’s booming and therefore might bust."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"You have a fairly well-balanced, in a sense, economy."
217,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the engine, though, is really a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy."
218,CHAIR POWELL,The manufacturing economy—the investment and manufacturing part of the economy—is more or less not—not growing much.
219,CHAIR POWELL,It’s at a healthy level but not growing much.
220,CHAIR POWELL,So—and we hope to help that with this rate cut.
221,CHAIR POWELL,"But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"So I gave my—my reasons for—our reasons, really—for doing this."
227,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s what we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation."
229,CHAIR POWELL,I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it."
231,CHAIR POWELL,We never take into account political considerations.
232,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no place in our discussions for that.
233,CHAIR POWELL,We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.
234,CHAIR POWELL,"We conduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that’s what we’re always going to do."
235,CHAIR POWELL,We’re always going to use our tools that way.
236,CHAIR POWELL,"And then, at the end, we’ll—you know, we’ll live with the results."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency."
238,CHAIR POWELL,Really nothing more to it than that.
246,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
247,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first, let me say—I’ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well."
248,CHAIR POWELL,I do.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve—you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as a reason not to take this action today."
251,CHAIR POWELL,I just don’t think—that would be my point.
252,CHAIR POWELL,"And one of the reasons why I think that is, if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"And we look at, really, four big things so that we know we can—you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting, and—you know, and see whether we got this right, because it’s transparent now."
255,CHAIR POWELL,But the four things we look at are valuation pressures.
256,CHAIR POWELL,"And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but, you know, honestly, not at a highly troubling level."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing."
258,CHAIR POWELL,Households are in a very good shape overall.
259,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll come back to business borrowing.
260,CHAIR POWELL,"Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"So, overall, staff’s view has been—and my view has been—that if you look overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"The place that gets all the attention right now—a lot of attention—is business borrowing, and we look very carefully at that."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"What’s happening with business borrowing is, the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn."
265,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re watching that very carefully.
266,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, I think if you July 31, 2019 look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience—much higher Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL than it was before the crisis—and that’s something to take comfort from."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to—you know, to keep the financial system resilient."
270,CHAIR POWELL,There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all.
271,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, of course, we monitor."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"We have—every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday."
273,CHAIR POWELL,So we look at this on an ongoing basis.
274,CHAIR POWELL,We have a great team.
275,CHAIR POWELL,We liaise with central banks around the world.
276,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these things all the time."
277,CHAIR POWELL,And we worry about them all the time.
278,CHAIR POWELL,We’re always looking at the—we’re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.
279,CHAIR POWELL,"But the things we haven’t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy."
284,CHAIR POWELL,No.
285,CHAIR POWELL,Let me be clear.
286,CHAIR POWELL,"What I said was, it’s not—it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts."
287,CHAIR POWELL,I didn’t—I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that.
288,CHAIR POWELL,"What I said is, when you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the July 31, 2019 Committee is not seeing that—not seeing us in that place."
289,CHAIR POWELL,You would do that if you saw real Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.
290,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not what we’re seeing.
291,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not what we’re seeing.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to—to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking at it."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"What I said was, it’s not a long cutting cycle—in other words, referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very severe downturn."
294,CHAIR POWELL,That’s—that’s really what I was ruling out.
295,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments, you’ll see—you know, I don’t know that they’ll be, in the end, comparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor."
301,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we look at a broad range of factors, and trade uncertainty—trade policy uncertainty is one of them."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"And without knowing—you know, I think we—with trade, we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be, and so it’s hard to exactly say."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"Certainly, we’ve seen, though, that when there’s a sharp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly."
305,CHAIR POWELL,We saw that in June.
306,CHAIR POWELL,"But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ve seen it returning to—to a much lower temperature, I July 31, 2019 think."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, with—with trade policy, we’re just going to be watching and trying to assess the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL implications for the—for the U.S. outlook."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small."
311,CHAIR POWELL,They’re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.
313,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, very, very hard to tease that out."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve seen some research, which—you know, which says that they are meaningful—meaningful effects on—on output."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s to say, not trivial."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that that sounds right, but it’s quite hard to get—there is no way to get an accurate measure."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it’s a factor, particularly businesses that have—manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you that it’s been a challenge."
318,CHAIR POWELL,"Many of them have made adjustments, and they’ve gotten to a place where it’s okay, but it’s—it’s been a challenge."
326,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, you’re right."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a range of views on the Committee, and—but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make."
328,CHAIR POWELL,"And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the way forward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the—you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that’s the roadmap we’re going to be following going forward."
330,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to be data dependent.
331,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"So the problems at Wells Fargo—that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer—the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that."
337,CHAIR POWELL,"And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t been fixed quickly, and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"So they’re—you know, they—they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"And the Committee—I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but, as I said, they’re deep-seated issues, and it just takes time to address them."
340,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question.
341,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t really have anything for you on that.
344,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not going to characterize it.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"You know—I mean, I have characterized it."
346,CHAIR POWELL,We have—we have an enforcement action in place.
347,CHAIR POWELL,The company is working away at addressing it.
348,CHAIR POWELL,They take it seriously.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"I think they do see it as we do, as something that has to go deep."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ll lift the growth cap when we’re satisfied."
354,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the premise is not—I will question your premise for a second."
355,CHAIR POWELL,"If you remember whether—again, one of the purposes of our—of our cut today is to support the expansion."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t know when—and if it really works—if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the—where the funds, in other cycles—and I don’t know whether this will happen or not, but in other cycles, the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I’m not predicting that, but I don’t think that we know that we won’t have—that we’ll have less ammo because of these things."
358,CHAIR POWELL,That’s one thing.
359,CHAIR POWELL,So— NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
360,CHAIR POWELL,But you won’t be able to cut as much if—if rates are low.
361,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, you will have—have less ammo, in that sense."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"Just as a matter of principle, I don’t think that’s right."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"In other—in other long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking—in fact, will cut—and then will go back to hiking."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I don’t know whether that’ll happen right here."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"It doesn’t July 31, 2019 seem—it doesn’t seem like something that’s in—you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL don’t know that."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle, you—you do have a lot of benefits from that."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have."
369,CHAIR POWELL,A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn’t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.
370,CHAIR POWELL,"And you’re right, there will eventually be one."
371,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time comes."
375,CHAIR POWELL,So the monetary policy review is really for—it’s really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run.
376,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not something that enters directly into our discussions today.
377,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings, called Fed Listens, at almost all the Reserve Banks."
378,CHAIR POWELL,Soon it will be all the Reserve Banks.
379,CHAIR POWELL,"And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people—not just—not just economists, but people who are not economists, how—how their lives interact with the Fed’s work."
380,CHAIR POWELL,It’s been—it’s been great.
381,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I hoped it would be."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we’re asking about our framework."
383,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s very early to say where that’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is July 31, 2019 and looking at how it’s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL during the Global Financial Crisis."
384,CHAIR POWELL,I expect we’ll be at this a while.
385,CHAIR POWELL,I’m very excited about it.
386,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s been a good exercise.
387,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.
388,CHAIR POWELL,And I think it’s a good time.
389,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, you have—10 years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework."
393,CHAIR POWELL,So I think this was—this was well telegraphed.
394,CHAIR POWELL,What we did today was—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.
395,CHAIR POWELL,I had mentioned the reasons for it.
396,CHAIR POWELL,"They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think—you know, I think they will—they will achieve their goals."
397,CHAIR POWELL,"We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this year have really worked."
398,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to—in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture, but—I’ll leave it there."
404,CHAIR POWELL,"Yeah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"And we do—we have had these global, really, risks to the outlook."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"There really—there really is nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a—you know, a prominent near-term threat to the U.S. economy."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, there’s no—there’s no segment that’s really—or sector that’s really boiling over and overheating."
408,CHAIR POWELL,Nothing like that.
409,CHAIR POWELL,It’s—it’s within—within the economy.
410,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—it’s healthy, so I would say that."
411,CHAIR POWELL,Downside risks are really coming from abroad.
412,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we are concerned about—about low inflation."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"But—and, by the way, those risks from abroad are affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment—fixed investment."
414,CHAIR POWELL,So—thank you.
