0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the Committee’s decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment about the appropriate path of monetary policy."
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the Committee is maintaining a highly accommodative policy."
3,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and we continue to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
4,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In addition, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year our program of lengthening the maturity of our securities holdings rather than completing the program this month as previously scheduled."
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less."
6,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The details of our plans for our securities purchases and sales were described in an accompanying statement released today and can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.
7,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative than they would otherwise be, thereby supporting economic recovery."
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the longer run."
9,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,These projections are important inputs to the Committee’s deliberations.
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Incoming information suggests that the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace in the face of headwinds generated by the situation in Europe, a still-depressed housing market, tight credit for some borrowers, and fiscal restraint at the federal, state, and local levels."
11,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Business and household spending are increasing at rates consistent with moderate economic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier this year."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Employment gains have been smaller in recent months, and the unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, remains elevated."
13,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In light of these developments, Committee participants have generally marked down their projections for economic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then picking up gradually."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Based on their projections for economic growth, FOMC participants foresee slower progress in reducing unemployment than they did in April."
15,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 percent to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, levels that would remain above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rates of unemployment."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In addition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment."
17,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, participants noted that strains in global financial markets, associated principally with the situation in Europe, continue to pose significant risks to the recovery and to further improvement in labor market conditions."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Meanwhile, inflation has declined recently, primarily reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline."
19,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium run will run at or below the most consistent with its statutory mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"More specifically, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.2 to 1.7 percent for 2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014."
21,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you can see from the chart, Committee participants have a range of views about when the initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be warranted."
23,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"After a thorough discussion of those views, and of the ongoing uncertainty and risks surrounding the outlook, the FOMC—as I mentioned—maintained its collective judgment that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, and it agreed to provide further support to the economy by continuing the maturity extension program."
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.
25,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’d be glad to take your questions.
32,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in a continuous fashion until December of 2008."
33,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And since then, we’ve been operating with nonstandard monetary tools, including asset purchases and extension of maturities."
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"By their nature, these tend to be lumpy."
35,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We haven’t done them in a continuous way.
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But our view of the effects of these programs on the economy is that the total stock of outstanding securities in our portfolio is what determines the level of accommodation that the economy is receiving.
37,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So in that respect, it wouldn’t be really a start and stop; rather, whenever we have stopped purchasing, the level of accommodation that was already in the system remains there until conditions warrant further action."
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, underlying all this, of course, is the fact that the outlook has changed."
39,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Like many other forecasters, the Federal Reserve was too optimistic early in the recovery about the pace of recovery."
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And we’ve had to add additional accommodation going forward, as we have seen, in fact, that the headwinds have kept the recovery from being as strong as we would like."
41,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, by the nature of these unconventional tools, they are—tend to be more discreet in their size, but they continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases has ended."
43,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we’ve taken a step today, which is a substantive step, which will provide additional accommodation for the economy."
44,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, moreover, we have stated that we’re prepared to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery in the labor market."
45,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we are prepared to do what’s necessary."
46,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We are prepared to provide support for the economy.
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, there’s been a great deal of economic news since our last meeting."
55,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The incoming data were somewhat disappointing—but not entirely clear how to read them.
56,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We had issues with weather and seasonal adjustment and other factors.
57,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Meanwhile, Europe has had additional problems."
58,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ve seen some of those effects in financial markets.
59,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I think, there is some case to be made for making some additional judgments about where the economy is going."
60,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, the step we took, the extension of the maturity extension program, I think, is a substantive step, and it will provide some additional support."
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And yes, additional asset purchases would be among the things that we would certainly consider if we need to take additional measures to strengthen the economy."
67,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea."
68,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems.
69,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We welcome help and support from any other part of the government, from other economic policymakers."
70,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, collaboration is—would be great."
71,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I wouldn’t accept the proposition, though, that the Fed has no more ammunition."
72,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I do think that our tools, while they are nonstandard, still can create more-accommodative financial conditions, can still provide support for the economy, can still help us return to a more normal economic situation."
73,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, again, any other support that is forthcoming, any other economic policies that are undertaken that are helpful in terms of making our economy stronger are welcome."
74,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I do think that monetary policy still does have some capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial conditions.
81,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset purchase programs, so-called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions."
82,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And although there were certain problems in transmission—for example, the housing market has not been as responsive as it’s been in some times in the past—we do think that they were both effective in providing support for the economy, and in particular, so-called QE2 ended what looked to be an incipient deflation problem when we first introduced it."
83,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I do think those have been effective, and as I said to Mr. Hilsenrath, we think that these kinds of programs can still provide additional support."
84,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"With respect to the rest of your questions, I just want to reiterate that the Federal Reserve is nonpartisan, we are very serious about taking our decisions based on purely economic grounds without political considerations, and we’ll continue to do that."
89,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the interest rates are quite low, and they’re being pushed down more by safe-haven flows and other factors."
90,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, I think we can lower interest rates more."
91,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But beyond that, Operation Twist and asset purchases work also through other channels."
92,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, by acquiring securities in the market and bringing them onto the Fed’s balance sheet, we essentially induce investors to move into substitute securities."
93,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, for example, an investor who sells a Treasury security to the Fed may end up buying a corporate bond instead, and so the effect will be to lower corporate bond rates and corporate spreads."
94,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Or a bank may, having sold its Treasury securities, may decide to make a loan instead."
95,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it’s not just the effect on the long-term interest rate, but there’s a broader set of effects that feed through other asset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial conditions which is supportive to the economy."
101,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, it’s our intention to do all we can to make sure that it doesn’t go on indefinitely."
102,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Unemployment is still too high, but it has come down."
103,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It was about 10 percent at the peak, and now it’s closer to 8 percent."
104,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It’s going down too slowly, but it is going down."
105,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Our sense is that people are finding jobs, but just not at the rate that we would like to see."
106,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, you know, as I said, and as the statement says, if we don’t see continued improvement in the labor market, we’ll be prepared to take additional steps if appropriate."
112,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first of all, again, we are—we did take a substantive step today by extending the maturity extension program to the end of the year."
113,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, I think that’s a meaningful additional step."
115,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It depends on—each individual has their own path of optimal policy, so we’ll provide more information about that in the minutes."
116,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But—and again, we’re prepared to do more."
117,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have to get, I think, further information about the state of the economy, about where things are going, about what’s happening in Europe."
118,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I guess I would add to that, though, that, you know, each of these nonstandard programs does have various costs and risks associated with it with respect to market functioning, with respect to financial stability, with respect to the exit process, and so I don’t think they should be launched lightly."
119,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think there should be some conviction that they’re needed, but if we do come to that conviction, then we’ll take those additional steps."
122,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line."
123,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Europe is a wealthy area.
124,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,They have adequate resources to address these problems.
125,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"They are very committed to addressing these problems because keeping the euro zone together, keeping the euro-zone trading bloc together is very important to the economies of those countries, so we leave to them the leadership."
126,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Federal Reserve is very much involved in talking with and consulting with European leaders.
127,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I talk frequently to central bankers in Europe, including Mario Draghi and others."
128,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We try to provide whatever help and support we can.
129,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We did, of course, coordinate earlier in the provision of the dollar swaps to other central banks, which have been useful in reducing pressures in dollar funding markets and allowing European banks to continue lending in dollars, including to U.S. borrowers."
130,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, at this point, we are consulting frequently."
131,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We are prepared to work together if that can be done constructively.
132,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But at this point, you know, we are mostly just in consultation mode."
137,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think it’s still a bit early, but as we move forward in the year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so-called fiscal cliff will have some economic effects."
138,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that."
139,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"More generally, financial markets don’t like uncertainty and, particularly, uncertainty of this magnitude, and that, I think, will be a negative."
140,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So that uncertainty is there, that’s going to be an issue."
141,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think most importantly, though, is that Congress get the policy right."
142,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’ve talked about three elements for fiscal policy.
143,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The first is to do no harm as far as the recovery is concerned, to try to avoid a fiscal cliff that would significantly damage the recovery."
144,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But second, to maintain the effort to achieve a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term."
145,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And third, to use fiscal policy effectively—to have a better tax code, to make good use of government spending programs and make them efficient and effective, and so on."
146,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think if Congress does all those things, the ultimate benefits would be substantial."
151,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, that’s a difficult problem."
152,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’m not entirely sure.
153,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because people are uncertain about what’s going to happen."
154,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the other hand, investors I know would like to see Congress take actions that put us on a long-term, sustainable fiscal path, and simply kicking the can down the road without any other indication of what might be done, what kinds of policies might be enacted, could be a negative for sentiment because it might induce people to worry more about the seriousness of Congress in addressing our fiscal issues."
158,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Sure.
159,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, access to credit is a major issue, there’s no question about it."
160,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Mortgage access is much tighter than it’s been for a long time.
161,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Even credit card access is more restricted than it has been in the past.
162,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And that—what that does is, to some extent, it mutes the impact of the Fed’s actions."
163,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, I don’t think it’s at all accurate to say that Federal Reserve policy is not helping the broad public."
164,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First of all, many Americans are able to take advantage of lower interest rates."
165,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Many people have refinanced or bought homes.
166,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Others have taken out loans to buy cars.
167,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Auto loans are cheap and broadly available.
168,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect effects."
169,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If a firm has a low cost of capital, and we’ve seen a lot of corporate borrowing in the last couple of years, then they’re more likely to expand, to add capital, to add products, and, consequently, they are more likely to hire."
170,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls have increased in the last few years has been disappointing, there have been significant increases, and the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points."
171,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Some of that comes from the broad impact of Fed policy on spending, on investment, and those effects affect the broad public indirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing."
181,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Sure.
182,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I gave a list of some of the headwinds in my opening remarks.
183,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I do think that the European situation is slowing U.S. economic growth.
184,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First of all, Europe is, if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products."
185,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"More broadly, the effects of European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth."
186,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that has been an issue.
187,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And more broadly, we’ve seen some slowing in global economic growth more generally, including in Asia, which also has reduced somewhat our ability to export."
188,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s one set of concerns that’s been important.
189,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’d mentioned two others, I think, as being primarily important."
190,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,One is housing.
191,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Housing usually plays a very important role in economic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because higher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending."
192,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Housing does seem to be doing somewhat better.
193,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There are some good signs in housing, but nevertheless, we are not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the recovery that we would normally get from a housing recovery."
194,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The other area is, as you indicated, is fiscal."
195,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And that happens at all different levels: federal, state, and local."
196,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Notwithstanding programs earlier on, in the last year or two and going forward we have been seeing fiscal consolidation."
197,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Particularly at the state and local level, of course, tight budgets have led to a lot of layoffs and cancellation of projects and so on."
198,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I understand that these are necessary steps from the perspective of individual states and localities.
199,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’m not criticizing that; it’s just a fact, though, that these contractions are affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy."
200,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think those would be the main things I would point to, and put them all together, and you have an economy which is growing less quickly than it normally would following a recession of the magnitude that we saw."
204,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the government is very gradually increasing the duration of its debt—the Treasury, I mean—and it’s been doing that for some period of time."
205,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s a bit of an issue here, which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program we announced today, the maturity extension program, is we’re taking longer-term debt off the market in order to induce investors to move into other assets and to lower longer-term interest rates."
206,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"To the extent that the Treasury actively sought to lengthen duration of its borrowing, it would, to some extent, offset the benefits of that—of those policies."
207,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So my understanding of what the Treasury is doing is that they have a plan, they’re sticking to that plan, and therefore, on the margin, the effects of the Fed’s actions can be felt."
215,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I can’t give you any specific numbers because this is ultimately a Committee decision, but what the Committee is going to do is review all the labor market indicators, including unemployment, including participation, and other measures of labor market activity, and try to make a sense—try to get a sense of whether or not the labor market is improving in a sustainable way."
216,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s not a month-to-month proposition.
217,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You know, this year already, we’ve seen a few months of very strong job gains, and we saw two months of weaker gains."
218,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Obviously, month to month, there is going to be statistical noise—there is going to be weather, there’s going to be a lot of factors that can cause job gains to vary."
221,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That’s the kind of thing that we’ll be looking at, but I really can’t be too much more specific than that."
227,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, on the fiscal cliff, I mean, just the way that the programs are set up, the dollar amount associated with the tax expirations—tax-cut expirations, including the payroll tax cut and so on, is larger than the spending cuts, as I understand it."
228,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I’m not making any judgment about individual programs.
229,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The point here is that putting all these things together, you have a very substantial withdrawal of income from the economy that will affect spending and will affect the ability of the economy to recover in the short run."
231,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Those are tough decisions that Congress has to make, but in terms of the fiscal cliff, in terms of what’s going to happen in January, the—it’s really the total of both spending cuts and tax increases which has the impact, which not only we, but others like the Congressional Budget Office, have identified as being a concern."
232,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ll still be able to do open market operations with our securities, even if the amount of short-term debt is very low."
233,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And indeed, of course, over time, the—as securities come close to maturation, we will have other securities that are of short duration."
239,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, on the second question, it’s a five-agency rule, I believe, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like 18,000 comment letters, so it’s been a very difficult process in terms of the amount of work that has to be done, amount of coordination that has to be done, so I don’t have a date for you."
240,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think if there’s a silver lining to the events you referred to, it may be that there’s some things we can learn in terms of writing the rule and thinking about how it would work."
241,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One aspect of our rule that I think would have been important in the context of the loss is that, in the rule, a bank would be required to provide a plan in advance explaining how the hedge was going to be done, how it was going to work."
242,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It would be necessary to have an auditing process to make sure that, in fact, that was being followed, that there were adequate risk management and governance rules to oversee the process, and it would be necessary that compensation for the executives involved in the management of the position would not be such that it would incentivize them to take proprietary positions."
243,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, one aspect of the rule that might have been relevant—and again, we are still looking at that situation, as are the OCC and others—would have been the control, the governance aspects of it, and that might have potentially changed the outcome."
246,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we hope it doesn’t get worse."
247,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think it’s already one of the factors that has been a drag on U.S. recovery—not the only factor by any means, there are a number of others that I mentioned, but it has been having an effect, and it’s been having an effect on the economies of other countries as well, countries that export to Europe."
248,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it is a significant issue.
249,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer."
250,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there’s a lot of work to be done.
251,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, we think that the policymakers in Europe have very strong incentives to get this right, and we’re very hopeful that they will get it right, and we are in close contact with them as they work on these issues."
252,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, it is also important for us to be prepared for any further problems that might emerge from Europe, and we have been doing that."
253,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, you know, we recently did our stress tests of the large bank holding companies to make sure they had enough capital even in the face of a severe financial crisis or a European crisis."
254,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have been monitoring the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to Europe and, of course, monitoring the situation there very closely."
255,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we are hoping for the best, we are hoping that European policymakers will take the additional steps they need to take to stabilize the situation."
256,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But we are prepared, in case things get worse, to protect the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial system."
263,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we’re very interested in it, and we’re certainly going to follow it."
264,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The details are not yet available.
265,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think it should be noted that it’s not just a Bank of England program, but it’s joint with the British Treasury."
268,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But we are looking for—as you know, throughout the crisis, we’ve looked for new programs, new ways to help the economy."
269,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And this will be a type of thing that will be on the list of programs that we look at.
277,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the—in terms of the inflation forecasts, again, I think it should be said, as a preliminary point, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty about them."
278,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We talk about that uncertainty in the survey of economic projections.
279,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we shouldn’t take a false sense of precision from those numbers.
280,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, there is an issue about whether or not there’s sufficient stimulus in the economy."
281,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the types of unconventional programs that are available are—we know less about them, they have various costs and risks, and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial accommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short-term interest rates can be varied freely."
282,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I think that’s really a critical issue.
283,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, in terms of the costs, I would list, briefly, large asset purchases increase the size of our balance sheet and therefore ultimately will make exit a more extended process."
284,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Large asset purchases—which means that the Fed owns a larger share of a particular type of asset—may have implications for market functioning, which in turn might affect the ability of the Fed to have stimulative effects on the economy."
285,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There are some financial stability issues that we are monitoring and that have to be taken into account.
286,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So any kind of assessment of appropriate policy must look both at the outlook for the economy and for—and at the costs and risks associated with new measures, new steps that might be taken."
287,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, again, I think at this point, we still do have considerable scope to do more, and we are prepared to do more."
288,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ll continue to monitor the economy and see how things evolve.
289,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And if—again, we’re looking primarily at the labor market in this respect—if we’re not seeing a sustained improvement in the labor market, that would require additional action."
290,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of balance sheet actions, we are unlikely to do more maturity extension for a while because we have taken that about as far as we can."
291,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we would have to take other types of steps in order to add to the amount of stimulus in the economy.
298,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the U.S. economy is in a situation where short-term interest rates are close to zero."
299,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach."
300,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It’s been one of the themes of my own work for a long time, including some of the work I did on the Bank of Japan, that central banks are not out of tools once the short-term interest rate hits zero."
301,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There are additional steps that can be taken.
302,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And we have demonstrated through both communications techniques—guidance about future policy, which is something the Japanese have done as well, by the way—and through asset purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done, that central banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery even when short-term interest rates are close to zero."
303,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, as I mentioned to Mr. Ip, these nonstandard policies are less well understood, and they do have some costs and risks."
304,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I do think that, at the same time, that they can be effective in helping the economy."
309,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"No, I don’t think so."
310,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If—take, for example, I’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to lend."
311,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t think that’s quite right.
312,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"What we’re lowering is the safe interest rate, the Treasury rate."
313,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That should make it even more attractive for banks, rather than to hold securities, to look for borrowers and to earn the spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending to households and businesses."
314,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, in fact, support lending."
315,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, the question arises in some contexts whether there are other barriers to lending as exist, for example, in some parts of the mortgage market."
316,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But lower interest rates on securities and other types of assets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for higher-yielding returns, higher-yielding assets in the form of loans to household and businesses."
320,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Federal Reserve isn’t going to be buying European sovereign debt, except we have a very limited amount of European sovereign debt as part of our foreign exchange reserves, and it comes primarily from a small number of countries."
321,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s not something that we would be engaged in.
325,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, they are two terrific people with great experience."
326,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’ve known Jeremy for a long time.
327,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,He’s an outstanding academic and knows a lot about finance.
328,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Jay has both market experience and a lot of experience in government.
329,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,They both bring a lot to the table.
330,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"This was their first meeting, so I think, to some extent, they were in listening mode."
331,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But they do have an awful lot to offer, and I really do look forward to working with them because I think that they are exceptional people."
332,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I’m glad, for the first time—I believe it’s the case that this is the first time that we had seven Governors at an FOMC meeting since 2005."
333,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So it’s great to have a full complement of people, and it will help us do our other work as well as our monetary policy work more effectively."
335,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
