0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged."
2,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
3,CHAIR POWELL,Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall, the economy continues on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains rebounded in March after a weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year."
10,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
11,CHAIR POWELL,"For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall inflation May 1, 2019 fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moves mostly due to changes in energy prices."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system."
16,CHAIR POWELL,Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months."
18,CHAIR POWELL,We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work.
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff, starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely May 1, 2019 in September."
29,CHAIR POWELL,These plans support our longer-run dual-mandate objectives and also provide Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL clarity about the path of our asset holdings.
30,CHAIR POWELL,Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the federal government."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term."
35,CHAIR POWELL,This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Today’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate."
40,CHAIR POWELL,The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.
41,CHAIR POWELL,We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range.
42,CHAIR POWELL,"As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate."
43,CHAIR POWELL,Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.
44,CHAIR POWELL,These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"And today we made one more such May 1, 2019 change."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and it remains unchanged."
47,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
48,CHAIR POWELL,I will be glad to take your questions.
56,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis."
57,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction."
58,CHAIR POWELL,I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.
59,CHAIR POWELL,"As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core."
60,CHAIR POWELL,So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.
61,CHAIR POWELL,"So “persistent” carries the sense of something that’s not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much."
65,CHAIR POWELL,"Indeed, the Dallas trimmed mean Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL is at 2 percent."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now."
76,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So— we do, of course, though—as a routine matter, as you well know—we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be."
78,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s all we do.
79,CHAIR POWELL,And I would just say that we’re comfortable—the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance.
85,CHAIR POWELL,"So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests."
86,CHAIR POWELL,But we do think it’s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.
87,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So we think it’s important, and we have the tools to do that, so we’ve used them again today."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, this is just a technical fix."
90,CHAIR POWELL,It really has no implications for policy.
93,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, I mean—so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate."
94,CHAIR POWELL,And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate."
96,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don’t see us not controlling it."
97,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’ll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions."
103,CHAIR POWELL,We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of fact—and had that discussion as well."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it."
106,CHAIR POWELL,"First, we’ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public."
107,CHAIR POWELL,And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so."
112,CHAIR POWELL,Leverage in the financial sector—I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.
113,CHAIR POWELL,Default rates are low.
114,CHAIR POWELL,Borrowing is relatively low.
115,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we’ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that—not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"And then the last two—the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate."
119,CHAIR POWELL,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.
120,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better—capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that."
121,CHAIR POWELL,Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.
126,CHAIR POWELL,"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there."
127,CHAIR POWELL,And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.
128,CHAIR POWELL,The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.
129,CHAIR POWELL,And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.
130,CHAIR POWELL,"The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"It appears to be more—we May 1, 2019 don’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight, but some of it Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic."
133,CHAIR POWELL,Sorry.
136,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, I mean—so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of, constitutional document."
137,CHAIR POWELL,"If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy."
138,CHAIR POWELL,I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.
139,CHAIR POWELL,"Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times."
144,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going to move around."
145,CHAIR POWELL,There will always be factors hitting it.
146,CHAIR POWELL,"So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation May 1, 2019 expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL not been pushed by those other factors."
147,CHAIR POWELL,So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.
148,CHAIR POWELL,It’s actually still a measurable role.
149,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role."
150,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the slack part."
151,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up."
152,CHAIR POWELL,"And if it isn’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that’s something we’d take into account in setting policy."
156,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think, generally, I’d have to see the data on that."
157,CHAIR POWELL,It sounds like you picked a particular time frame.
158,CHAIR POWELL,"Over time, I really wonder whether that’s the case."
159,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large."
160,CHAIR POWELL,So— DONNA BORAK.
161,CHAIR POWELL,Just to push a little bit on this.
163,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the Fed, so I’m really not going to go there."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"I haven’t seen this research either, so I don’t really—really know."
166,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
170,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
171,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s right.
172,CHAIR POWELL,"I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2."
173,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we learn from these instances."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re fairly rare, but we learn from them, and in this case it was internal, and it’s been corrected."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate."
182,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their expansion."
183,CHAIR POWELL,So things are possible.
184,CHAIR POWELL,All I can see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.
185,CHAIR POWELL,Growth is at a healthy level.
186,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market is strong.
187,CHAIR POWELL,We see job creation.
188,CHAIR POWELL,We see wages moving up.
189,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent."
190,CHAIR POWELL,So I see us on a good path for this year.
193,CHAIR POWELL,Similarities in the length.
194,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, the situations were quite different then."
195,CHAIR POWELL,"This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history."
196,CHAIR POWELL,I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.
197,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what’s relevant for us now."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent."
204,CHAIR POWELL,"So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in context—so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations: catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff."
205,CHAIR POWELL,"As you also are I’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of May 1, 2019 businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL just to get a better sense of the economy."
206,CHAIR POWELL,"We put all that together, and we come together for two days."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"That takes up most of the first day, and we talk about this in great detail."
209,CHAIR POWELL,"We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy."
210,CHAIR POWELL,"And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments."
212,CHAIR POWELL,"And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook."
213,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction.
214,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ll not hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction."
215,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s our process.
216,CHAIR POWELL,That’s how we think about things.
217,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think about other factors.
218,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t let them into our decisionmaking.
219,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t discuss them.
225,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
226,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below."
227,CHAIR POWELL,"And that includes us, although we’ve actually done— May 1, 2019 we’ve come closer, I think, than most others."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges."
229,CHAIR POWELL,"One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower—will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates."
230,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is another challenge."
232,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing."
239,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth."
240,CHAIR POWELL,Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.
241,CHAIR POWELL,Services have been growing faster.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say that the basis for that, really, is consumer spending and business investment."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March."
252,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up."
253,CHAIR POWELL,All those things are going to support consumer spending.
254,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a significant part of the outlook this year.
255,CHAIR POWELL,And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction.
256,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"If you import metals or whatever for your product or export your product, then it’s been a challenge for you."
259,CHAIR POWELL,So that would be a positive.
260,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t think—it wouldn’t be the kind of thing where you’d immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a May 1, 2019 longer period."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"So that, I think—that would be my expectation."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know, though."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"I haven’t Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL seen—none of us, at least I haven’t seen, the details of what’s been negotiated."
267,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
268,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I would just mention a couple."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low."
273,CHAIR POWELL,There was a change in the methodology.
274,CHAIR POWELL,And another one is airfares.
275,CHAIR POWELL,There are many little things.
276,CHAIR POWELL,"So we don’t know until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s at 2 percent—or it’s at, I don’t know whether it went down or was above that, but it’s at 2 percent now."
280,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s reason to think that these will be transient.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case."
282,CHAIR POWELL,I would point to the case of cell phone services.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019 very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, we’ll have to see here."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that’s part of our mandate."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"So we would be concerned, and we’d take it into account."
296,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t really be any more specific than what I’ve said.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"If we need to, and as needed, we will use our tools to keep the federal funds rate somewhere in the target range."
302,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll do that.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"Don’t expect to need to do it again, but we don’t know."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned."
305,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.
306,CHAIR POWELL,And so I—there is no template for this.
307,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no roadmap.
308,CHAIR POWELL,"We just have to do it, and that’s why we’re moving so very gradually."
309,CHAIR POWELL,It’s why we tapered the roll-off to only $15 billion in Treasuries per month.
310,CHAIR POWELL,"Effective, I guess, today, we’re cutting the roll-off rate for Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here."
311,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s that.
312,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of other tools, we’re actually—I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be looking at the idea of a repo facility."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t have any presupposition that it’s something we would do, but we’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I wouldn’t say—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then go away and think about it for a little while."
315,CHAIR POWELL,And then probably come back and make a decision.
316,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s something we’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we got a lot of comments, and we’re reviewing them carefully."
321,CHAIR POWELL,I really don’t have a lot for you.
322,CHAIR POWELL,I know they’re making good progress.
323,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t really have a date though.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"And in terms of what all it’s going to be, it’s not something I can say with any certainty yet."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year."
331,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, no signs of overheating."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing."
333,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all."
334,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity.
335,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now—wages and benefits are now between 3 and 3½ percent."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing."
340,CHAIR POWELL,You mentioned productivity.
341,CHAIR POWELL,So productivity is really very difficult to predict.
342,CHAIR POWELL,"No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won’t really try."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will say this: Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know if that level can be sustained, but we really—it’s driven, to some extent, by technological developments and, really, the diffusion of technology through the economy, and it’s very hard to predict."
346,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it’s positive.
347,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, I’ll mention, if we’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation."
348,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity."
349,CHAIR POWELL,And that does suggest more room to grow.
350,CHAIR POWELL,"It suggests that a less tight economy, a less, you know—may be part of the explanation for lower inflation."
351,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks very much.
