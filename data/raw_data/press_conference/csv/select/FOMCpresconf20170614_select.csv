0,CHAIR YELLEN,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR YELLEN,"Before I get started, I just want to say that our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning."
2,CHAIR YELLEN,"Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1 to 1¼ percent."
3,CHAIR YELLEN,"Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the progress the economy has made, and is expected to make, toward maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law."
4,CHAIR YELLEN,"We also released today, as an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, additional information on the process that we will follow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet once we determine that it is appropriate to begin doing so."
5,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’ll have more to say about our interest rate decision and our balance sheet policy, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook."
6,CHAIR YELLEN,"Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded, resulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year."
7,CHAIR YELLEN,"Household spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been supported by solid fundamentals, including ongoing improvement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth."
8,CHAIR YELLEN,"Business investment, which was weak for much of last year, has continued to expand."
9,CHAIR YELLEN,"And exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth."
10,CHAIR YELLEN,"Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years."
11,CHAIR YELLEN,"In the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of the year—a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above June 14, 2017 estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
12,CHAIR YELLEN,"The unemployment Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate has fallen about ½ percentage point since the beginning of the year and was 4.3 percent in May, a low level by historical standards and modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
13,CHAIR YELLEN,Broader measures of labor market utilization have also improved this year.
14,CHAIR YELLEN,"Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years."
15,CHAIR YELLEN,"Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market."
16,CHAIR YELLEN,"Looking ahead, we expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further."
17,CHAIR YELLEN,"Turning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.7 percent in April, up from less than 1 percent last summer but down somewhat over the past few months."
18,CHAIR YELLEN,Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has also edged lower.
19,CHAIR YELLEN,"The recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appear to be one-off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs."
20,CHAIR YELLEN,"These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12-month inflation figures until the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation."
21,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective."
22,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent inflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
23,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me now turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.
24,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views June 14, 2017 of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL many factors that shape the outlook."
25,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2.2 percent this year and edges down to 1.9 percent by 2019, slightly above its estimated longer-run rate."
26,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
27,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
28,CHAIR YELLEN,"Compared with the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moderately lower path, and inflation—although marked down this year for reasons I mentioned earlier—is unchanged over the following two years."
29,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent."
30,CHAIR YELLEN,"Returning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability."
31,CHAIR YELLEN,Our decision today continues this process.
32,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.
33,CHAIR YELLEN,"That’s based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level—that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel."
34,CHAIR YELLEN,"Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance."
35,CHAIR YELLEN,"But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely June 14, 2017 to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion."
36,CHAIR YELLEN,"Even so, the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades."
37,CHAIR YELLEN,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
38,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, about in line with its estimated longer-run value."
39,CHAIR YELLEN,"Compared with the projections made in March, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged."
40,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks."
41,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I’ve noted previously, policy is not on a preset course."
42,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me now turn to our balance sheet.
43,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I noted in our policy statement, we are continuing to maintain the size of our balance sheet by reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities."
44,CHAIR YELLEN,"Provided that the economy evolves broadly as the Committee anticipates, we currently expect to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year."
45,CHAIR YELLEN,"Consistent with the principles and plans we released in 2014, this program would gradually decrease our reinvestments and initiate a gradual and largely predictable decline in our securities holdings."
46,CHAIR YELLEN,The addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that we released today provides further information.
47,CHAIR YELLEN,"For both Treasury and agency securities, we will reinvest proceeds from our holdings only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps on the reductions in our securities holdings."
48,CHAIR YELLEN,"Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels—$6 billion per June 14, 2017 month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies."
49,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, any proceeds exceeding those Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL amounts would be reinvested."
50,CHAIR YELLEN,These caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the normalization process.
51,CHAIR YELLEN,"By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains."
52,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I previously noted, when our securities holdings begin to gradually decline, so too will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system."
53,CHAIR YELLEN,"At some point, probably a few years down the road, the Committee will bring the decline in our balance sheet to an end as the quantity of reserves is normalized."
54,CHAIR YELLEN,"I can’t tell you what the longer-run normal level of reserve balances will be because that will depend on the Committee’s eventual decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as-yet unknown elements, including the banking system’s future demand for reserves and various factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves."
55,CHAIR YELLEN,What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.
56,CHAIR YELLEN,"As readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed potential long-run frameworks for implementing monetary policy."
57,CHAIR YELLEN,"Decisions about the appropriate long-run framework do not need to be made for quite some time, and our future deliberations will benefit from the experience we will gain during the normalization process."
58,CHAIR YELLEN,"At this point, I’ll just point out that our current system is working well and has some important advantages."
59,CHAIR YELLEN,"In particular, it is simple and efficient to operate, does not require active management of the supply of reserves, and, most importantly, provides good control over the June 14, 2017 federal funds rate and effective transmission of changes in the federal funds rate to broader Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL money market rates."
60,CHAIR YELLEN,"And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller quantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the Committee’s future options for how to implement monetary policy."
61,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, as noted in today’s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
62,CHAIR YELLEN,"In other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times."
63,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate."
64,CHAIR YELLEN,"More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
65,CHAIR YELLEN,Thank you.
66,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ll now be happy to take your questions.
69,CHAIR YELLEN,"So that is something that we’ve said for some time, and I’ve previously—when I’ve been asked what “well under way” means—said that I don’t want to define that in purely quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms."
70,CHAIR YELLEN,So there’s no specific level of the federal funds rate that means we’re well under way.
71,CHAIR YELLEN,"But it’s also a question of not only the current level, but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of June 14, 2017 the federal funds rate."
72,CHAIR YELLEN,So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times.
73,CHAIR YELLEN,"Our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL outlook is that we anticipate further increases this year and next year for the federal funds rate, and our statement indicates that if the economy continues to evolve in the manner that we expect, that we would feel the conditions are in—will be in place to begin this process this year."
80,CHAIR YELLEN,"So what I’ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve out my term as Chair, which ends in early February."
81,CHAIR YELLEN,I have not had conversations with the President about future plans.
82,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I do very much hope—I know that they have been working hard to identify appropriate nominees for the open slots, and I do very much hope that there will be nominations in the not-too-distant future, and that the Senate will take those up expeditiously."
83,CHAIR YELLEN,I look forward to having a full Board.
85,CHAIR YELLEN,I really don’t have anything for you at this point.
94,CHAIR YELLEN,"So let me just say, as I emphasized in my statement and always say, monetory policy is not on a preset course."
95,CHAIR YELLEN,"We indicated in our statement today that we’re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings, particularly on core inflation."
96,CHAIR YELLEN,Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near term.
97,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market and a labor market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up."
98,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully and ensure, especially with roughly five years of inflation running under our 2 percent objective—that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed."
99,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation, and I pledge that we will do that."
100,CHAIR YELLEN,"But let me say, with respect to recent readings, it’s important not to overreact to a few readings, and data on inflation can be noisy."
101,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a huge decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs."
102,CHAIR YELLEN,"We had an exceptionally low reading on core PCE in March, and that will continue to hold down 12-month changes until that reading drops out."
103,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we are—this morning’s reading on the CPI showed weakness in a number of categories, and it’s certainly something that we will be closely monitoring in the months ahead."
104,CHAIR YELLEN,"We will—we’re focused on making our policy decisions on the medium-term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, as always, revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate."
106,CHAIR YELLEN,"So—continue, as today’s actions show, to feel that the economy is doing well, is showing resilience."
107,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have a very strong labor market, an unemployment rate that’s declined to levels we have not seen since 2001."
108,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, even with some moderation in the pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains—remains accommodative."
109,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, I—it’s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective, as our projections show we continue to expect that and believe the conditions are in place."
110,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we will monitor incoming data, obviously, and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems appropriate."
118,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations."
119,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and there’s a great deal of uncertainty about it, and it’s hard to pin down, especially given the June 14, 2017 fact that the so-called Phillips curve appears to be quite flat."
120,CHAIR YELLEN,That means that inflation doesn’t Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.
121,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, that relationship, I believe, remains at work."
122,CHAIR YELLEN,We have seen that operate historically.
123,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low, and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors, but we certainly haven’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation."
124,CHAIR YELLEN,"In light of that, the Committee has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment, and in this projection, it’s moved down to 4.6 percent, a tenth lower than it was last time."
125,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, while the unemployment rate is below that, it’s not that much—it’s not that much below it."
130,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the expected policy changes, such as changes to tax policy or fiscal policy more generally."
131,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would say that, based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts, that I haven’t seen very much evidence that, thus far, expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending."
132,CHAIR YELLEN,So I really wouldn’t expect any significant pullback.
133,CHAIR YELLEN,"Many of our business contacts—I think their June 14, 2017 confidence remains high."
134,CHAIR YELLEN,"They’ve not really changed their plans yet, and they have a wait-and-Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL see attitude."
141,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many different factors into account."
142,CHAIR YELLEN,We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year.
143,CHAIR YELLEN,That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions.
144,CHAIR YELLEN,"There’s been a modest decrease recently in the value of the dollar, although it’s up substantially since mid-2014."
145,CHAIR YELLEN,So we take those factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.
146,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have done that, and—but other things also affect the stance of policy."
147,CHAIR YELLEN,So there really can’t be any simple relationship.
148,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re not targeting financial conditions.
149,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’re trying to set a path of the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don’t show up in a financial conditions index."
150,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our mandated objectives.
156,CHAIR YELLEN,So I don’t think central bank credibility—at least the Fed’s credibility—has been impaired.
157,CHAIR YELLEN,We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations.
158,CHAIR YELLEN,"Professional forecasters—whether it’s in the Blue Chip or the Survey of Professional Forecasters, those expectations have remained quite steady and in close alignment with our 2 percent inflation target."
159,CHAIR YELLEN,TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation do not provide straight reads on market participants’ estimates and expectations about inflation.
160,CHAIR YELLEN,They embody other elements—risk premia and liquidity premia as well.
161,CHAIR YELLEN,"They had moved down and now have moved—they remain at low levels, but they have moved back up again."
162,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is true that some household surveys of inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’t say that we’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expectations."
163,CHAIR YELLEN,"But you asked also, I guess, about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process, and that certainly is possible."
164,CHAIR YELLEN,And estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate—they are quite uncertain.
165,CHAIR YELLEN,I agree with your assessment there.
166,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re really not certain what they are.
167,CHAIR YELLEN,And policy is not being—is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.
168,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.
169,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess, even with the moderation of the level that’s needed to provide for new entrants in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy."
170,CHAIR YELLEN,"With policy accommodative, all that we’re doing in raising rates is moving—removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace."
171,CHAIR YELLEN,And I see that as appropriate.
172,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’re not moving so aggressively as to put a brake on continued improvement in the labor June 14, 2017 market."
173,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market."
174,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight."
175,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk."
176,CHAIR YELLEN,We want to keep the expansion on a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need—we find ourselves in a situation where we’ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a recession.
177,CHAIR YELLEN,"So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the Committee believes, is an appropriate management of risks."
178,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, that we’ve faced that situation now for a long time, and it’s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective, and it’s a symmetric objective."
179,CHAIR YELLEN,So that’s a risk that we face as well.
180,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that’s also a risk."
181,CHAIR YELLEN,"And those things point, I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation."
186,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, at the time that we adopted the 2 percent target—it was back in 2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be."
187,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, you know, I believe that was a well-thought-out decision."
188,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, at the moment, we are highly focused on trying to achieve our 2 percent objective."
189,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below, and it’s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective."
190,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, we’ve learned a lot in the meantime, and assessments of the level of the neutral likely level, currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years."
191,CHAIR YELLEN,And that means that the economy is—has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.
192,CHAIR YELLEN,"So it’s that recognition that causes people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that’s an important set—this is one of our most critical decisions and one we are attentive to evidence and outside thinking."
193,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s one that we will be reconsidering at some future time.
194,CHAIR YELLEN,And it’s important for our decisions to be informed by a wide range of views and research which is ongoing inside and outside the Fed.
195,CHAIR YELLEN,"But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in—potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential costs that could be associated with it."
196,CHAIR YELLEN,It needs to be a balanced assessment.
197,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I would say that this is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future, and we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this."
205,CHAIR YELLEN,"So let me first say, it’s not straightforward to determine exactly what expectations are embodied in market prices because there are term premia that affect these rates, and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read."
206,CHAIR YELLEN,"That said, in part, expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it’s likely to evolve over time."
207,CHAIR YELLEN,"And views have changed about that over time, and there is a good deal of uncertainty about it."
208,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range of uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out."
209,CHAIR YELLEN,"There’s a good deal of uncertainty and—that reflects the, like—all the shocks that can affect the evolution of the economy, and also the fact, we’re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely—what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate."
210,CHAIR YELLEN,So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations.
211,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the median now stands at around 3 percent, but we have uncertainty about that."
212,CHAIR YELLEN,Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is lower than that.
213,CHAIR YELLEN,"And as I said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years."
214,CHAIR YELLEN,"But that remains uncertain, and I think that’s something that market participants are trying to assess, and we will be as well."
216,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, our expectations are little changed."
217,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, the projections we released today are essentially identical to those."
218,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I think the market is aware of the views of June 14, 2017 participants and is assessing evidence itself to form their own views."
219,CHAIR YELLEN,"And it’s important that the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL market take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy."
220,CHAIR YELLEN,So it’s not an unhealthy thing to have such a gap.
221,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, as I just said, our own views are not set in stone but are likely to evolve as well over time."
228,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since our—at least since our 2014 normalization principles, that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way."
229,CHAIR YELLEN,And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved.
230,CHAIR YELLEN,"And today’s announcement is another step in providing further details about how we plan to proceed so that when this plan does go into effect, no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work."
231,CHAIR YELLEN,I think that we—the plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan.
232,CHAIR YELLEN,"My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it’s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our June 14, 2017 balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it’s something that the Committee Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL will not be reconsidering from time to time."
233,CHAIR YELLEN,"We think this is a workable plan, and it will, as one of my colleagues, President Harker, described it, it will be like watching paint dry, that this will just be something that runs quietly in the background."
234,CHAIR YELLEN,So that’s my expectation and our intention.
235,CHAIR YELLEN,"Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surprise and a substantial reaction, that is something we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy."
243,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, with respect to the impact of credit conditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I’ve previously, in testifying, indicated that I don’t think that our regulations have played an important role, at least broadly speaking, in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy."
244,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that credit growth continues to be healthy, including among small—smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden."
245,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that impedes credit growth."
246,CHAIR YELLEN,"And when banks are strong, they’re in a much better position to lend."
247,CHAIR YELLEN,So that’s been a view that I’ve stated previously.
248,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday, a detailed report."
249,CHAIR YELLEN,And that’s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it.
250,CHAIR YELLEN,"I haven’t had a chance to review it thoroughly, so I don’t want to comment on too many details."
251,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I would say it underscores the importance of capital, liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning in having a safe and sound banking system, which are views that I and my colleagues have long espoused."
252,CHAIR YELLEN,"Regulatory burden, when it’s possible to ease it, and a good deal of the Treasury report is focused on regulatory burden, that’s something that all regulators should be looking to do."
253,CHAIR YELLEN,"We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks."
254,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, looking for ways, for example, to simplify capital requirements for community banks."
255,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we’ll continue in that direction and, in that sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury report."
256,CHAIR YELLEN,So there are a number of areas and suggestions where our thinking aligns well.
257,CHAIR YELLEN,"There is probably some areas where we’re likely to have differences but quite—you know, quite a number of areas where we’re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those recommendations."
259,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I have felt that it’s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time."
260,CHAIR YELLEN,"We are in the process of, as the economy strengthens, normalizing interest rates."
261,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, certainly, we’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low."
262,CHAIR YELLEN,I thought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.
270,CHAIR YELLEN,So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced warning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare.
271,CHAIR YELLEN,And today’s announcement is another step in that process.
272,CHAIR YELLEN,So we certainly wanted to get this information out before we actually undertake the beginning of this plan.
273,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, you know, as the statement says, we’ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but—the timing of initiating the plan."
274,CHAIR YELLEN,"But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, which, you know, we will be watching—always are—we could put this into effect relatively soon."
275,CHAIR YELLEN,"You asked about whether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would say, we’ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of conditions."
281,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we have previously suggested exempting community banks, smaller banks, entirely from the rule."
282,CHAIR YELLEN,And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the Volcker rule.
283,CHAIR YELLEN,"Implementation of it is frankly complex, and I’m certainly open to looking at ways to reduce regulatory burden in that area."
284,CHAIR YELLEN,The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.
285,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see."
286,CHAIR YELLEN,"But on implementation, it’s true that the rules were—in part reflecting the way the legislation is written—were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might simplify the rule, and certainly it’s something we’re quite open to looking at."
288,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I mean, Treasury has a—set out a list of objectives for regulation that I’m sympathetic to and endorse."
289,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory burden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating systemic risk, that’s something that all regulators should want to do."
290,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ve done an awful lot of rule writing over the last five or six years.
291,CHAIR YELLEN,"And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is an objective that is core to the Treasury review and that we are very sympathetic with."
292,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, while we may not agree on every detail, certainly the suggestions that are made there are ones that we will pay attention to and in many cases are already on our own list of things we should review."
300,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, thanks."
301,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s a great question.
302,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, staff in the Federal Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE."
303,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, so-called term premiums embedded in longer-term interest rates."
304,CHAIR YELLEN,"There’s disagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it’s something that’s difficult to pin down."
305,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the contrary."
306,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, that was never my expectation, but I do remember when people were afraid that that would happen."
307,CHAIR YELLEN,We do have the tools.
308,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have, you know, even with a large balance sheet—we intend to shrink our balance sheet now, but even with a large balance sheet, we retain the ability to move the fed funds rate and set it as appropriate for the needs of the economy."
309,CHAIR YELLEN,So I think we have learned that it works.
310,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s a valuable part of the toolkit.
311,CHAIR YELLEN,"It’s something that, if we were to encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where—I’ve said we want the fed funds rate and movements in short-term interest rates, that’s our go-to number one main policy tool—but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe, based on the evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit."
312,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we have said in the June 14, 2017 bullets that we released today on our balance sheet that in such of—an episode of such extreme Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL weakness in the future, those are things we would consider going forward."
315,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, we’ve had no discussion of that issue, you know."
316,CHAIR YELLEN,And our focus now is on getting it back to a more normal size.
317,CHAIR YELLEN,"But I would say, the use of QE in the United States relative to the size of our economy is not as high as it’s been in some other countries that have employed it."
318,CHAIR YELLEN,But that’s something we haven’t seriously even discussed.
324,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I’m not going to comment on the President’s budget, and these programs can be undertaken at many different levels."
325,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ve seen many nonprofits and states and local authorities put in place programs that looked to me to be successful.
326,CHAIR YELLEN,I do think we have a tight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they’re finding difficulty identifying workers with the appropriate skills.
327,CHAIR YELLEN,"In my own discussions with businesses, what I hear more of—and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market—larger firms are spending more on training and trying to, given that they can’t hire workers with the ideal skills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available."
328,CHAIR YELLEN,"What I hear from CEOs of smaller June 14, 2017 firms is that they don’t have the ability to launch such programs."
329,CHAIR YELLEN,"They would really very much Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL like to participate along, for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such programs launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training."
330,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you know, existed for a long time—downward pressure on wages and job opportunities, especially for those with less skills—I think that this is something that deserves priority."
