0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
1,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective."
5,CHAIR POWELL,I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today’s decision.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the June 19, 2019 global economy."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments."
15,CHAIR POWELL,These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data.
16,CHAIR POWELL,Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well.
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this backdrop, inflation remains muted."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation."
19,CHAIR POWELL,Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened.
20,CHAIR POWELL,"Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with the outlook for jobs and growth."
21,CHAIR POWELL,Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Monthly job gains in May were lower than expected, however, and, in light of recent developments, this bears watching."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Still, many labor market indicators remain strong."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better, and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimates of longer-run normal growth."
27,CHAIR POWELL,The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth.
28,CHAIR POWELL,"Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting."
29,CHAIR POWELL,"As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"The more reliable drivers of growth in the June 19, 2019 economy are spending on consumption and business investment."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"While consumption was weak Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1 Moreover, manufacturing production has posted declines so far this year."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter."
35,CHAIR POWELL,Data since then show some pickup.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components, is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"Setting aside short-term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold inflation down around the world."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting, and some survey-based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges."
44,CHAIR POWELL,Combining these 1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"June 19, 2019 factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL sustained shortfall of inflation."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment."
47,CHAIR POWELL,The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Though some participants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting."
49,CHAIR POWELL,This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflation’s return to our objective.
50,CHAIR POWELL,Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.
51,CHAIR POWELL,"It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment."
52,CHAIR POWELL,Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.
53,CHAIR POWELL,"Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion."
54,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
55,CHAIR POWELL,I will be pleased to take your questions.
60,CHAIR POWELL,"So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy."
61,CHAIR POWELL,"And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we’re going to be monitoring—monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we’ve mentioned, but that June 19, 2019 we’d like to see more going forward."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"Particularly, we’d like to see whether these risks continue Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL to weigh on the outlook."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates."
64,CHAIR POWELL,Eight actually wrote down rate cuts.
65,CHAIR POWELL,A number of others see that the case has strengthened.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned."
67,CHAIR POWELL,And I also mentioned that some of these—some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage.
68,CHAIR POWELL,And so we do expect that we’ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term.
69,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s our focus.
71,CHAIR POWELL,I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting.
72,CHAIR POWELL,I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.
73,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’ll learn a great deal more about them.
74,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that’s—we think that that’s the right way to move here.
75,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So we want to see—we want to see and we want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine, and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment, which can be volatile."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we are—we’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion."
83,CHAIR POWELL,"Yeah, so I would say that we’re not looking at any one thing."
84,CHAIR POWELL,I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period.
85,CHAIR POWELL,But we’re also looking at global growth.
86,CHAIR POWELL,It’s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds.
87,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.
88,CHAIR POWELL,Risks seem to have grown.
89,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that’s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer: Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up."
90,CHAIR POWELL,"We do see, though, some areas that we’re looking at, such as, I mentioned, business fixed income.2 So—also, the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’t like to look at one job report."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching."
92,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.
93,CHAIR POWELL,"We expect to learn a good deal more, as I mentioned."
94,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"And then, in the end, we’ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it."
102,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt, though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more."
104,CHAIR POWELL,And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term.
105,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.
106,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, as a general matter, it’s always something that we have to weigh."
107,CHAIR POWELL,But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I’ve always believed that."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"And I feel like you make better decisions when you June 19, 2019 hear a disparity of views."
118,CHAIR POWELL,So I really do look at it that way.
119,CHAIR POWELL,"I would add, though, that the support Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic—their mandates are domestic, and they’re focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint."
124,CHAIR POWELL,"And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks."
125,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s our principal focus.
126,CHAIR POWELL,So it could cut either way.
127,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support—tend to support activity.3 So we’re really focused on, you know, the risks to our—on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks."
128,CHAIR POWELL,That’s our principal focus.
137,CHAIR POWELL,That’s the inflation question.
139,CHAIR POWELL,I’m saying you— HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"On def—no, the fact that you’ve signaled rate cuts are coming."
142,CHAIR POWELL,I see.
143,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, right."
144,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
145,CHAIR POWELL,So let me let me answer the inflation question first.
146,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here.
147,CHAIR POWELL,"We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped."
148,CHAIR POWELL,We noted that also in the statement.
149,CHAIR POWELL,And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.
150,CHAIR POWELL,So we find that notable.
151,CHAIR POWELL,"Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths."
152,CHAIR POWELL,So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.
153,CHAIR POWELL,"Let me say, on inflation, it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time."
154,CHAIR POWELL,It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, then, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation."
156,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, you know, we certainly don’t want to be seen as weak on inflation, and I don't believe we are."
157,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the dots, you’re right, this is the first time, I believe, we’ve had—we’ve talked about cutting in the “dot era.” I guess the dot era began in January 2012."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re working our way through it."
159,CHAIR POWELL,And I think it’s just something we do.
160,CHAIR POWELL,"You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they’re also only the most likely case."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty, there’s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely."
163,CHAIR POWELL,But that doesn’t show up in the dot.
164,CHAIR POWELL,The dot is either one thing or it’s another.
165,CHAIR POWELL,"So I just would say that, if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"On the specific question of that, that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk June 19, 2019 picture as we move forward."
172,CHAIR POWELL,So it would be—so nothing I can say about that is specific to the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL near-term question that we face.
173,CHAIR POWELL,"More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
175,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.
176,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it’s well understood to be correct."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I don’t know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy, not the Fed, and we don’t comment, in that sense, on the level of the dollar."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use our tools to achieve that."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"June 19, 2019 Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions, and one of those is the dollar, but Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL we don’t target the dollar."
188,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just something that we don’t do.
189,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, central banks—or, rather, nations, when they get together, routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic, economic, and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago."
190,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention.
196,CHAIR POWELL,"And, I would say, there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting."
197,CHAIR POWELL,"There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"But all of those, but apparently one, felt that it would be better to see more to—before moving."
199,CHAIR POWELL,And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"First, it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And we will act as needed, including promptly, if that’s appropriate, and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion."
213,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"Well, you gave a pretty good picture."
214,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it."
215,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"But I would say, the big pieces of it are this: The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter."
216,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,That is coming true.
217,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense."
218,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,You’ve got a tight labor market.
219,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.
220,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.
221,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,You’ve got wages going up.
222,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,You’ve got high levels of household confidence.
223,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid."
224,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry—level of entry into the workforce."
225,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,So that part of the economy is solid.
226,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world."
227,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker."
228,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not solely a domestic issue, and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage."
229,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.
230,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their own way.
231,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"So there—lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment, although they’re also leading to lower gas prices, which supports spending."
232,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"So there are many, many things."
233,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,There isn’t any one thing that explains it all.
234,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s something that June 19, 2019 we’re watching."
235,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see."
236,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,Then you see the crosscurrents.
237,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture.
238,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL,"And I think what that picture—what we took away from that picture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these risks, and what we want to do is, we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, we have the tools we have, and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity."
245,CHAIR POWELL,And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others.
246,CHAIR POWELL,But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.
247,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that."
248,CHAIR POWELL,"The reason why we say “sustain the expansion” is, you’re seeing now, for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t June 19, 2019 been earlier."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re 10 years deep into this, and that’s something we heard quite a lot at the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL conference in Chicago on the review."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"And I just would say, that’s why we think—it’s one of the reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time."
252,CHAIR POWELL,"So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don’t—we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals—maximum employment, stable prices—is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response."
254,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s just how we look at it.
259,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would just say that we are—at the Fed, we’re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that."
266,CHAIR POWELL,Digital currencies are in their infancy.
267,CHAIR POWELL,"So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re—you know, it’s something we’re looking at."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology, and there’s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, there are potential benefits here."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"There are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, that could potentially have large application."
273,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations, from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do decide to go forward with something."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have—we don’t have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such."
276,CHAIR POWELL,They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that.
277,CHAIR POWELL,"But, I would say that, you know, through international forums, you know, we have significant input into the payment system and, as you know, play an important role in the payment system here in the United States."
288,CHAIR POWELL,We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation.
289,CHAIR POWELL,We did say that.
290,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent."
291,CHAIR POWELL,Our statutory mandate is price stability.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular."
294,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a new thing for us.
295,CHAIR POWELL,It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.
296,CHAIR POWELL,"It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve."
298,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier this month, with seven papers written and criticized, and leading global experts."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"But I’ll just say, again, that the heart of the conference was the two panels on—with practitioners in low and moderate income—who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"And they were—there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is June 19, 2019 and what it means in their communities."
301,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the idea being, they haven’t had, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL a bull market in these communities."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"They haven’t had, just, a booming economy."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"And just now, you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the—providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—some people recommended that we just talk to, you know, econ Ph.D.’s about this, but, no, that’s not what we chose to do, and we’re glad this is the choice we made."
311,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think it’s—I don’t think it’s a practical alternative.
312,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ll tell you why.
313,CHAIR POWELL,I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.
314,CHAIR POWELL,You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their—close to their objective.
315,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but it’s quite challenging to get inflation—it’s been—even with very high levels of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to target in a sustained, symmetric kind of a way."
317,CHAIR POWELL,So saying that you’re going to go for 4 percent—I wonder how credible that will be.
326,CHAIR POWELL,"So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that’s what came out of the GAO review."
327,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story.
328,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"So, this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know, the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals."
330,CHAIR POWELL,And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.
331,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is, whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be."
333,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running—you know, running on their own books and to themselves and to each other."
334,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in that, I feel—I feel like that is—that’s in a good place, but we never—we never say “Mission accomplished” on that."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"We will keep—you know, keep monitoring that carefully."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"What’s happened, though, is, the paper is now owned by market-based vehicles: collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds, and things like that."
337,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we now have—you know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"And we—you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"And they’re actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there’s no run risk, but there’s still macroeconomic risk."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is looking at."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it’s not really a financial stability risk, in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think the issue isn’t that the banks don’t understand what the rules are."
347,CHAIR POWELL,The issue is that the risk isn’t in the banks.
348,CHAIR POWELL,It’s in—it’s out in those market-based vehicles.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t, I don’t—you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running."
353,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re very carefully assessing that.
354,CHAIR POWELL,"And we June 19, 2019 continue to take all these risks seriously."
355,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL weeks ago, so."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force."
363,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate is lower.
364,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place."
365,CHAIR POWELL,You mentioned wages.
366,CHAIR POWELL,"So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be, in the sense that it’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"So what’s, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know, long into a cycle, let’s say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we watch—we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re, you know, that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ve all lived through—you know, when I got to the Fed, we were in the 8 percent–plus range, and it’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’t seen wages picked up."
370,CHAIR POWELL,You haven’t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"You have June 19, 2019 seen a tightening labor market."
372,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it—the surveys that I mentioned will all show that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the labor market has tightened, but not overtightened."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet."
377,CHAIR POWELL,Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.
378,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say this: If we do provide more accommodation—again, we haven’t really addressed this—but if we do provide more accommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year, which is that we’ll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so that it serves our dual-mandate objectives."
379,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
