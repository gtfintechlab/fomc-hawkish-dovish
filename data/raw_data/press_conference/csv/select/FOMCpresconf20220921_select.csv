0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
2,CHAIR POWELL,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
3,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate."
7,CHAIR POWELL,We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.
8,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
9,CHAIR POWELL,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
19,CHAIR POWELL,The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of the year.
20,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer-run normal level."
23,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our 2 percent longer-run goal.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index was 8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent."
26,CHAIR POWELL,Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year-earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia’s war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4 percent this year and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025."
29,CHAIR POWELL,Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
32,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
33,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3¼ percent."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
38,CHAIR POWELL,We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
41,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
42,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.
43,CHAIR POWELL,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
44,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage point higher than projected in June."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
47,CHAIR POWELL,We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
48,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
49,CHAIR POWELL,"Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions."
50,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
51,CHAIR POWELL,We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.
52,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
53,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
54,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
55,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
60,CHAIR POWELL,"So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole."
61,CHAIR POWELL,"The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two things, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year."
65,CHAIR POWELL,"On the second, though, so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"And in light of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said, we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question."
69,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be looking at a few things.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent."
71,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what we’ll be looking for.
72,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that."
79,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
80,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions."
83,CHAIR POWELL,"Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months."
84,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.
85,CHAIR POWELL,So we are very much mindful for that.
86,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
87,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we think about that.
92,CHAIR POWELL,I should know better than to answer your second question.
93,CHAIR POWELL,[Laughter] STEVE LIESMAN.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, there you go."
97,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
98,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold.
99,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, those will evolve over time, and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes."
102,CHAIR POWELL,"There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay there for a time."
103,CHAIR POWELL,But we’re not at that level.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"Clearly, today we’re, we’ve just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and the view of the Committee, there’s a ways to go."
112,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
113,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways, and I’ll mention a couple of those."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"First—and you know these—but first, job openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s plausible, I’ll say, that job openings could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes."
118,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s one thing.
119,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there."
120,CHAIR POWELL,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability."
121,CHAIR POWELL,"And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that."
124,CHAIR POWELL,"For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events—it remains to be seen."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, we’re committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator."
135,CHAIR POWELL,"We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is."
142,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation."
143,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy.
144,CHAIR POWELL,"We also know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation."
145,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a challenging assessment.
147,CHAIR POWELL,"You look at broader financial conditions, as you know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit spreads; you look at financial conditions indexes."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"We also, I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast."
150,CHAIR POWELL,You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.
151,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations."
152,CHAIR POWELL,"I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across the yield curve, and that is also an important consideration."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points]."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there’s also, there’s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today."
162,CHAIR POWELL,So that would be 25 basis points less.
163,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting.
164,CHAIR POWELL,We didn’t make that decision today; we didn’t vote on that.
165,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say that we’re committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that’s what we’re thinking about."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing."
171,CHAIR POWELL,By now we would have thought that we’d have seen some of that.
172,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t.
173,CHAIR POWELL,"We have seen some supply-side healing, but inflation has not really come down."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent."
175,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation.
176,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s not where we expected or wanted to be.
177,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can—keep doing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to."
178,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re still discovering what that level is.
179,CHAIR POWELL,But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be.
180,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
186,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at 2.0, so that’s pretty close."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the median is, and we publish it."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s not—I mean, I would say that if, actually, if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome."
189,CHAIR POWELL,But you’re right—it is a tenth higher than 2 percent.
192,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August."
195,CHAIR POWELL,So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too much to any one data point.
196,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high."
197,CHAIR POWELL,It’s running 4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that.
198,CHAIR POWELL,"If that’s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down."
199,CHAIR POWELL,That’s how we think about it.
206,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well under way."
207,CHAIR POWELL,I would say it’s not something we’re considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term.
208,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just, it’s something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close."
210,CHAIR POWELL,"I think a number of things might affect that decision, really."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"The main thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"But we regularly discuss what we’re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it’s a very ongoing, constant kind of a process."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"So we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I can’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’s not as if we don’t think about the policy decisions—monetary policy and otherwise—the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy, as best we can."
227,CHAIR POWELL,It won’t be perfect.
228,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates.
229,CHAIR POWELL,"If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times, but, really, we’re all, we’re in very different situations."
230,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it’s not coordination, but there’s a lot of information sharing."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"And we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies—economies that are important to the United States—are doing."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing, where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down."
239,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re having an effect on interest-sensitive spending.
240,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, through exchange rates, we’re having an effect on exports and imports."
241,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—so all of that’s happening, but you’re right, and we’ve said this: This is a strong, robust economy."
242,CHAIR POWELL,People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government transfers.
243,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"The states are very flush with cash, so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range."
247,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are."
248,CHAIR POWELL,But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
251,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t fail to do that.
252,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"So for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP."
254,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we think about it.
263,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t know what the odds are.
264,CHAIR POWELL,"I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth."
266,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s very slow growth.
267,CHAIR POWELL,And then below trend next year.
268,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the median was 1.2, also well below."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a slower, that’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well."
271,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us."
273,CHAIR POWELL,I wish there were a painless way to do that.
274,CHAIR POWELL,There isn’t.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"And we certainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, we need to complete this task."
279,CHAIR POWELL,It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.
280,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’s estimate of where we think those rates would be."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, they will evolve over time."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been going up, you’re in trouble right away."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"You don’t have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum."
295,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s what we’re hearing from people is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn’t."
298,CHAIR POWELL,"We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that."
300,CHAIR POWELL,But none of that is guaranteed.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time."
302,CHAIR POWELL,We really saw that for a long time.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve."
304,CHAIR POWELL,And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time.
305,CHAIR POWELL,"To pull back from the task of doing that is, you’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s what you see us doing."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down."
314,CHAIR POWELL,And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.
315,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the economy is improving."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs."
318,CHAIR POWELL,And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.
319,CHAIR POWELL,"But, at the same time, we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era has been noted for very long expansions."
320,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve had three of the four longest in measured history since we got inflation under control.
321,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s not an accident.
322,CHAIR POWELL,"So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10-year, anyway, expansions, and you can see what we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that."
323,CHAIR POWELL,So we want to get back to that.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"But, to get there, we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time."
329,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s all of those things.
330,CHAIR POWELL,"Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve."
331,CHAIR POWELL,"But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that."
333,CHAIR POWELL,We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done.
340,CHAIR POWELL,"So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house."
342,CHAIR POWELL,That kind of thing.
343,CHAIR POWELL,So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.
344,CHAIR POWELL,Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"So the deceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again."
347,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place."
348,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market."
349,CHAIR POWELL,"As you know, we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance."
354,CHAIR POWELL,I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.
355,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"So it may take some time, so I think, hope for the best, plan for the worst."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, on shelter inflation, you’ve just got to assume that it’s going to remain pretty high for a while."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think if you look, when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation."
366,CHAIR POWELL,And that could be—you pick your measure.
367,CHAIR POWELL,It could be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get is a positive number.
368,CHAIR POWELL,"In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but—I mean, I don’t know exactly what it would be."
370,CHAIR POWELL,But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"And let me say, we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate."
372,CHAIR POWELL,The path that we actually execute will be enough.
373,CHAIR POWELL,It will be enough to restore price stability.
374,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is something that, as you can see, they’ve moved up, and we’re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go."
375,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
