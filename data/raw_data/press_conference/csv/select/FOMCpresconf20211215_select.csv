0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, in light of the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Aggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose[s] risks to the outlook."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapid growth."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent next year."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate has declined substantially—falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last December 15, 2021 meeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"The recent improvements in labor market Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November—but remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages have also risen briskly, but, thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put December 15, 2021 upward pressure on inflation."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL levels closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal by the end of next year."
28,CHAIR POWELL,The median inflation projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in September.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
30,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to our price-stability goal.
31,CHAIR POWELL,We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.
32,CHAIR POWELL,We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
33,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
34,CHAIR POWELL,"In support of these goals, the Committee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate."
35,CHAIR POWELL,We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment."
37,CHAIR POWELL,All FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year.
38,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9 percent at the end of 2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Participants expect a gradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of its longer-run level by the end of 2024."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a December 15, 2021 Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL year or more from now."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March—a few months sooner than we anticipated in early November."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes."
46,CHAIR POWELL,We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.
47,CHAIR POWELL,"And, even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
49,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
50,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.
51,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
52,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
63,CHAIR POWELL,"So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force."
65,CHAIR POWELL,We’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers.
66,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a—that’s a judgment for the Committee to make.
67,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"Unlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates, it’s a broad range of things."
69,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment."
70,CHAIR POWELL,"And you see that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned."
80,CHAIR POWELL,Markets can be sensitive to it.
81,CHAIR POWELL,And we thought that this was—this was a doubling of the speed.
82,CHAIR POWELL,We’re basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper.
83,CHAIR POWELL,And we thought that was the appropriate way to go.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"So we announced it, and that’s what will happen."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s Milton Friedman’s famous statement."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"And I do think that in this world, where everything is—where the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"And my own sense is that they get into—financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"Shorter than that, rather."
90,CHAIR POWELL,"But in addition, when we communicate about what we’re going to do, the markets move immediately [in response] to that."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"They, they change on the expectation of things happening."
94,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t think it’s a question of having to wait.
98,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
99,CHAIR POWELL,"The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"Since we’re two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as, as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then, then what we—you would stop the taper potentially sooner."
101,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s not something I expect to happen.
102,CHAIR POWELL,"But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate, and we—and we don’t find ourselves in a situation where we—where we might have to raise rates while we’re still purchasing assets."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, no, I wouldn’t say that’s our position at all."
112,CHAIR POWELL,We really haven’t taken a position on that.
113,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say that we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example."
114,CHAIR POWELL,"And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet, last time."
115,CHAIR POWELL,And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time, and that those—the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet."
117,CHAIR POWELL,And the same thing would be true about raising rates.
118,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very December 15, 2021 extended wait at this time."
119,CHAIR POWELL,The economy is so much stronger.
120,CHAIR POWELL,I was here at the Fed when we Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL lifted off the last time.
121,CHAIR POWELL,"And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential."
123,CHAIR POWELL,There wouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay.
124,CHAIR POWELL,"Having said that, I—you know, we’ll make this decision in coming meetings, and it’s not—it’s not a decision that the Committee has really focused on yet."
133,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
134,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020."
135,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think early on, that was—the sense was that that’s where we were headed."
136,CHAIR POWELL,"The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different."
137,CHAIR POWELL,"And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic."
138,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say: Look, we’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly."
139,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"The way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor force participation, of course, where we had widely thought—I had certainly thought—that, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force participation."
141,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ve begun to see some improvement.
142,CHAIR POWELL,We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report.
143,CHAIR POWELL,But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer.
144,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now."
145,CHAIR POWELL,"So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in."
146,CHAIR POWELL,"But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors."
147,CHAIR POWELL,"But the reality is, we don’t have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we have to make policy now."
149,CHAIR POWELL,And inflation is well above target.
150,CHAIR POWELL,So this is something we need to take into—take into account.
153,CHAIR POWELL,So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made.
154,CHAIR POWELL,But you’re really asking a question about how our framework works.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"And, yes, there is a—there’s a provision, it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision, that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the December 15, 2021 price-stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and the—and the speed at which we’re approaching it."
156,CHAIR POWELL,"And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp” which could, in concept, be taken and it’s in our framework, it’s been in our framework a long time."
157,CHAIR POWELL,I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions.
158,CHAIR POWELL,"It, it is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment."
159,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, we’re—as I said, we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my thinking, in my opinion."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that, that paragraph."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework—and has been, really, for a very long time."
173,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we—why we called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—we, we follow the same experts and I—we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the—you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from December 15, 2021 existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease."
175,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a first draft.
176,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL We’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be.
177,CHAIR POWELL,It may well come to the United States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly.
178,CHAIR POWELL,That could easily happen.
179,CHAIR POWELL,"I think there’s another step there, though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the economy."
180,CHAIR POWELL,"And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down."
182,CHAIR POWELL,We’re having quite a wave of Delta.
183,CHAIR POWELL,"So coming in on top of that, again, it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this."
185,CHAIR POWELL,More and more people are getting vaccinated.
186,CHAIR POWELL,"So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in the aggregate, people who are not vaccinated."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect."
188,CHAIR POWELL,It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect.
189,CHAIR POWELL,Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring.
190,CHAIR POWELL,And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains.
191,CHAIR POWELL,And that sort of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out.
192,CHAIR POWELL,So it can have an economic effect.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"I just think, at this point, we don’t know much."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll know a whole lot more in three weeks, and we’ll know more than that in six weeks."
197,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
198,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, look, I think—if you look at the state of the economy and the amount—the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"I think moving, you know, moving forward the end of our taper by a few months is really—is really an appropriate thing to do."
200,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, really, Omicron doesn’t really have much to do with that."
206,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a continual process, really."
209,CHAIR POWELL,In the late spring last year.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"And we had a view—it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be temporary."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it."
212,CHAIR POWELL,"And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward."
216,CHAIR POWELL,We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been planned.
217,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy.
218,CHAIR POWELL,"So coming to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting—it was the Friday before the November meeting—and it was very high, 5.7 percent reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we should increase our taper, [We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had “socialized.” Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot, high reading."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to—we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper."
222,CHAIR POWELL,And we went to work on that.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s really what happened."
224,CHAIR POWELL,It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market.
225,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, as you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, this, this move."
229,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s—so far, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing."
232,CHAIR POWELL,"As you look forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get December 15, 2021 working again, and maybe there’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"But Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL what, what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently—[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices."
235,CHAIR POWELL,It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen.
236,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t see that yet.
237,CHAIR POWELL,"But with the kind of hot labor market readings—wages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important."
239,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, owners’ equivalent rent."
240,CHAIR POWELL,That’s another thing which is very economically sensitive.
241,CHAIR POWELL,"Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now, this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up."
243,CHAIR POWELL,And we need to keep our eyes on those things.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not something we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be."
255,CHAIR POWELL,"People write down their, their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on December 15, 2021 their economic forecast."
256,CHAIR POWELL,"And so the median—what you’re talking about, the three rate increases, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that’s the median of the Committee—the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year."
257,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a really strong economy.
258,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate."
259,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we—no one will say, “Oh, we can’t change our policy because we wrote something down in December.” No one’s ever said that or will."
260,CHAIR POWELL,It will—the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast.
261,CHAIR POWELL,"So, for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. MICHELLE SMITH."
263,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
264,CHAIR POWELL,Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.
275,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
276,CHAIR POWELL,So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework.
277,CHAIR POWELL,This was—it really was a completely different thing.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate-sensitive, and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars, But it can’t, because they don’t have semiconductors."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"So, so that—it was a very different kind of inflation."
281,CHAIR POWELL,This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all.
282,CHAIR POWELL,It’s nothing to do with our framework.
283,CHAIR POWELL,And our—the way we’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework.
284,CHAIR POWELL,"But coming to maximum employment, which is really your question."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"When you—if you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is wages."
288,CHAIR POWELL,It’s one of the things you look at.
289,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it’s—So I mentioned a number of other things."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"And wages, that’s, that’s really one of the great signals."
292,CHAIR POWELL,The quits rate is another one.
293,CHAIR POWELL,"The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like they can get a better job."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"And there’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that going on—suggesting, again, that you’ve got a very tight labor market."
295,CHAIR POWELL,"So on wages, that’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data, whether we’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum December 15, 2021 employment."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"And so that’s, that’s how we think about it."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"But the—one of the complications is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that, again, we’ve got to make policy in real time."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what’s max—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is, is one way to think about it."
302,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I—absolutely."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I think—well, whether or not we—whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"So I—we would certainly—we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time."
307,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve got to make that assessment in real time.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever ran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even hotter."
319,CHAIR POWELL,"So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all of them probably have some, you know, some validity."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"Part of it will be that people—for certain people, they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable or they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere."
321,CHAIR POWELL,That’s one thing.
322,CHAIR POWELL,"The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children, but for older people."
323,CHAIR POWELL,"It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people’s portfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family."
324,CHAIR POWELL,The same thing with people’s houses.
325,CHAIR POWELL,"People buy—they have a mortgage, you know, with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled."
326,CHAIR POWELL,And they might make—reach the same conclusion.
327,CHAIR POWELL,"So they’re—and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers."
328,CHAIR POWELL,"So, for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays—we, we have a situation where we’ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"And people—in effect, a good part of it is voluntary."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s, that’s their, certainly their choice."
331,CHAIR POWELL,"In other cases, it’s something that will abate very quickly if December 15, 2021 and when the pandemic gets under control."
332,CHAIR POWELL,"And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL maybe the less likely that people will come back because they’re—you know, they get used to their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs."
333,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s what the evidence would say."
334,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a range of things.
335,CHAIR POWELL,It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus.
336,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, usually, in every other expansion, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and, you know, we’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up."
337,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not the problem here.
338,CHAIR POWELL,"The problem is a supply-side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think it’s going to be time."
339,CHAIR POWELL,"And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic get under control."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"That would be the thing that we’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this."
344,CHAIR POWELL,And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"But—so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"So you would expect that, that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down."
347,CHAIR POWELL,"The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that—is a good one."
348,CHAIR POWELL,"And, I mean, I—What we can December 15, 2021 do is try to create the conditions."
349,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL stable labor market, where people are coming in, they’re getting into the labor force, they’re getting paid well."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"In the labor market we had before, we had, you know—the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years."
351,CHAIR POWELL,There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that.
352,CHAIR POWELL,Higher participation is one of them.
353,CHAIR POWELL,And we’d love to get back there.
354,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation."
355,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, really, it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it’s going to take some time."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been having."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the last 40 years, we’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history."
358,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see.
359,CHAIR POWELL,"And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability."
368,CHAIR POWELL,We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter.
369,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know, Edward, whether you’re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they’re getting wage increases."
370,CHAIR POWELL,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation."
371,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really significantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong."
372,CHAIR POWELL,There may be something in the seasonality that this year’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.
373,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, there may be effects from, from Delta and there might be going forward from Omicron."
374,CHAIR POWELL,"But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter."
381,CHAIR POWELL,"So, actually, I’m looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a significant—you know, in an SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up."
383,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I suppose."
384,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are—which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a December 15, 2021 long track record—they’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back-end Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL of next year."
386,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect."
387,CHAIR POWELL,"There will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s the most likely case."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"I guess what—the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that’s a certainty, and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased."
391,CHAIR POWELL,It’s certainly increased.
392,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s increased."
393,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today.
394,CHAIR POWELL,[It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk.
395,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.
396,CHAIR POWELL,We need to see more data.
397,CHAIR POWELL,"We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’t get entrenched."
398,CHAIR POWELL,"For one reason, as I—as I just mentioned, it’s one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have—we have had now for a decade and more a four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can—we can hold ourselves to the same kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"And there are four key areas: asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions."
409,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say asset valuations—I’m going to go really superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"Debt owed by businesses, you know, and households—households are in very strong financial shape."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, it’s something we’re watching."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"Funding risk is, by and large, low among, among financial institutions."
414,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know, would applaud the SEC’s action this week."
415,CHAIR POWELL,"Leverage among financial institutions is low, in the sense that [their] capital is high."
416,CHAIR POWELL,"So, overall, you know, financial stability, that’s how—I wouldn’t make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces."
417,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the things, you know, that we’re—that we’re looking for, looking at, you know, it’s the—it’s the things we’ve already talked about, to some extent."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s the emergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic—if there were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy."
419,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see that.
420,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t have any basis for thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it’s certainly one we’re looking at."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most—you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with."
422,CHAIR POWELL,I think we know how to deal with bad loans and things like that.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"I think more—a cyberattack that were to take down a major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial December 15, 2021 stability risk that we haven’t actually faced yet."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"So I could go on with a list of “horribles,” but I Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL think that’s a decent picture of where I would start."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns."
429,CHAIR POWELL,"I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins."
430,CHAIR POWELL,"Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they’re properly regulated."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"And, right now, they aren’t."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections."
433,CHAIR POWELL,"The public relies on the government—and [on] the Fed, in particular—to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and—you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency."
434,CHAIR POWELL,So—but I do think those are longer term.
435,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of, you know, the more—the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really speculative assets, I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think they are risky, they’re not backed by anything, and I think there’s big consumer—issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"And there’s certainly developments in the—in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth, worth watching."
442,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say this.
443,CHAIR POWELL,"I actually think we are well positioned to deal with, with what’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come."
444,CHAIR POWELL,I do.
445,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we’ve, we’ve been adapting to the incoming data, really all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that."
446,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ve been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger."
447,CHAIR POWELL,"And now we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well, by March, in two meetings, and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"And we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, we’re going to be seeing a few more months of data."
450,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t actually think we’re out of position now.
451,CHAIR POWELL,I think this was an important move for us to make.
452,CHAIR POWELL,I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown.
453,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we’re reacting to that now.
454,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll continue to adapt our policy.
455,CHAIR POWELL,"So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.” I would look at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation."
463,CHAIR POWELL,"So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate tools."
464,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates."
465,CHAIR POWELL,Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation.
466,CHAIR POWELL,It just stops adding further accommodation.
467,CHAIR POWELL,Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance.
468,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is, is something we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet."
469,CHAIR POWELL,"We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings."
470,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think that, that—the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates."
471,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle.
472,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy."
473,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, that—as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent—3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the—you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7."
474,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is a strong economy, one in which it’s appropriate for, for interest rate hikes."
475,CHAIR POWELL,"So they’re separate, I would say."
478,CHAIR POWELL,Runoff.
480,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the December 15, 2021 meeting after that I suspect."
482,CHAIR POWELL,These are interesting issues to discuss.
483,CHAIR POWELL,[We] didn’t make any Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL decisions today.
484,CHAIR POWELL,"We looked back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was interesting and informative."
485,CHAIR POWELL,"And—but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time."
486,CHAIR POWELL,"So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start, but we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper."
487,CHAIR POWELL,But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings.
494,CHAIR POWELL,"No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment."
497,CHAIR POWELL,"So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period, and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent."
498,CHAIR POWELL,"And I—you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like—with high labor force participation, by the way."
499,CHAIR POWELL,"No one had seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades."
500,CHAIR POWELL,"And we didn’t December 15, 2021 know what the inflationary implications were."
501,CHAIR POWELL,It turned out there was barely 2 percent Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL inflation—and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing.
502,CHAIR POWELL,So we incorporated that into our framework.
503,CHAIR POWELL,This is something completely different.
504,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, that’s a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation."
505,CHAIR POWELL,This is literally the opposite.
506,CHAIR POWELL,"Or, you know, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape."
507,CHAIR POWELL,"It had nothing—so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market."
508,CHAIR POWELL,"It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress."
509,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m not making any judgments on Congress, it’s not my job."
510,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will just say, we’re coming out of a, you know, what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic—the first really global modern pandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression."
511,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy]."
512,CHAIR POWELL,"And what’s coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing."
513,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not, but, you know, the reality is, we are where we are."
514,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for the situation that we’re in."
522,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I think the short-end actions are easy to understand, which is, you know, they’re basically very [monetary] policy-sensitive rates at the short end, and it makes sense that it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy."
523,CHAIR POWELL,"I think a lot of things go into the, you know, the long rates."
524,CHAIR POWELL,And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world.
525,CHAIR POWELL,"Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’re so much lower."
526,CHAIR POWELL,"You can get—you can get, you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bunds and you can—you can hedge, hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be way ahead."
527,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in a way, it’s not surprising that there’s a lot of demand for, for U.S. sovereigns in a world—you know, in a risk-free world where, where there’s so much—they’re yielding so much more than bunds are, than JGBs."
528,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s a big part of it."
529,CHAIR POWELL,"I also think, you know, there, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is."
530,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t know about that.
531,CHAIR POWELL,"But—and I would just say that we, you know, we write down our own estimates of the—of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest."
532,CHAIR POWELL,Those are highly uncertain.
533,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ll make policy based on what we’re seeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral—what a model might say the neutral rate is."
534,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were trying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out—you know, I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens."
535,CHAIR POWELL,We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent.
536,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is.
537,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I see that it’s low."
538,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I mean, we’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we’re focused on maximum employment and price stability."
544,CHAIR POWELL,"Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that."
545,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting."
546,CHAIR POWELL,We got the labor market report two days after the meeting.
547,CHAIR POWELL,"And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading."
548,CHAIR POWELL,"It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper."
549,CHAIR POWELL,And we started working on that.
550,CHAIR POWELL,That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me.
551,CHAIR POWELL,"So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all."
552,CHAIR POWELL,And I just thought this is what we got to do.
553,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper.
554,CHAIR POWELL,And that doesn’t happen by accident.
555,CHAIR POWELL,They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision.
556,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a decision that effectively was in—more than in train and, you know, to the point where people were talking about it publicly."
557,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what happened.
558,CHAIR POWELL,And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever.
559,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve."
563,CHAIR POWELL,I didn’t push back at all.
564,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason I didn’t—and there was no—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job."
565,CHAIR POWELL,"We are not the CBO, and we’re not elected by anybody."
566,CHAIR POWELL,"So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front door, and we don’t comment—you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it’s really not our role."
567,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who’s in the White House, who’s in Congress."
568,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just—it’s just not our job and it’s something we avoid pretty, pretty assiduously."
570,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
