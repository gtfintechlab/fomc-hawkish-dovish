0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so."
2,CHAIR POWELL,We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
3,CHAIR POWELL,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.
4,CHAIR POWELL,It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
5,CHAIR POWELL,"From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
8,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
9,CHAIR POWELL,Recent indicators of spending and production have softened.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per July 27, 2022 month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Improvements in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid."
18,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.9 percent."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation."
23,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
29,CHAIR POWELL,We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
30,CHAIR POWELL,Today’s increase is the—in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then."
32,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
33,CHAIR POWELL,"As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
34,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
35,CHAIR POWELL,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
37,CHAIR POWELL,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
38,CHAIR POWELL,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return July 27, 2022 inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal."
40,CHAIR POWELL,This process is likely to involve a period of below- Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions.
41,CHAIR POWELL,But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
42,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
43,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
44,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
45,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
46,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
56,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
57,CHAIR POWELL,So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we’ve been making.
58,CHAIR POWELL,"I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate."
59,CHAIR POWELL,That was not the case at this meeting.
60,CHAIR POWELL,There was very broad support for the move that we made.
61,CHAIR POWELL,You mentioned the—the June meeting.
62,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"July 27, 2022 At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL disappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading."
70,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.
71,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we’ve done that now.
72,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re at—we’re at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral."
74,CHAIR POWELL,So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.
75,CHAIR POWELL,That’ll continue to be our overarching focus.
76,CHAIR POWELL,We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we’ll make decisions meeting by meeting.
78,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity."
80,CHAIR POWELL,And there’s some evidence that we are at this time.
81,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ll be looking at labor market July 27, 2022 conditions."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL getting better, getting closer."
83,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation."
84,CHAIR POWELL,You mentioned headline and core.
85,CHAIR POWELL,"Our mandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward."
87,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be—we’ll be looking at both.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both, really—for what they’re saying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly."
93,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"So there’s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline."
96,CHAIR POWELL,I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.
97,CHAIR POWELL,And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting.
98,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would’ve been between 3¼ and 3½ [percent]."
99,CHAIR POWELL,"And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks."
102,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that’s not a decision we’re making now."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s one that we’ll make based July 27, 2022 on the data we see."
105,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.
106,CHAIR POWELL,"We think Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL it’s—we think it’s time to just go to a meeting-by-meeting basis and not provide, you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral."
112,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months.
113,CHAIR POWELL,"And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much uncertainty."
114,CHAIR POWELL,These are not normal times.
115,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it’s quite high."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, I would—the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee’s done."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected."
118,CHAIR POWELL,"But at the same time, I would say that’s probably the best estimate of where the Committee’s thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we’ll update that, of course, at the September meeting."
119,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s really the best I can do on that.
122,CHAIR POWELL,"So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading, but this one—this one was even worse than expected, I would say."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t talk about my own personal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be."
124,CHAIR POWELL,I do—I will write down that in—it’s going to evolve.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows."
127,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll be—it’ll be a lot.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data."
129,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.
135,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this."
137,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really the question.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll be making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent."
139,CHAIR POWELL,So you would—it would depend on a lot of things.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward."
141,CHAIR POWELL,Headline inflation tends to be volatile.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile moves in commodities."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations."
144,CHAIR POWELL,The public doesn’t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.
145,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s something we have to take into consideration in our policymaking even though our tools don’t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the supply-side issues."
154,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I—as I mentioned, we think it’s necessary to have growth slow down."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you’re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021."
156,CHAIR POWELL,You’re also seeing tighter monetary policy.
157,CHAIR POWELL,And you should see some slowing.
158,CHAIR POWELL,We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that—so that the supply side can catch up.
159,CHAIR POWELL,"We also think that there will be, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions."
160,CHAIR POWELL,And those are things that we expect.
161,CHAIR POWELL,And we think that they’re probably necessary if we were to have—to get inflation—if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy."
166,CHAIR POWELL,And nothing works in the economy without price stability.
167,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.
168,CHAIR POWELL,"We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low."
169,CHAIR POWELL,"We want to get back to that, but that’s not happening."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do."
172,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate."
173,CHAIR POWELL,We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.
179,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not—we’re not trying to have a recession.
180,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t think we have to.
181,CHAIR POWELL,"We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions."
182,CHAIR POWELL,"So that is—that’s what we’re trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there’s a path to that."
183,CHAIR POWELL,"We know that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control."
184,CHAIR POWELL,And it may narrow further.
185,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"There, there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"Without restoring price stability, you won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this."
190,CHAIR POWELL,We’re trying not to make a mistake.
191,CHAIR POWELL,Let me put it this way: We do see that there are two-sided risks.
192,CHAIR POWELL,"There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost."
193,CHAIR POWELL,"If July 27, 2022 you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later to the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives."
194,CHAIR POWELL,They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.
195,CHAIR POWELL,"When that starts to really happen, and we don’t think that’s happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder."
196,CHAIR POWELL,And the pain will be that much greater.
197,CHAIR POWELL,So I really do think that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.
204,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t—I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason is, there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are performing, you know, too well."
206,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, it’s true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5½ percent."
209,CHAIR POWELL,We would have expected growth to slow.
210,CHAIR POWELL,There’s also more slowing going on now.
211,CHAIR POWELL,"But if you look at the labor market, you’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month."
212,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s a remarkably strong level for, for this state of, of affairs."
213,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent.
214,CHAIR POWELL,All of the wage measures that we track are running very strong.
215,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is a very strong labor market, and it’s just not consistent with—you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"It doesn’t make sense that the July 27, 2022 economy would be in recession with, with this kind of thing happening."
217,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t think the U.S.
218,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economy’s in recession right now.
220,CHAIR POWELL,"Ah, haven’t seen it, and, and we’ll just have to see what it says."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t—I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly."
222,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just—it’s just that it’s very hard—it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of] U.S. GDP.
223,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a large economy.
224,CHAIR POWELL,And a lot of—a lot of work and judgment goes into that.
225,CHAIR POWELL,"But you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a—with a grain of salt."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"But, of course, it’s something we’ll be looking at."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"So those are—those are the toughest rules in place, you know, at any comparable institution that I’m aware of."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"We think—you know, we’ve thought about this carefully, and we put them in place."
235,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you know, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually, you won’t be able to make trades unless they’re precleared."
236,CHAIR POWELL,"And the amount of trades you make, they’ll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just—I think we’ve really, you know, created a very strong and robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, we’re just now—the system is just now up and running."
239,CHAIR POWELL,And I’m proud of what we did.
248,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation."
250,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be.
251,CHAIR POWELL,"And I also mentioned that, as this process—now that we’re at neutral—as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve been front-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be."
254,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
255,CHAIR POWELL,"And in terms of September, we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do."
256,CHAIR POWELL,And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.
257,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase."
258,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not a decision that we’ve made at all.
259,CHAIR POWELL,"So we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data."
260,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think you can still think of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry, the June SEP, because July 27, 2022 it’s only six weeks old."
261,CHAIR POWELL,"And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"I think in this Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL one—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year."
263,CHAIR POWELL,So I would point you to that.
271,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s an interesting, interesting situation."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ve, we’ve long used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives."
273,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that that view is pretty widely understood.
274,CHAIR POWELL,"That said, the public really reads about CPI."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does."
276,CHAIR POWELL,And so that accounts for a lot of the difference.
277,CHAIR POWELL,"However, over time, they tend to come together."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we—given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"But remember, we do target PCE."
280,CHAIR POWELL,That is because we think it’s a better measure.
281,CHAIR POWELL,They will come together eventually.
282,CHAIR POWELL,The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"And if it went—if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"And now it’s—now it’s much larger than that because of the things I July 27, 2022 mentioned."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ll be watching both, but, again, the one that we think is the best measure Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL always has been PCE, at least since I think we—some 20 plus years ago—moved to PCE."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter—consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, you know, people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not, not true of the second quarter."
301,CHAIR POWELL,"But at the same time, you have this labor market."
302,CHAIR POWELL,So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong.
303,CHAIR POWELL,And the economy has gone right through that and been fine.
304,CHAIR POWELL,So that—that’s happened many times.
305,CHAIR POWELL,"And it used to happen—if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just July 27, 2022 fine."
306,CHAIR POWELL,And it turned out to just be measurement error.
307,CHAIR POWELL,It was called residual seasonality.
308,CHAIR POWELL,We Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL don’t know the situation.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating."
310,CHAIR POWELL,We do.
312,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not sure.
313,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to have to watch the data carefully.
314,CHAIR POWELL,There are—there is a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend.
315,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate is very low.
316,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market’s very hot.
317,CHAIR POWELL,"There are many, many job openings."
318,CHAIR POWELL,Wages are high.
319,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be, be doing pretty well in the second half of the year."
320,CHAIR POWELL,But we’ll have to see.
321,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad.
322,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be watching that.
323,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll be watching that.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen, in the labor market, what you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation—still, still quite robust, as I mentioned."
331,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re seeing that.
332,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments."
333,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not sure that that’s actually real.
334,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s some evidence that wages—if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess."
336,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.
337,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year."
338,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance.
339,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at—if you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down."
340,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment.
341,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think most—also, if you look at—I mean, once you start citing these things, you can’t stop."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months."
343,CHAIR POWELL,So that might be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the establishment survey.
344,CHAIR POWELL,"So executive summary [is]: I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much."
345,CHAIR POWELL,We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn’t moved up since January.
346,CHAIR POWELL,That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID.
347,CHAIR POWELL,And there’s evidence that that’s the case.
348,CHAIR POWELL,But—So we’re not seeing much in the way of labor supply.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well."
352,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down."
353,CHAIR POWELL,"We need to be July 27, 2022 confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels."
354,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL something we can avoid doing.
355,CHAIR POWELL,That really needs to happen.
356,CHAIR POWELL,"And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience."
358,CHAIR POWELL,And that suggests that this time could be different.
365,CHAIR POWELL,"So as, as I mentioned, it doesn’t seem that the U.S. economy is in recession right now."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let’s put it that way—in growth."
367,CHAIR POWELL,And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned.
368,CHAIR POWELL,"But there’s also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"So, overall, you would say that, in all probability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year."
370,CHAIR POWELL,But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re—you know, we’re going to be watching that carefully."
372,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, what was the— EDWARD LAWRENCE."
373,CHAIR POWELL,Forecasts.
375,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, you know, we’ve said since the beginning, I think, that, that having a soft landing is what we’re aiming for."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, that has to be our goal."
377,CHAIR POWELL,It is our goal.
378,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll keep trying to achieve it.
379,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—I do think events—at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy."
380,CHAIR POWELL,It was going to be quite challenging to do that.
381,CHAIR POWELL,It’s unusual.
382,CHAIR POWELL,It’s an unusual event.
383,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not a typical event, given where we are."
384,CHAIR POWELL,"If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor market actually is—has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see—you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn’t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"And, but we don’t know that."
386,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, this is a—this is a case of first impression."
387,CHAIR POWELL,So anyone who is really sure that it’s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty.
388,CHAIR POWELL,"And so I would certainly say it’s an uncertain, uncertain thing."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, it’s our goal to achieve it, and we’ll keep trying to do that."
397,CHAIR POWELL,So we think it’s working fine.
398,CHAIR POWELL,"As you know, we, we tapered up into it."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength."
400,CHAIR POWELL,And the markets seem to have accepted it.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this."
402,CHAIR POWELL,And we expect that’ll be the case.
403,CHAIR POWELL,"July 27, 2022 So I would say the plan is broadly on track."
404,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL these trades don’t settle until—for a bit of time.
405,CHAIR POWELL,But it’ll be picking up steam.
406,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while.
407,CHAIR POWELL,"And that time, it’s hard to be precise, but, you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing."
408,CHAIR POWELL,And this is a much faster pace than the last time.
409,CHAIR POWELL,"Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"But we looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace."
411,CHAIR POWELL,And we have no reason to think it’s not.
417,CHAIR POWELL,"So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
419,CHAIR POWELL,"So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, the way this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy."
422,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t control that second step.
423,CHAIR POWELL,We’re just going to do what we think needs to be done.
424,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that July 27, 2022 inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent."
425,CHAIR POWELL,Confident.
426,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re going to take Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL it.
427,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"So, yes, we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at the new framework that we’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “It’s not credible."
438,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that."
440,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn’t part of the framework.
441,CHAIR POWELL,The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.
442,CHAIR POWELL,It was just guidance that we put in place.
443,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say two things.
444,CHAIR POWELL,"One, I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation."
445,CHAIR POWELL,"But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again."
446,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think I would do that again.
447,CHAIR POWELL,"We—you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly July 27, 2022 unexpected way for all of us."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL flexibility than that."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did."
451,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn’t matter."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s happening now—admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway."
464,CHAIR POWELL,So there was the famous one in 2013.
465,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting, where, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply."
466,CHAIR POWELL,So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that.
467,CHAIR POWELL,It was just like that’s how we did it.
468,CHAIR POWELL,And so we did it that way this time.
469,CHAIR POWELL,"We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing."
470,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive."
471,CHAIR POWELL,They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter.
472,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, when it happens, you have to—really, in both ’13 and ’18, it really had consequences for the real July 27, 2022 economy, you know, two, three, four months later."
473,CHAIR POWELL,So we were trying to avoid that.
474,CHAIR POWELL,That was Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL part of it.
475,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I don’t think that’s—the real issue of 2020 and ’21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy."
476,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that was where the big uncertainty was."
477,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better: that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up."
478,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case: these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly.
479,CHAIR POWELL,And they just haven’t.
480,CHAIR POWELL,They still haven’t.
481,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be."
482,CHAIR POWELL,"We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time."
483,CHAIR POWELL,"And so that’s really, you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did."
484,CHAIR POWELL,"When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then."
485,CHAIR POWELL,I think people would agree.
486,CHAIR POWELL,"But before then, inflation was coming down month by month."
487,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story—probably had the story right."
488,CHAIR POWELL,"But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said “No."
489,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.” And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are."
496,CHAIR POWELL,So the Fed doesn’t make a—doesn’t make a judgment on that.
497,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
498,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t—we don’t say “There is now a recession” and that kind of thing.
499,CHAIR POWELL,So that wouldn’t be something we’d do.
500,CHAIR POWELL,"We would look at the data tomorrow—and no doubt, we’ll look at it very carefully—and draw whatever implications we can."
501,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation—sorry, what a recession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained for more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it."
502,CHAIR POWELL,And it just doesn’t—this just doesn’t seem like that now.
503,CHAIR POWELL,What we have right now doesn’t seem like that.
504,CHAIR POWELL,And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data.
505,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, that’s not a decision that we—that we make."
506,CHAIR POWELL,And we won’t—we won’t reach a conclusion one way or another on that.
514,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before."
515,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and July 27, 2022 the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that."
516,CHAIR POWELL,So it could be higher.
517,CHAIR POWELL,And my Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.
518,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, I would add that we don’t know it."
519,CHAIR POWELL,We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence.
520,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say it must have moved up materially.
521,CHAIR POWELL,"But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly."
522,CHAIR POWELL,"And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market."
523,CHAIR POWELL,So if you were to—you wouldn’t observe this.
524,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen."
525,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t—we don’t control that.
526,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down."
534,CHAIR POWELL,"No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the U.S. economy’s in a recession now."
535,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ve explained why that is the case.
536,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s because you do see a very strong labor market."
537,CHAIR POWELL,And I think the public will see that as well.
538,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, going forward, what we’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned."
539,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the—in the tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings."
540,CHAIR POWELL,"So, and I mentioned that, that—I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn’t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment."
541,CHAIR POWELL,We’re trying to achieve that.
542,CHAIR POWELL,"I have said, on many occasions, that we understand that’s going to be quite challenging and that it’s got more challenging over recent months."
548,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly—for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so."
549,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the appropriate thing to do.
550,CHAIR POWELL,"And this year, it clearly is."
551,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say that, given how quickly we’ve moved, I’m gratified that while—that, basically, markets have been working."
552,CHAIR POWELL,They’ve been orderly.
553,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected."
554,CHAIR POWELL,"For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some—in some sense lowers vulnerabilities."
555,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s when they’re really high that you would worry that they’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually."
556,CHAIR POWELL,Many asset values have come down.
557,CHAIR POWELL,I think you’ve got a well-capitalized banking system.
558,CHAIR POWELL,I think you have—households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that’s on people’s balance sheets.
559,CHAIR POWELL,"So you have a pretty—from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture."
560,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the level of financial stability concerns."
561,CHAIR POWELL,"By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things."
562,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t, aren’t suffering, because they are."
563,CHAIR POWELL,They’re suffering from high inflation.
564,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying."
565,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption."
566,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it’s very concerning."
567,CHAIR POWELL,It’s very unfortunate.
568,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.
575,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that we know that inflation is too high."
576,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food and gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that."
577,CHAIR POWELL,"We do understand that, that those people suffer the most."
578,CHAIR POWELL,"Middle-class and better-off people have some resources, where they can absorb these things."
579,CHAIR POWELL,"But people, many people, don’t have those resources."
580,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we—it is our job."
581,CHAIR POWELL,It is our institutional role.
582,CHAIR POWELL,"We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people."
583,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to use our tools to do that.
584,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions."
585,CHAIR POWELL,We need growth to slow to below potential growth.
586,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t want to—we don’t want this to be bigger than it needs to be.
587,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work."
588,CHAIR POWELL,It’s what can—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren’t being eaten up by high inflation.
589,CHAIR POWELL,"If you talk to people—again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—they’re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation."
590,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s all the more reason why we need to move, move on this."
591,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
