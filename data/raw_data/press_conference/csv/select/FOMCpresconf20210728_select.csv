0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.
3,CHAIR POWELL,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
4,CHAIR POWELL,Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
6,CHAIR POWELL,Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
7,CHAIR POWELL,The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered.
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the July 28, 2021 leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, the labor market has Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL a ways to go."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that July 28, 2021 inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Our new framework for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
27,CHAIR POWELL,Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
28,CHAIR POWELL,"If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy."
29,CHAIR POWELL,"The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain."
30,CHAIR POWELL,Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the Delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas."
32,CHAIR POWELL,Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions.
33,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
35,CHAIR POWELL,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions July 28, 2021 have reached level—levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
38,CHAIR POWELL,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
39,CHAIR POWELL,They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
40,CHAIR POWELL,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our—toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a change."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of “substantial further progress.” In coming meetings, the Committee will again assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on the incoming data."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"As we’ve said, we will provide advance notice before making any changes to our purchases."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities."
45,CHAIR POWELL,These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.
46,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
47,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
48,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
49,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
50,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
57,CHAIR POWELL,Great.
58,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
59,CHAIR POWELL,So more detail on substantial further progress.
60,CHAIR POWELL,So let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that.
61,CHAIR POWELL,"As you know, with maximum employment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"That the—we monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such."
64,CHAIR POWELL,There’s participation.
65,CHAIR POWELL,There’s wages.
66,CHAIR POWELL,There’s all kinds of flow data.
67,CHAIR POWELL,And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment.
68,CHAIR POWELL,"So there isn’t—I can’t give you a, a, a set of numbers—for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was."
69,CHAIR POWELL,We didn’t do that here.
70,CHAIR POWELL,What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals.
71,CHAIR POWELL,"And what we said was, we would keep, July 28, 2021 effectively, we’d—we would give advance warning as we—and, and, you know, more and more Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL clarity—as, as we move forward."
72,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what we’re going to try to do.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"I’d say we have some ground to cover on, on the labor market side."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’re, we’re some way away from, from having had substantial further progress with, with max—toward the maximum-employment goal."
76,CHAIR POWELL,I would want to see some strong job numbers.
77,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and that’s, that’s kind of the idea."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective."
82,CHAIR POWELL,The question whether we’ve met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make.
83,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t—I can’t do that by myself.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and, again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, yes."
94,CHAIR POWELL,We can hear you.
99,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as you know, we’re, we’re in a process now where what we said is that as—at this meeting and in coming meetings, we’re going to be continuing to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals and give advance notice."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be—try to provide additional clarity about our thinking, both in the—in the postmeeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can."
102,CHAIR POWELL,We have not reached substantial further progress yet.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as having some—we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there."
104,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what I would say.
105,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of—in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I’ll say a couple things."
106,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, it will have significant health consequences for many."
107,CHAIR POWELL,And we need to keep that in mind before we start—before we mention and move to the economic questions.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a—rising cases in, in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite significantly."
109,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll see.
110,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’ve seen, though, is with successive waves of, of COVID over the past year and some months now, there has tended to be less economic—less in the way of economic implications from each wave."
111,CHAIR POWELL,And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.
112,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s, you know, it’s a—it’s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"So it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of the risk of infection."
114,CHAIR POWELL,"Dining out, traveling, schools might—some schools might not reopen."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"We may just—we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on, on the return to July 28, 2021 the labor market."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"Some people might choose—again, we, we don’t have a strong sense of how Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that might work out, so we’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time."
126,CHAIR POWELL,It really isn’t relevant now.
127,CHAIR POWELL,"It—because we’re really—we’re looking at, at tapering asset purchases."
128,CHAIR POWELL,We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.
129,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not something that, that is on our radar screen right now."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that’s when we’ll ask that question."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"That is when that, that will become a real question for us."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"Jeanna, I’m sorry."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"For the first 15 seconds of your question, you froze."
143,CHAIR POWELL,I apologize.
150,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
151,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s an—it’s an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is.
152,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in many cases, that’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to, to vaccines."
153,CHAIR POWELL,"And so they’re seeing significant outbreaks, and it’s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular—are having a very strong rebound."
154,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well."
155,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a feature of our economy.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"In, in a couple of ways, potentially."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"One just is that, in general, economies—and through financial markets and through trade—are, are deeply interconnected now."
159,CHAIR POWELL,And so a stronger global economy will lead to more U.S. exports.
160,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and, you know, that’ll help economic activity."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports."
162,CHAIR POWELL,That’s one way.
163,CHAIR POWELL,"Another way, though, is more on the risk side."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’s July 28, 2021 really finally safe."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"These, these strains—there’s no reason they just can’t keep coming and one, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL you know, one more powerful than the next."
166,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know that.
167,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s, that’s, that’s certainly a plausible outcome."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity."
169,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, it, it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason."
179,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
180,CHAIR POWELL,I’d be glad to.
181,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected."
182,CHAIR POWELL,But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories.
183,CHAIR POWELL,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.
184,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s new, used, and rental cars."
185,CHAIR POWELL,It’s airplane tickets.
186,CHAIR POWELL,It’s hotels.
187,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s a couple of other things.
188,CHAIR POWELL,And each of those has a story attached to it that is—that is really about the reopening of the economy.
189,CHAIR POWELL,"So we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply side will respond."
190,CHAIR POWELL,The economy will adapt.
191,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market."
192,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s a real—a real asset that we have.
193,CHAIR POWELL,And so we think that inflation should move down over time.
194,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, we don’t have any—much confidence, let’s say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term."
195,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, in the near term, that July 28, 2021 the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside."
196,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I, I have some confidence in the—in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the medium term, that inflation will move back down."
197,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, it’s hard to say when that will be."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate."
199,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is half of our mandate.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"So we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"We think that, that some of it will, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through."
203,CHAIR POWELL,And it could take some time.
204,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so in terms of what’s been happening in bond markets, I don’t think there’s a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting."
212,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen the long-term yields go down significantly.
213,CHAIR POWELL,"Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"And there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can’t quite explain."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the July 28, 2021 credibility of our framework, if, if that’s really your question."
217,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to achieving Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent average inflation over time.
218,CHAIR POWELL,"What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"But we have high inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case."
223,CHAIR POWELL,And we have to—we have to deal with that.
224,CHAIR POWELL,"Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re monitoring that very carefully, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, I think our—I think our framework is pretty well understood."
227,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues."
236,CHAIR POWELL,"So there’s a—there’s a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I’m sure—I’m sure you’re familiar with, which, which talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"Most of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have high employment—they, they tend to go together."
238,CHAIR POWELL,This is a situation where they’re temporarily in different directions.
239,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation."
240,CHAIR POWELL,"We feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the next—over the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment."
241,CHAIR POWELL,This is a very strong labor market.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that’s, that’s the path that we’re on, and, and it shouldn’t take that long in macroeconomic time to get there."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s what I think is, is really the likely case."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, it’s not—it’s not timely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’re doing is, we’re, we’re looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we—how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering after that."
247,CHAIR POWELL,"The question you asked about, would we raise rates if we hadn’t finished cutting—hadn’t finished the taper, hypothetical question."
248,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’d, we’d face the circumstance at the time."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"We could always just—you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s, it’s, it’s just hard to—it’s hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"Ideally, you wouldn’t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you’re adding July 28, 2021 accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates."
252,CHAIR POWELL,So that wouldn’t Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL be ideal.
253,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll say that.
266,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a—it’s a really unusual situation to have—to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high.
267,CHAIR POWELL,And we think there are a number of things at work there.
268,CHAIR POWELL,"Maybe the place to start is, is just to say that this is now not so much about people going back to their old jobs."
269,CHAIR POWELL,It’s about finding a new job.
270,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a time-intensive, labor-intensive process."
271,CHAIR POWELL,And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"There, there’s research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that."
273,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they’re just going back to their old job.
274,CHAIR POWELL,"This is about job selection, things like that."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"There may also be some factors that are—that are holding people back, and that’s—this is what surveys say."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"There are people who, who are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"These could be jobs where, where there was a lot of, of interaction with the public and where perhaps there’s a family member who’s vulnerable or for whatever reason."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s also caretakers who are—where, where schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of, of, of older people."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"And there’s also been very generous July 28, 2021 unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off."
280,CHAIR POWELL,They’ll be—they’ll be fully rolled off in a Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL couple of months.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"And all of those factors should, should wane."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we, we think we should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, ultimately, it’s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that many unemployed people."
284,CHAIR POWELL,That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market.
285,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it’s very hard to hire people."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"And that may be because people, people are shopping carefully for their next job."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I, I, I think the bottom line on this is, people want to work."
288,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire."
289,CHAIR POWELL,Some people will retire.
290,CHAIR POWELL,"But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they’ll find their way into the jobs that they want."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"It may take some time, though."
302,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better July 28, 2021 than anyone expected."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we, we were coming off the spring wave, where there were a Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL lot of shutdowns."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was much less than, than people thought."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"People—what’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated."
308,CHAIR POWELL,They’re going on with their lives.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"Secondly, we’ve kind of learned to live with it."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"A lot of industries have, have kind of improvised their way around it—particularly, for example, buying a new home."
311,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"And so they were able to, you know, to, to do that."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"And other industries as well have gone to take-out and, you know, no-contact things."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—so that can all—it seems like we’ve learned to, to handle this."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I, I hope to some extent, we will over time."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact."
318,CHAIR POWELL,"A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived."
319,CHAIR POWELL,"So with Delta, we’re just going to have to watch."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, with, with, with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective—we’re not experts on this—but it, it seems like the—a good—a good going-in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less."
321,CHAIR POWELL,There probably won’t be significant lockdowns and things like that.
322,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or—nor is it something we’re be—we’d be expert in."
323,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the, the, the channels, you know, I—this is—this is kind of speculation, but it’s pretty—it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the—for the—for the Delta wave to go."
324,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m not saying this’ll happen, but that it’s easy to imagine that."
326,CHAIR POWELL,I’m just going to—I’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work.
327,CHAIR POWELL,Wouldn’t be hard to imagine that happening.
328,CHAIR POWELL,"If, if schools don’t open, then caretakers have to stay home."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"And if people don’t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t—it doesn’t—it doesn’t—again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future—it doesn’t seem as though the effects will be very large."
331,CHAIR POWELL,But there may be effects.
332,CHAIR POWELL,And they—it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months—or not.
333,CHAIR POWELL,"There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we’re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are."
345,CHAIR POWELL,The concept of “transitory” is really this: It is that the increases will happen.
346,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not saying they will reverse.
347,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not what “transitory” means.
348,CHAIR POWELL,"It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year."
349,CHAIR POWELL,That’s inflation.
350,CHAIR POWELL,"When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an example; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have an inflation process."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward."
352,CHAIR POWELL,"So what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process."
353,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, we don’t mean—I don’t mean that, that, that, that, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back."
354,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s not the idea."
355,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just that they won’t go on indefinitely.
357,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going."
358,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up."
359,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t July 28, 2021 think that’s happening."
360,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no evidence that it’s happening.
361,CHAIR POWELL,All the evidence is that it’s not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL happening.
362,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is—you know, we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time."
364,CHAIR POWELL,And so we’ve got to be very careful about that.
365,CHAIR POWELL,"But, but I, I, I think it’s a good point that it’s, it’s a term—what it really means is temporary."
366,CHAIR POWELL,But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases will be taken back.
367,CHAIR POWELL,"Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of—so we’re, we’re working virtually here, and we’ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that."
370,CHAIR POWELL,We really haven’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’ll depend on, to some extent, on what—on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not—if I—if I said we’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I’m not meaning to suggest July 28, 2021 anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL decision."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"All I’m saying is, is, we’re not at substantial further progress."
381,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a range of views on, on what timing will be appropriate."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"And those views ultimately track, track back to people’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards, towards our—towards our goal."
383,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s really what it is."
384,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we’re going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"But, today, I’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition."
386,CHAIR POWELL,And it was a good meeting.
387,CHAIR POWELL,"And—but no decisions are made, and, and I’m just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing."
388,CHAIR POWELL,I—but I will say we’re making progress.
389,CHAIR POWELL,We expect further progress.
390,CHAIR POWELL,"And we expect that, if, if things go well, then we will—we will reach that goal."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we’ll taper at that point."
392,CHAIR POWELL,"I can’t, I really—there’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole."
393,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I’m in—we’re in the process of writing that speech."
394,CHAIR POWELL,"And I am going to give a speech, and—but I, I, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to say what will be in there at this point."
400,CHAIR POWELL,We—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"They, they really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which—on which, which are very, very important to our economy and the global economy."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand."
403,CHAIR POWELL,They were strongly needed.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now."
405,CHAIR POWELL,So we said we would taper when we—when we achieve substantial further progress.
406,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and, you know, we’re going to honor that commitment."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s—and, and, again, we’re talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction."
408,CHAIR POWELL,We will taper when we reach that goal.
409,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll provide more, you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is appropriate."
416,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks."
417,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we’ve seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most—mostly, or to, to the greatest extent, to July 28, 2021 people at the lower end of the income spectrum."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look back at not this previous—not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL this crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized."
419,CHAIR POWELL,"So higher capital requirements are, are, you know, are, are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it’s other tools that we have to—and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools, other agencies have some of these tools—to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low- and moderate-income communities."
421,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s CRA.
422,CHAIR POWELL,We enforce CRA.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re working on a—on a new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it’s going to be—it’s going to be good and will support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income households."
424,CHAIR POWELL,It’s also the anti—anti–lending discrimination statutes that we enforce.
425,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income communities.
426,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I don’t think it’s capital standards at all."
427,CHAIR POWELL,I think capital standards work the other way.
428,CHAIR POWELL,"Strong capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income communities."
437,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
438,CHAIR POWELL,"So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we’re seeing upward, upward pressure on prices."
440,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not really what we’re seeing.
441,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’re seeing is a handful of things that are really—that really account for the, the overshoot of inflation."
442,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, it’s things like cars."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, new, used, and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage."
444,CHAIR POWELL,"And housing—sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before."
445,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high."
446,CHAIR POWELL,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy."
447,CHAIR POWELL,"So what I said was, we, we’re going to see whether these things—we don’t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down."
449,CHAIR POWELL,So what we want to see is these other things.
452,CHAIR POWELL,"If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they’re not contributing to inflation."
453,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the—among the things that have really moved up quickly, then we’ll, we’ll—they won’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we’ll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"And I don’t think it will take, or what I said was, I don’t think it’ll take a very long time to see whether that’s the case."
455,CHAIR POWELL,"It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the, the overall July 28, 2021 reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a historic, world Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL historical event, that the global economy is now reopening."
457,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not going to—it’s not going to happen quickly.
458,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going to take some time.
459,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before."
460,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think we will—we will know, you know, when we know."
461,CHAIR POWELL,But I don’t think it will take that long.
462,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t want to put a number on it.
463,CHAIR POWELL,"But I do think that, that, if we see those things happening, we’ll know that we have the story basically right."
472,CHAIR POWELL,"So a number of participants raised that—the questions around MBS and tapering at, at today’s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday’s meeting."
473,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’ll just say that, generally speaking, I don’t think and—I don’t think that—I think that Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways."
474,CHAIR POWELL,"There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big."
475,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not—it’s—so where I think we are is, there, there really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries."
476,CHAIR POWELL,I think we will taper them at the same time.
477,CHAIR POWELL,"It seems likely, based on where people are now."
478,CHAIR POWELL,"The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat July 28, 2021 faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people—others, not so much."
479,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And I think it’s something that we’ll be continuing to discuss.
487,CHAIR POWELL,"So it, it really is a backstop."
488,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy."
489,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness."
490,CHAIR POWELL,That’s the purpose of it.
491,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s set up with that purpose in mind.
492,CHAIR POWELL,"Your question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range."
493,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s essentially, essentially, what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances."
494,CHAIR POWELL,"So that, that’s all that’s really happening there."
495,CHAIR POWELL,And we expect it to be high for some time.
496,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and, July 28, 2021 and also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that."
497,CHAIR POWELL,"So we don’t— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL we don’t have a problem with, with what it’s doing."
498,CHAIR POWELL,It’s kind of doing the job we expected.
501,CHAIR POWELL,"Not, not really."
502,CHAIR POWELL,Not at this point.
503,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, money markets, private money market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as, as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and, and you’ll see it shrink back down."
515,CHAIR POWELL,"I certainly don’t, don’t have that in mind."
516,CHAIR POWELL,No.
517,CHAIR POWELL,"Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time."
518,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent."
519,CHAIR POWELL,We feel like they may be a little bit below that.
520,CHAIR POWELL,"So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing."
521,CHAIR POWELL,This is a different thing.
522,CHAIR POWELL,This is—this is not that.
523,CHAIR POWELL,"That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming July 28, 2021 economy maybe."
524,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that was the kind of inflation—this, this is something different."
525,CHAIR POWELL,"This is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL really driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand that we’re seeing."
526,CHAIR POWELL,"As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it just can’t keep up."
527,CHAIR POWELL,"And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing."
528,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, there’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic."
529,CHAIR POWELL,"I just—I’ve explained, I think, several times here today that the best—my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass."
530,CHAIR POWELL,It’s really a shock to the economy that will pass through.
531,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, if you—if you look at where forecasters are—people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very, very strongly they see it that way."
532,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might require a response."
533,CHAIR POWELL,"We, again, we don’t see that now."
534,CHAIR POWELL,"But we, we have to be on the alert for it."
535,CHAIR POWELL,"And people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to."
536,CHAIR POWELL,And we will.
537,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, it’s not—it’s not my base case."
538,CHAIR POWELL,"My base case is that—is, as I’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down."
539,CHAIR POWELL,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing."
540,CHAIR POWELL,This is not moderately above 2 percent.
541,CHAIR POWELL,This is well above 2 percent.
542,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.
543,CHAIR POWELL,This is really driven by a supply-side shock.
553,CHAIR POWELL,So wages have moved up.
554,CHAIR POWELL,A lot of that is driven by new hires.
555,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.
556,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s not troubling.
557,CHAIR POWELL,"And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now."
558,CHAIR POWELL,"And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices."
559,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, when it happens gradually, when that—if you—we’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and put some pressure on margins."
560,CHAIR POWELL,"In a long expansion, that’s been happening late in the expansion."
561,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s not a problem, either."
562,CHAIR POWELL,The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.
563,CHAIR POWELL,It was called the “wage–price spiral.” We don’t see that now.
564,CHAIR POWELL,"This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now."
565,CHAIR POWELL,And we don’t see that now.
566,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we’ll be watching it."
567,CHAIR POWELL,And this is one of the reasons why we’re watching so carefully to see whether labor force—whether people do come back and accept jobs.
568,CHAIR POWELL,"Given the very large number of job openings and the very large number of unemployed people, we’d like to see, you know, those— July 28, 2021 some matching going on there so people get back to work."
569,CHAIR POWELL,We think labor supply would be— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL would be a healthy thing.
570,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing."
