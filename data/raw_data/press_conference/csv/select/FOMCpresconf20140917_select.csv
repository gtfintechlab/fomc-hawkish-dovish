0,CHAIR YELLEN,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its meeting earlier today and, as usual, released its monetary policy statement."
2,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee also released a document describing the approach the Committee intends to take when, at some point in the future, it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy."
3,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me underscore that our release of this information is not meant to convey any change in the stance of policy.
4,CHAIR YELLEN,"As you know, the FOMC’s views on policy are conveyed in the policy statement, which I will now discuss before coming back to our normalization plans."
5,CHAIR YELLEN,"As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC decided to make another reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
6,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.
7,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me discuss the economic conditions that underpin these actions.
8,CHAIR YELLEN,The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.
9,CHAIR YELLEN,"In the labor market, conditions have improved further in recent months."
10,CHAIR YELLEN,"Although the pace of job growth has slowed some recently, job gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month over the past three months."
11,CHAIR YELLEN,"The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at the time of the June FOMC meeting."
12,CHAIR YELLEN,"Broader measures of labor market utilization, such as the U-6 measure, have shown similar improvement, and the labor force participation rate has flattened out."
13,CHAIR YELLEN,These developments continue the trend of gradual progress toward our employment objective.
14,CHAIR YELLEN,But the labor market has yet to fully recover.
15,CHAIR YELLEN,"There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them, too many who are working part time but would prefer full-time work, and too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market were stronger."
16,CHAIR YELLEN,"As noted in the September 17, 2014 FOMC statement, “a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL underutilization of labor resources.” The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market."
17,CHAIR YELLEN,"Although real GDP rose at an annual rate of only about 1 percent in the first half of the year, that modest gain reflected, in part, transitory factors, including a dip in net exports."
18,CHAIR YELLEN,"Indeed, private domestic final demand—that is, spending by domestic households and businesses—grew about twice as fast as GDP."
19,CHAIR YELLEN,"Indicators of spending and production for the third quarter suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward."
20,CHAIR YELLEN,"Inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, but with longer-term inflation expectations appearing to be well anchored and the economic recovery continuing, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective."
21,CHAIR YELLEN,"Moreover, inflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Committee believes that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished."
22,CHAIR YELLEN,"As is always the case, the Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
23,CHAIR YELLEN,"This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the FOMC participants, which, for the first time, go through 2017."
24,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
25,CHAIR YELLEN,The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the June projections and now stands at 5.9 to 6.0 percent at the end of this year.
26,CHAIR YELLEN,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level over the course of 2016 and edging a bit below that level in 2017.
27,CHAIR YELLEN,"The central tendency of September 17, 2014 the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL projections."
28,CHAIR YELLEN,"Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth."
29,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent."
30,CHAIR YELLEN,"The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
31,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I noted earlier, the Committee decided today to make another reduction in the pace of asset purchases."
32,CHAIR YELLEN,"Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired without additional policy accommodation."
33,CHAIR YELLEN,The intent of the program was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.
34,CHAIR YELLEN,"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the program, and with the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset purchases again at this meeting."
35,CHAIR YELLEN,"Starting next month, we will be purchasing $15 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate."
36,CHAIR YELLEN,"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in the labor market and inflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting."
37,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from holdings of agency debt and MBS.
38,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial September 17, 2014 conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL inflation of 2 percent."
39,CHAIR YELLEN,"Regarding interest rates, the Committee reaffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
40,CHAIR YELLEN,"Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
41,CHAIR YELLEN,This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections.
42,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I will explain in a moment, the FOMC now anticipates that it will continue to establish a target range, rather than a single point, for the federal funds rate when normalization begins, and the dots in the chart I’ve distributed now show, for each participant, the midpoint of this target range."
43,CHAIR YELLEN,"Notably, although the central tendency of the unemployment rate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a percentage point below the longer-run value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants."
44,CHAIR YELLEN,"Although FOMC participants provide a number September 17, 2014 of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its longer-run normal level at that time, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are likely to continue to restrain household spending, constrain credit availability, and depress expectations for future growth in output and incomes."
45,CHAIR YELLEN,"As these factors dissipate further, most participants expect the federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017."
46,CHAIR YELLEN,"Let me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectations for the path of the federal funds rate are contingent on the economic outlook."
47,CHAIR YELLEN,"If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged."
48,CHAIR YELLEN,"Conversely, if economic performance disappoints, increases in the federal funds rate are likely to take place later and to be more gradual."
49,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” This statement is intended to provide information to the public about the eventual normalization process; it does not signal a change in the current or future stance of monetary policy.
50,CHAIR YELLEN,"As is always the case in setting policy, the FOMC will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
51,CHAIR YELLEN,"Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation using nontraditional tools of monetary policy."
52,CHAIR YELLEN,"The FOMC’s intention has always been to return to a more traditional approach, and throughout this period, the Committee has been preparing for the normalization process."
53,CHAIR YELLEN,"In June 2011, the Committee set out some broad principles and some September 17, 2014 more specific tactics for how it envisioned the normalization process to take place."
54,CHAIR YELLEN,"In June 2013, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL we noted that conditions had changed significantly in ways not anticipated in June of 2011, including the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet, and that some revision of those earlier plans was appropriate."
55,CHAIR YELLEN,"The document released today reflects our updated plans, which, readers of our minutes will know, have been under discussion for the last few FOMC meetings."
56,CHAIR YELLEN,The new approach retains many broad objectives and principles from the original but also has some new elements.
57,CHAIR YELLEN,"As was the case before the crisis, the Committee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily through actions that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates, not through active management of the balance sheet."
58,CHAIR YELLEN,The federal funds rate will serve as the key rate to communicate the stance of policy.
59,CHAIR YELLEN,"To begin normalization, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate."
60,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee expects that the effective federal funds rate may vary within the target range, and could even move outside of that range on occasion, but such movements should have no material effect on financial conditions or the broader economy."
61,CHAIR YELLEN,"The primary tool for moving the federal funds rate into the target range will be the rate of interest paid on excess reserves, or IOER."
62,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee expects that the federal funds rate will trade below the IOER rate while reserves are so plentiful, as is the case at present."
63,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee also intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, which, by transacting with a broad set of counterparties, will help ensure that the federal funds rate remains in the target range."
64,CHAIR YELLEN,I would like to emphasize that the overnight RRP facility will only be used to the extent necessary and will be phased out when no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.
65,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, the Committee will adjust the particular settings of these tools as needed, September 17, 2014 and could deploy other supplementary tools as well, to ensure that we achieve our desired stance Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL of policy."
66,CHAIR YELLEN,"Turning now to our plans regarding the Fed’s balance sheet, the Committee intends to reduce securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the System Open Market Account."
67,CHAIR YELLEN,"Regarding the timing for ceasing reinvestments, the Committee now expects this to occur after the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate."
68,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee currently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process, although limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings."
69,CHAIR YELLEN,The timing and pace of such sales would be communicated to the public in advance.
70,CHAIR YELLEN,"It’s the Committee’s intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these securities will primarily consist of Treasury securities."
71,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I stated earlier, today’s release of the Committee’s updated normalization plans is in no way intended to signal a change in the stance of monetary policy."
72,CHAIR YELLEN,"Rather, it is meant simply to provide information about how the Committee envisions the normalization process in light of the changes in economic and financial circumstances that have occurred since we put forth our original plans more than three years ago."
73,CHAIR YELLEN,"That said, conditions could change further, and we will learn about our tools during normalization."
74,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee has agreed that it is prepared to make additional adjustments to its normalization plans if warranted by economic and financial developments.
75,CHAIR YELLEN,Thank you.
76,CHAIR YELLEN,Let me stop there.
77,CHAIR YELLEN,I’ll be happy to take your questions.
88,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, of course, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today, and it discusses what the appropriate forward guidance is at every meeting."
89,CHAIR YELLEN,This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
90,CHAIR YELLEN,"In terms of what the term “considerable time” means, the Committee decided that, based on its assessment of economic conditions, that characterization remains appropriate, and it was comfortable with it."
91,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think if you look, for example, at the projections of individual participants that are revealed in the SEP—well, that’s the view of each participant, and, again, I’d emphasize, not a Committee collective view—there is relatively little change in the assessment of the outlook by participants between this meeting and the assessment in June."
92,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the outlook is little changed—a slight decline in the anticipated path of the unemployment rate and a very slight uptick in the inflation projection, but really quite minimal."
93,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, the outlook hasn’t changed that much from June, and the Committee felt comfortable with this characterization."
95,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, as I’ve said September 17, 2014 repeatedly, the decisions that the Committee makes about what is the appropriate time to begin to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL raise its target for the federal funds rate will be data dependent."
96,CHAIR YELLEN,"And in my opening comments just now, I again emphasized something I’ve said previously, which is that if the pace of progress in achieving our goals were to quicken, if it were to accelerate, it’s likely that the Committee would begin raising its target for the federal funds rate sooner than is now anticipated and might raise—might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace."
97,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the opposite is also true, if the projection were to change."
98,CHAIR YELLEN,So there is no fixed mechanical interpretation of a time period.
99,CHAIR YELLEN,I think it would not be accurate to describe the Committee’s guidance about the timing of the federal funds rate and when it will move above zero as being calendar based.
100,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee has started with a broad general statement of what determines how long it will keep the federal funds rate target at zero.
101,CHAIR YELLEN,"It has said that it will be looking at the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and inflation, and our goals for those variables, are closing."
102,CHAIR YELLEN,And then what the Committee does at each meeting is—after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the implications of its view of the data at that time.
103,CHAIR YELLEN,And that assessment really hasn’t changed over the last several meetings.
104,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective."
105,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I wouldn’t describe that as—I know “considerable time” sounds like it’s a calendar concept, but it is highly conditional, and it’s linked to the Committee’s assessment of the economy."
110,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, the growth projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower."
111,CHAIR YELLEN,"So while the projected path of the labor market—unemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on the growth outlook."
112,CHAIR YELLEN,"And the Committee assesses that the labor market is continuing to improve, and you see a small reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period."
114,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, as a guess, I would hazard—first, I would say, there is relatively little upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very slight upward change in the projection for inflation."
115,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between performance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change."
116,CHAIR YELLEN,And you see in the projections very modest reductions in the size of those gaps and modest—very small change of a slightly faster pace at which those gaps would change.
117,CHAIR YELLEN,"I would describe the change in the projections, both for the September 17, 2014 economy and the path of rates, as quite modest."
118,CHAIR YELLEN,"But the fact that they move does illustrate the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL data-dependence principle that I think is really so important for market participants to keep in mind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold."
119,CHAIR YELLEN,There is uncertainty about that.
120,CHAIR YELLEN,"And as expectations and the actual performance of the economy change, you should expect to see movements in the dots."
121,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think it’s also notable that the further you go out in the projection period, the wider the set of dots."
122,CHAIR YELLEN,"You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part, different forecasts by different members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be."
123,CHAIR YELLEN,"What you don’t see in the dot—so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty that each individual, each participant, sees around their own projection."
124,CHAIR YELLEN,So things will depend on how the economy evolves.
125,CHAIR YELLEN,"That will change over time, and there’s a good deal of uncertainty associated with it."
131,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, to my mind, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect slack in the labor market."
132,CHAIR YELLEN,"We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the aftermath of a very significant financial crisis."
133,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’ve faced headwinds in the economy recovering, so the recovery has been slow."
134,CHAIR YELLEN,"Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five years."
135,CHAIR YELLEN,But it’s nevertheless been slow relative to past recoveries that have not been associated with financial crises.
136,CHAIR YELLEN,"And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most September 17, 2014 FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent."
137,CHAIR YELLEN,Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL So there is significant underutilization of labor resources.
138,CHAIR YELLEN,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.
139,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors."
140,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so, I think there still is—and the statement says it—“significant underutilization of labor resources” and a very modest pace of wage increases that’s picked up very little, I see as essentially a reflection of that."
147,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, with respect to identifying myself, the Committee has had discussions during the years that we have been providing these forecasts of the participants to the public as to whether or not it’s desirable from the standpoint of Committee functioning to identify who’s who in these pictures."
148,CHAIR YELLEN,"And thus far, while occasionally an individual will indicate September 17, 2014 in a speech what their personal views are, we have not yet decided that it would be a desirable Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL thing for the point of view of our decisionmaking process to identify individuals."
149,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have a subcommittee on communications that’s now chaired by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be considering the SEP and whether or not some changes are appropriate."
150,CHAIR YELLEN,"But until and unless there is some change in the Committee stance on this, I don’t want to identify myself."
151,CHAIR YELLEN,"You asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable divergence between market views and the views of the Committee."
152,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’d say that there have been any number of different analyses of this topic, there are many different survey measures and interpretations of what the market thinks."
153,CHAIR YELLEN,And I don’t frankly think it’s completely clear that there is a gap.
154,CHAIR YELLEN,There are different views on whether or not such a gap exists.
155,CHAIR YELLEN,"To the extent that there is a gap, one reason for it could be that markets and participants have different views on the evolution of economic conditions."
156,CHAIR YELLEN,"For example, I think I’d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the federal funds rate, they are showing the funds rate path that they consider most likely."
157,CHAIR YELLEN,Their economic forecasts are of the conditions that they think are the most likely ones.
158,CHAIR YELLEN,You don’t see the full range of possibilities there.
159,CHAIR YELLEN,And the path for the funds rate is the path that each individual thinks is most likely.
160,CHAIR YELLEN,"Market participants, understanding that there are a range of possible outcomes, with upside and downside possibilities, are doing something slightly different, I think, when they’re determining market prices."
161,CHAIR YELLEN,"They are taking into account the possibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including—even if they’re not very likely—ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth and the appropriate path of rates will be low."
162,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of that."
163,CHAIR YELLEN,"We, you know, want to learn, we—market participants may have different views on the economy than the September 17, 2014 Committee does, and that’s something we want to try to infer and learn market views, in part Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL from information of this type."
164,CHAIR YELLEN,"What I can say is that it is important for market participants to understand what our likely response or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to communicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data, and I promise to try to do that."
172,CHAIR YELLEN,Okay.
173,CHAIR YELLEN,All good questions.
174,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, I think the Committee would—will be focused on—we intend to use the path of short-term interest rates as our key tool of policy."
175,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, of course, market participants will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when that time comes."
176,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think the Committee would like to feel that it has successfully begun the normalization process and that we’re successfully communicating with markets about how that process will be playing out over time.
177,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I think when the Committee is comfortable that that process is established, is working well, and we’re comfortable with the outlook, that they will begin the process of ceasing—or possibly tapering—but eventually ceasing reinvestments."
178,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make sure normalization is successfully under way."
179,CHAIR YELLEN,"If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by September 17, 2014 ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take—to get back to levels of reserve balances that we Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL had before the crisis—I’m not sure we will go that low, but we’ve said that we will try to shrink our balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of policy—it could take to the end of the decade to achieve those levels."
186,CHAIR YELLEN,I’m sorry.
188,CHAIR YELLEN,The first question— BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
189,CHAIR YELLEN,The first question was— CHAIR YELLEN.
190,CHAIR YELLEN,Please.
194,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the recent Brookings paper by the Fed economists clearly indicates, and I said this at Jackson Hole, that there are structural reasons, particularly demographics but not only demographics, why labor force participation should be expected to decline over time."
195,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I agree with that, and I believe that most of my colleagues would endorse that as well."
196,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, they did indicate that, in the paper, that they see some remaining cyclical shortfall."
197,CHAIR YELLEN,"By one technique that they used, they placed the estimate at ¼ percent, but by another technique that they used it could be, I believe they said, as large as 1 percent."
198,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so my own personal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly—probably within that range."
199,CHAIR YELLEN,"But nevertheless, it’s a meaningful cyclical shortfall."
200,CHAIR YELLEN,"It’s not completely—so I’m giving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment—that, you know, I see the flat—and given the underlying downward trend in labor force participation, we might interpret the flattening out of labor force participation over the last year as showing that that cyclical component has diminished somewhat."
201,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think there is something that remains, but eventually I would certainly agree with the authors, we should expect over time to see labor force participation declining."
202,CHAIR YELLEN,"And then, let’s see, the second piece was— BINYAMIN APPELBAUM."
204,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, you know, we stayed low for a very long time."
205,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have been at zero for a very long time and below the levels that some common policy rules would now be suggesting, given the level of unemployment and inflation."
206,CHAIR YELLEN,So the recovery has been very slow.
207,CHAIR YELLEN,"We’ve also been doing unconventional policies, of course, buying assets."
208,CHAIR YELLEN,"And in a general sense, I think we have been lower for longer than—if you complete that sentence—than many standard policy rules would suggest."
209,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in a sense, that is a policy that we have had."
210,CHAIR YELLEN,"And once we decide it’s appropriate to begin to normalize policy and to raise the level of our target for September 17, 2014 short-term interest rates, it would still take some time for rates to get back to levels—you can see Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL in our projection that by the end of 2017, the participants are, on average, projecting that rates will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run."
211,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, similarly, we could make a similar statement with respect to where the funds rate would stand relative to the recommendations of rules."
212,CHAIR YELLEN,So that would take some time to return to those kinds of levels.
220,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I think it’s very natural that the Committee should have a range of opinion about a decision as crucial as what is the right time to begin to normalize policy, and we do have a range of views in the Committee."
221,CHAIR YELLEN,I don’t consider two dissents to be an abnormally large number.
222,CHAIR YELLEN,Presidents Plosser and Fisher have been quite clear in all of their speeches recently in stating that they think the time has come to begin normalizing policy.
223,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial stability concerns."
224,CHAIR YELLEN,"But the Committee adopted today’s statement by an overwhelming majority, and I don’t consider the level of dissent to be surprising or very abnormal."
230,CHAIR YELLEN,"So there’s been a little bit of downgrading, I think, even this time in the longer-run normal growth rates that Committee participants have written down."
231,CHAIR YELLEN,"You are certainly right in saying that over a number of years now, there’s been a pattern of forecast errors in which either we’ve been on track with respect to unemployment or unemployment has come down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been surprising the Committee to the downside."
232,CHAIR YELLEN,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing."
233,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we have had downward revisions in the level of potential output and to some extent, at least for a time, in the projected pace of growth."
234,CHAIR YELLEN,So that tension has been there.
235,CHAIR YELLEN,There are a range of views about long-run growth.
236,CHAIR YELLEN,A lot of people are writing about this topic.
237,CHAIR YELLEN,I think the Committee’s longer-run estimates are neither at the most pessimistic end nor the most optimistic end.
239,CHAIR YELLEN,"Oh, about Europe."
240,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have discussed the outlook for Europe—the very low level of inflation that they have seen recently and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectations, in the slow pace of growth."
241,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is one of a number of risks to the global economy, and we certainly hope that they will be successful in seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global economy and the United States."
250,CHAIR YELLEN,So we are constantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about whether it’s appropriate and how to revise it.
251,CHAIR YELLEN,And we did do a major overhaul of our forward guidance in March.
252,CHAIR YELLEN,I think the Committee participants who have spoken out on this topic recently want to make sure that we have the flexibility—that the Committee has the flexibility to respond to unfolding developments.
253,CHAIR YELLEN,"They want to make sure that if progress really does turn out to be faster than we have—we would expect, that the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy."
254,CHAIR YELLEN,They do not want to be locked into something that the markets see as a calendar-based and firm commitment.
255,CHAIR YELLEN,And so they want to emphasize data dependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibility.
256,CHAIR YELLEN,But I agree with that.
257,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, as I said earlier, I think we do not have any mechanical interpretation that applies to this."
258,CHAIR YELLEN,"It, of course, gives an impression about what we think will be appropriate, but there is no mechanical interpretation."
259,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I’ve said repeatedly, and I want to say again, that if events surprise us, and we’re moving more quickly toward our objectives, and the Committee sees a need to move sooner or later depending on what the data is, that we do feel—I do feel we have the flexibility to move."
260,CHAIR YELLEN,"And it is important for markets to understand that there is uncertainty, and this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time."
268,CHAIR YELLEN,"So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think are normal longer-run levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016."
269,CHAIR YELLEN,So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels.
270,CHAIR YELLEN,"We asked participants why they hold the views that they do about appropriate policy, and there are a number of different explanations that participants give."
271,CHAIR YELLEN,"But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulting from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating—an example would be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit."
272,CHAIR YELLEN,Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.
273,CHAIR YELLEN,"September 17, 2014 Another thing that we see is that households’ expectations about their likely income paths remain Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL quite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels."
274,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s something that may be holding back consumer spending.
275,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the view would be that those forces will dissipate over time, but only very gradually."
276,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, we have had slow productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment spending."
277,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so, those are some of the things that participants mention as why it will take some time to get back."
278,CHAIR YELLEN,"So the story is, it’s not that the Fed is behind the curve in failing to return the funds rate to normal levels when the economy is recovered."
279,CHAIR YELLEN,"It is rather that, in order to achieve such a recovery in 2016 or by the end, that it’s necessary and appropriate to have a somewhat more accommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds."
286,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, Scottish voters are about to go to the polls tomorrow, and they’ve had a good debate about this topic."
287,CHAIR YELLEN,"And in light of that, I really don’t want to weigh in on this today."
293,CHAIR YELLEN,"You know, this is something the Committee is going to have to discuss when the time comes to normalize policy."
294,CHAIR YELLEN,"Looking back on the period, the run-up to the financial crisis, I don’t think, by any means, “measured pace” and the very predictable pace of 25 basis points per meeting explains why we had a financial crisis, but it may have diminished volatility and been a small contributing factor, and the Committee will have to think about how to do this."
295,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think many people in the aftermath of that episode think that somewhat less of a mechanical pace would perhaps be better, but this is a matter that we will, in due time, have to discuss."
