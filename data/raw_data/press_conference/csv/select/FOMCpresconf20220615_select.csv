0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,I will begin with one overarching message: We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so."
3,CHAIR POWELL,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
4,CHAIR POWELL,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.
5,CHAIR POWELL,It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
9,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
13,CHAIR POWELL,The tightening in financial conditions that we’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.
14,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections."
21,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9 percent."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services."
25,CHAIR POWELL,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
26,CHAIR POWELL,And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.
27,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total PCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices."
28,CHAIR POWELL,The median projection is 5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024.
29,CHAIR POWELL,Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.
30,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point increase in the target range so far this year."
35,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.
36,CHAIR POWELL,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a ½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations."
38,CHAIR POWELL,We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the target range was warranted at today’s meeting."
41,CHAIR POWELL,This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels.
42,CHAIR POWELL,And it will help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.
43,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, still above the median longer-run value."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
47,CHAIR POWELL,We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can."
51,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
52,CHAIR POWELL,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
53,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
54,CHAIR POWELL,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
55,CHAIR POWELL,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
56,CHAIR POWELL,We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
57,CHAIR POWELL,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
58,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
59,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
60,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
61,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
62,CHAIR POWELL,And I look forward to your questions.
69,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function."
70,CHAIR POWELL,"And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it’s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual—again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown that they understand the path we’re laying out."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, it remains data dependent."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"And so that’s what we generally think about guidance, and that’s why we offer it."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, when we offered that—when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"I also said that if the economy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did."
81,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s really—that’s really how we made the decision.
89,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
90,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you take a step back, what we’re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down."
91,CHAIR POWELL,And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings—that’s what we’re looking for.
92,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve said that we’d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks—the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago."
94,CHAIR POWELL,"So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside."
95,CHAIR POWELL,"Indicators—some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have moved up notably."
96,CHAIR POWELL,"So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting, and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike, as I mentioned."
97,CHAIR POWELL,"So the point of it, really, is this: We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we’ve seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent."
99,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that."
100,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.
101,CHAIR POWELL,This was really about the speed in which we would get there.
102,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75."
103,CHAIR POWELL,"That would put us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range—in that more normal range, and that’s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward."
104,CHAIR POWELL,Just talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end of this year.
105,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, so remember how highly uncertain this is."
106,CHAIR POWELL,But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½ percent.
107,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s where people are, and that’s what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it."
108,CHAIR POWELL,"If things are better, we don’t need to do that much, and if they’re not, then we either do that much or possibly even more."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"But in any case, it will be very data dependent."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"Then you’re looking at next year, and what you’re seeing is, people see more—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent."
111,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s generally what people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent.
112,CHAIR POWELL,"So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting, and that’s what we did."
121,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
123,CHAIR POWELL,And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that’s in the mid-2s."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they’re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive."
130,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not true at the short end.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you don’t have real—you have negative rates still."
132,CHAIR POWELL,So that really is one data point—it’s one part of financial conditions.
133,CHAIR POWELL,So I think—I have to look at it this way: We move the policy rate.
134,CHAIR POWELL,That affects financial conditions.
135,CHAIR POWELL,And that affects the economy.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating."
138,CHAIR POWELL,Demand is very hot still in the economy.
139,CHAIR POWELL,"We’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, there’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply, though, so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand."
141,CHAIR POWELL,Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"There are many things we can’t affect, and those would be, you know, the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation."
143,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really how I think—how I think about it.
146,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.
147,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’ll know when we get there really.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, honestly, though, that would be—you would have positive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then."
149,CHAIR POWELL,I think you’d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve.
150,CHAIR POWELL,I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.
152,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to find that out empirically.
153,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not going to be completely model driven about this.
154,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the economy."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years."
164,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s really where inflation expectations are.
165,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent."
166,CHAIR POWELL,And so this is really very important to us—that that remain the case.
167,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that’s what you see."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously."
169,CHAIR POWELL,We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously.
170,CHAIR POWELL,"So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading; it might be revised—nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take seriously.” And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations."
172,CHAIR POWELL,We’re absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent.
173,CHAIR POWELL,That was one of the reasons—the other was just the CPI reading.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think."
176,CHAIR POWELL,So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be.
177,CHAIR POWELL,"The main thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy, which is appropriate."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive."
179,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that’s how we’ll take it.
186,CHAIR POWELL,"To take your second question first, yes."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think we’re—again, we’re going, we’re resolved to take this on, but we’re going to be flexible in the implementation of it."
188,CHAIR POWELL,Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance.
189,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s always a tradeoff, because you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"I, frankly, think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work."
192,CHAIR POWELL,"With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are."
193,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening.
194,CHAIR POWELL,And I would hope that our—it’s always going to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect.
195,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation."
196,CHAIR POWELL,We want to see progress.
197,CHAIR POWELL,"We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we don’t see that, then that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react."
199,CHAIR POWELL,But we will.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"This is an unusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to—very close to our meeting."
204,CHAIR POWELL,Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times."
206,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.
212,CHAIR POWELL,The second part I didn’t get.
214,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
215,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down."
217,CHAIR POWELL,"So, soon enough, we’ll have our policy rate—let’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says: The policy rate will be up where we think it should be."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.” Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up."
222,CHAIR POWELL,So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring victory.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"But our—again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
226,CHAIR POWELL,I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not.
227,CHAIR POWELL,"And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain [developments], things like that, where we really—the monetary policy stance doesn’t affect those things."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"But having said that, there is a path for us to get there—it’s not getting easier; it’s getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand."
229,CHAIR POWELL,"Take, for example, in the labor market."
230,CHAIR POWELL,"So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
232,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s a possibility.
234,CHAIR POWELL,"So you have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it."
235,CHAIR POWELL,"So demand comes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors."
236,CHAIR POWELL,"So in principle, that could work in reverse."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side."
238,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s a pathway there.
239,CHAIR POWELL,"It is not going to be easy, and there—again, it’s our objective, but, as I mentioned, it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control."
248,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"We hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for—we’d seen it for, like, one year in the last 50."
252,CHAIR POWELL,So the idea that—3.6 percent is historically low in the last century.
253,CHAIR POWELL,So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome.
254,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate.
255,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome.
257,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of work, of course."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"We never think, “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability."
259,CHAIR POWELL,"And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market, and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic—where participation is high, where there’s lots of job opportunities, where it’s just a really—I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we want to get back to."
260,CHAIR POWELL,And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.
261,CHAIR POWELL,We’d love to get back to that place.
262,CHAIR POWELL,"But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation we have."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have to restore that, and it really is in service, in the medium and longer term, of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve."
269,CHAIR POWELL,Not trying to induce a recession now.
270,CHAIR POWELL,Let’s be clear about that.
271,CHAIR POWELL,We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.
272,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what we’re trying to do.
273,CHAIR POWELL,So let me talk about that sentence.
275,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s kind of what the SEP says.
276,CHAIR POWELL,"The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with unemployment at 4.1 percent."
277,CHAIR POWELL,And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it."
279,CHAIR POWELL,But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.
280,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market."
282,CHAIR POWELL,And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.
283,CHAIR POWELL,It just didn’t—the sentence isn’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this.
284,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s not—that just didn’t seem appropriate, so we took the sentence out."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting progress, and we didn’t get that."
288,CHAIR POWELL,We got sort of the opposite.
289,CHAIR POWELL,"So I also think the situation, really—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you’re seeing is the situation getting more difficult."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"And you look around the world—I mean, lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to commodities prices."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"And so—and we’re seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that."
293,CHAIR POWELL,That’s not something we can do something about.
294,CHAIR POWELL,"So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations."
296,CHAIR POWELL,Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation.
297,CHAIR POWELL,But headline inflation is what people experience.
298,CHAIR POWELL,They don’t know what core is.
300,CHAIR POWELL,They have no reason to.
301,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.
302,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing."
309,CHAIR POWELL,"And so I—but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong."
310,CHAIR POWELL,The consumer’s in really good shape financially.
311,CHAIR POWELL,They’re spending.
312,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy.
313,CHAIR POWELL,People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low.
314,CHAIR POWELL,That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.
315,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s what we’re seeing.
316,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not seeing a broad slowdown.
317,CHAIR POWELL,"We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at quite robust levels."
318,CHAIR POWELL,We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth levels.
320,CHAIR POWELL,"It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit."
322,CHAIR POWELL,And we watch—we’re responsible for watching everything.
323,CHAIR POWELL,"Consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we spend a lot of time on that."
324,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, there’s a lot going on—there are a lot of flows back and forth—but, ultimately, it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates."
331,CHAIR POWELL,So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law.
332,CHAIR POWELL,And inflation means headline inflation.
333,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s our ultimate goal.
334,CHAIR POWELL,"We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our tools."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools, so we look at that."
336,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations.
337,CHAIR POWELL,"We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices."
338,CHAIR POWELL,"And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too."
339,CHAIR POWELL,Also other things.
340,CHAIR POWELL,So we can’t really have much of an effect.
341,CHAIR POWELL,But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings].
342,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we—again, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core."
347,CHAIR POWELL,The SEP is of one piece.
348,CHAIR POWELL,It reflects all of the economic readings.
349,CHAIR POWELL,It also reflects the 75 basis point increase.
350,CHAIR POWELL,This is important.
351,CHAIR POWELL,So people had that in hand when they—when their SEPs were submitted.
352,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s—in other words, it’s not in addition to what’s in the SEP."
353,CHAIR POWELL,The SEP—everyone’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’s going forward.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time."
361,CHAIR POWELL,And that would tell us what’s—that would tell us about wages.
362,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, I’m not sure I’m getting to your question."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear."
366,CHAIR POWELL,But we’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers.
367,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will say, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which—it’s not an option."
368,CHAIR POWELL,We have to restore price stability.
369,CHAIR POWELL,"We really do, because everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy."
370,CHAIR POWELL,"If you don’t have price stability, the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to."
371,CHAIR POWELL,It won’t work for people—their wages will be eaten up.
372,CHAIR POWELL,So we want to get the job done.
373,CHAIR POWELL,This inflation happened relatively recently.
374,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.
375,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral.
376,CHAIR POWELL,"We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical."
377,CHAIR POWELL,It’s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.
378,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
384,CHAIR POWELL,"So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years."
386,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s really something people don’t like.
387,CHAIR POWELL,"And they’re experiencing that, and that’s showing up in their—in surveys and in all kinds of ways."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"And we understand that, and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we’re determined to do what we can to get inflation back down."
389,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really what we’re saying.
390,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"I guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time."
392,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well."
400,CHAIR POWELL,It was really in the goods sector at the beginning.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"And, particularly, you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ve flown on a plane lately—planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"Some of that will be pass-through of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation."
403,CHAIR POWELL,Shelter inflation is high.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see progress, and that’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says."
408,CHAIR POWELL,So I hope that’s responsive to your question.
413,CHAIR POWELL,So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.
414,CHAIR POWELL,"If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent."
415,CHAIR POWELL,That would be—I would call that as meeting that test.
417,CHAIR POWELL,I do.
418,CHAIR POWELL,I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want to be the handicapper here.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands."
422,CHAIR POWELL,"So we just don’t know, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic."
429,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
430,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that’s a good thing, we think."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent."
432,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate.
433,CHAIR POWELL,"And even if we did another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably."
434,CHAIR POWELL,"Still, that’s still a low rate."
435,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.
436,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3½ percent range by the end of this year, but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do."
438,CHAIR POWELL,"If we see data going in a different direction, it’ll be reflected in our policy, as you see today."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect, then we’re going to adapt."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain environment."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent."
451,CHAIR POWELL,"We—it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night."
452,CHAIR POWELL,But you have to understand the context.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"For—really, the context is this: For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"So and that’s how all the models work is, decades and decades of data—they look at that."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here."
457,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we have been, obviously, for quite a while."
458,CHAIR POWELL,But this is a different—these forces are different.
459,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand."
460,CHAIR POWELL,"But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that."
461,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re looking at it.
462,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means."
465,CHAIR POWELL,"The history is, you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’70s, and then they go away, and sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down."
466,CHAIR POWELL,"But, honestly, we don’t know what that’s going to be."
467,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere."
468,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary."
469,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not just here.
470,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered."
471,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what we’re doing.
472,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there."
473,CHAIR POWELL,Markets seem to be okay with it.
474,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming."
475,CHAIR POWELL,I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems.
476,CHAIR POWELL,It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point.
483,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
484,CHAIR POWELL,"So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that."
485,CHAIR POWELL,"And that was a—rates are low, and now they’re coming back up to more normal, or above, levels."
486,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously."
487,CHAIR POWELL,And so the demand was just suddenly much higher.
488,CHAIR POWELL,"And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years."
489,CHAIR POWELL,"So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market."
490,CHAIR POWELL,We’re watching it to see what will happen.
492,CHAIR POWELL,Not really sure.
494,CHAIR POWELL,Not really sure.
495,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching that quite carefully."
496,CHAIR POWELL,"You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low."
497,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s still a very tight market.
498,CHAIR POWELL,So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up.
499,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a complicated situation.
500,CHAIR POWELL,We watch it very carefully.
501,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say if you’re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset."
502,CHAIR POWELL,We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.
503,CHAIR POWELL,"So this will be a process whereby we—ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels."
504,CHAIR POWELL,So thank you very much.
