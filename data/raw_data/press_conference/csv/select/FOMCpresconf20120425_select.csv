0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then I’ll place the Committee’s policy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy."
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the Committee is maintaining the highly accommodative policies that we initiated at previous meetings."
3,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and we continue to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
4,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Our program to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s security holdings—announced in September—will continue as scheduled.
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Each of these policy actions is intended to foster accommodative financial conditions that support the economic recovery in a context of price stability.
6,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 5 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the long run."
7,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,These projections serve as important inputs into the Committee’s deliberations.
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.
9,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Most Committee participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually.
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Among other factors, and not withstanding some signs of improvement, the ongoing weakness of the housing sector still represents a headwind for recovery."
11,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Strains in global financial markets, though less pronounced, generally, than last fall, continue to pose significant risks to the outlook."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference Labor market conditions have improved in recent months, with the unemployment rate FINAL having fallen nearly a percentage point since August."
13,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Looking ahead, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years, reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth."
15,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Specifically, participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent, declining to 6.7 to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For comparison, participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
17,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, as has been the case for other recent swings in oil prices, the Committee expects that effect to be only temporary."
19,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show stability in longer-term inflation expectations."
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will subsequently run at or below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent."
21,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and 1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014."
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.
23,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you can see from the chart labeled “Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming,” Committee participants have a range of views about when the initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be appropriate."
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Following a careful discussion of those views at today’s meeting, the FOMC maintained its collective judgment that economic conditions will likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
25,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is warranted in light of the persistence of the factors restraining the pace of recovery and the ongoing risks to the economic outlook."
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Finally, the Committee took no new decisions regarding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet today, but we remain prepared to adjust our securities holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability."
27,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
28,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’d be glad to take your questions.
33,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first, the Committee has certainly been bold and aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy."
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ve maintained the federal funds rate close to zero since late 2008.
35,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ve had two rounds of so-called quantitative easing.
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ve had a maturity extension program, which is ongoing."
37,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We have offered guidance about the federal funds rate that goes into at least late 2014.
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we have been very accommodative, and we remain prepared to do more as needed to make sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close to target."
39,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, in particular, we will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks, whether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its longer-run normal level, and whether inflation is remaining close to target."
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, if appropriate, and depending also on assessment of the costs and risks of additional policy actions, we remain entirely prepared to take additional balance sheet actions if necessary to achieve our objectives."
41,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So those tools remain very much on the table, and we will not hesitate to use them should the economy require that additional support."
47,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I would just say, first, that our projections still have inflation very close to our 2 percent target."
48,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying inflation have been a little stronger than expected."
49,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I would say first that some of the movement in the first quarter, for example, seems to have come from transitory sources like nonmarket components."
50,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation expectations; the amount of slack in the economy; the commodity price behavior, which has been relatively well-controlled in recent months—all of those things suggest that inflation is going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target."
51,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a temporary bulge in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the system and, assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflation ought to moderate to about 2 percent later this year."
53,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The lower bound rose—again, this represents 17 distinct views—but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer, core inflation has been a little stronger than was expected."
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But those differences are not particularly large.
60,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I’m very comfortable with the consensus view that we enunciated today, and I think that the Committee broadly is comfortable—a 9-to-1 vote in favor of this guidance."
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So again, that represents a very accommodative stance of policy."
62,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Our intention is to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for the foreseeable future, and we remain able and willing to take further action if necessary."
63,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"At the same time, I think it is worth noting that the forward guidance on the federal funds rate is conditional on the data, and if the data were to come in much stronger than expected, we would adjust the guidance appropriately."
64,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So it’s not unconditional; it does depend on how the outlook evolves.
65,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And again, should the outlook strengthen notably, then we would have to respond to that."
69,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I can only say qualitatively that the Committee will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives, and, in particular, whether the recovery is still continuing."
70,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to help make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer-run normal levels.
74,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, there’s certainly a range of views, as you’ve noted, but these projections are inputs into a Committee process."
75,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And it’s in the Committee meeting that we had yesterday and today where we debate not only the possible outcomes, but also the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgment."
76,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as I said, the Committee had no difficulty coming to a consensus that the guidance that we gave is still appropriate."
77,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, if there’s a substantial change in the economic outlook in either direction, then the guidance would change appropriately."
78,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But for now, I think the Committee is comfortable with the consensus statement that we put out."
80,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, again, the individual projections are inputs to the Committee decision, so the Committee decision is the critical element in that respect."
81,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We are continuing to work to become more transparent, and we have a variety of things that we’re looking at, so you’ll have to stay tuned for that."
82,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, the Committee was quite comfortable with the consensus that we have reported today."
89,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Yeah.
90,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Let me tackle that second part first.
91,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there’s this view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are somehow inconsistent with our current policies.
92,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That is absolutely incorrect.
93,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Our—my views and our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time.
94,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I made two points at that time to the Bank of Japan.
95,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The first was that I believe that a determined central bank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is, falling prices."
96,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation."
97,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, looking at the current situation in United States, we are not in deflation."
98,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010, or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balance sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target."
99,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Likewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non-federal-funds-rate-centered tools to achieve additional accommodation for the U.S. economy."
100,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So the very critical difference between the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U.S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation, and, clearly, when you’re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation."
101,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In this case, it’s—we are not in deflation, we have an inflation rate that’s close to our objective."
103,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first I would again reiterate that we are doing a great deal; policy is extraordinarily accommodative."
104,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We—and I won’t go through the list again, but you know all the things that we have done to try to provide support to the economy."
106,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The view of the Committee is that that would be very reckless.
107,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four or five years to support the economy without leading to an unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation."
108,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do."
112,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think we’ll have to take fiscal policy into account to some extent, but I think it’s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there’s, I think, absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy."
113,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I—as I have said many times before, it’s imperative for Congress to give us a fiscal policy that achieves two principal objectives."
114,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The first is, of course, to achieve fiscal sustainability over the longer term; that is critical, and that’s something that needs to be addressed."
115,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"At the same time, I think that can be done in a way that doesn’t endanger the short-term recovery of the economy."
116,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I am concerned that if all the tax increases and spending cuts that are associated with the current law and which would take place—absent any congressional action—were to occur on January 1st, that that would be a significant risk to the recovery."
117,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I’m looking and hoping that Congress will take actions that will address both sides of that—both requirements of a good fiscal policy.
121,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, again, these are the views of the participants, the 17 participants."
122,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So the basic feature that is described in our statement, which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time, is still obviously in our projections."
123,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The 2013 numbers are stronger than the 2012 numbers, and the 2014 numbers are stronger than the 2013 numbers."
124,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the reason for that expected pickup over time is, first, a very accommodative monetary policy, which continues to provide support for the recovery."
125,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But in addition, some of the headwinds that have been affecting our recovery—such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit tightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over time and will allow the economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer-run full employment level."
126,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The reason—I don’t know precisely why there’s been a slight downgrade in years further out, but I suspect that the fiscal issues may be part of that."
129,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So it’s not a ceiling, it’s a symmetric objective, and we attempt to bring inflation close to 2 percent."
130,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason—and we don’t have, obviously don’t have perfect control of inflation—we’ll try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to unemployment."
131,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The risk of higher inflation—you say 2½ percent; well, 2½ percent expected change might involve a distribution of outcomes, some of which might be much higher than 2½ percent."
132,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well above 2 percent for a protracted period, that the credibility and the well-anchored inflation expectations, which are such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded, in which case we would in fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodative monetary policy to achieve our employment goals."
133,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would cite to you, just as an example, if you look at Vice Chair Yellen’s paper, which she gave—or speech, which she gave a couple of weeks ago, where she described a number of ways of looking at the late 2014 guidance."
134,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent."
135,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there is no presumption even in our econometric models that you need inflation well above target in order to make progress on unemployment.
142,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, it’s just supposed to be a factual description of what’s happening in the environment."
143,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In January, the financial markets had calmed considerably, reflecting a number of steps taken in Europe, including, notably, the two large long-term refinancing operations by the European Central Bank, which helped finance Europe’s banks for up to three years."
144,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In recent weeks, we’ve seen more market stress arising from concerns about the fiscal positions of Spain and Italy, and, you know, we’ve seen more volatility in our own markets related to that."
145,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’re simply taking note of the fact that a portion of the improvement that we saw late last year and early this year in European financial markets and in our own financial markets has been reversed recently, nothing more intended than that."
146,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you know, I had the opportunity over the weekend to speak with many of my European and other international colleagues because we had the G–20 and the IMF meetings here in Washington, and so we had plenty of opportunities to discuss the European situation."
147,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think it’s true that the Europeans have made substantial progress overall.
148,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I include not only the two LTRO operations, but also the Greek debt deal, the work on the fiscal compact, and recently the setting up of a larger financial firewall that could be used to avoid contagion should another country face serious financial distress."
149,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So progress has been made, but obviously, judging by market conditions, there’s still more work to be done, and we are counting on our European colleagues to continue to follow through their commitments and to put very strong effort into addressing what remain significant problems and concerns in Europe."
156,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Sure.
157,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with January, you’ll see that a few members have pulled in their expected date."
158,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But let me just reiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process."
159,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"They represent individual estimates, and, quite admittedly, as many of the participants said around the table, you know, these are uncertain from an individual point of view."
160,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as we discussed the range of considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I’ve talked about, for example, the so-called Okun’s law puzzle about whether or not unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out."
161,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Given those uncertainties, given the risks like the European situation or the fiscal cliff that we’ve just discussed here, that there was a quite reasonable case for maintaining the guidance at late 2014."
162,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as I said, there was a great deal of comfort among the participants and the Committee members with maintaining this guidance."
169,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Yes.
170,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I believe that too-big-to-fail was an important cause, or at least a propagating mechanism, of the financial crisis."
171,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I believe it’s absolutely incumbent upon us to do all we can to eliminate too-big-to-fail.
172,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And what I mean by that is, a situation where a failing firm is bailed out because its collapse would have such adverse circumstance—consequences for the rest of the financial system."
173,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we are working to get rid of too-big-to-fail, and I think making some progress."
174,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First of all, we are very substantially increasing the supervisory and regulatory oversight of large financial institutions; that includes, for example, the Basel III rules that require higher capital for all banks but particularly for systemically important banks, more liquidity requirements, stress tests, a range of tougher supervisory requirements that are—many of them are embedded in the rule we put out on 165–166, that section of the Dodd–Frank Act."
175,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So the first thing we’re going to do is make sure that these large institutions are stronger, that it’s much harder for them to fail, and that they are watched much more carefully and more actively by the supervisors."
176,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The other part of eliminating too-big-to-fail, though, is that, in that circumstance where a large complex financial firm does come to the brink of failure, that it must be allowed to fail; it must be safe to fail."
177,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And in that respect, one of the principal tools that we’ve gotten from Dodd–Frank is a so-called orderly liquidation authority, which is the FDIC’s tool, and the Federal Reserve is working closely with the FDIC there."
178,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The idea is to apply the same kind of bank resolution tools that the FDIC has used for many years on domestic banks to large complex financial firms.
179,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, obviously, the complexity and the international aspects of these firms make that a much more challenging task, but I think we’re making progress there."
180,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have put out rules about so-called living wills, which will require large financial firms to essentially plan out how they would be disassembled."
181,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we’ve continued to talk with international colleagues about how we would cooperate if a multinational firm had to be put into receivership.
182,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, indeed, part of the reason that there’s been some downgrade or potential downgrade for some U.S. financial institutions is the judgment of the ratings agencies that the so-called implicit government support that these institutions have is less than in the past."
183,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, I think, ultimately, what we’ll need to have is a situation where large firms are both making judgments about their size and complexity based only on the economic benefits and costs and not on too-big-to-fail considerations, and that if there is failure, that it can be done and achieved without highly adverse consequences for the financial system and the economy."
184,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And that’s our objective, and that’s the way, I think, to end too-big-to-fail."
187,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think that’s part of your job to say."
188,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think we’re making progress.
189,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is—I thought that was important.
190,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we put out a statement that described the overall policy approach of the Federal Reserve.
191,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ve taken a number of steps to improve communication, including these press conferences, of course."
192,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But also, by expanding our projections and by continued, you know, work doing press—doing,sorry, doing testimonies and speeches, and most recently as you know, I did some classes—I taught some classes at a local university."
193,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’re doing our best both—to achieve, really, two objectives."
194,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One is to help make the Fed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’t understand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy."
195,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And to be good voters and good citizens, they need to understand, you know, something about what the Fed does."
196,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know, what our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans."
197,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think the evidence on the latter point is that there is a better understanding of the Fed’s policies.
198,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, you know, we’ve seen, for example, less volatility in interest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do."
199,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I want to emphasize that this is an ongoing task, it’s a work in progress, and we’re going to continue to look for ways to make ourselves better understand—more understandable and more transparent to the public."
214,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"“Exceptionally low”; you know, one of the reasons that language in the statement is sometimes a little vaguer than you would like is because we are trying to get a consensus among 17 or at least 10 people, and different members or participants in the FOMC might have somewhat different views of what “exceptionally low” means."
215,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Personally, I think it means something close to where we are—where we are now."
224,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial institution is artificially large."
225,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial stability, then I suppose that considering breaking it up would be something that regulators should look at."
226,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"My own view, though, is that a more market-responsive way to address this problem is to eliminate the incentive to be too-big-to-fail."
227,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That is, to—through tougher supervisory oversight, through higher capital requirements, through greater liquidity requirements, through restrictions on interconnectedness, et cetera, take away the benefits or force firms to internalize the costs of being large and complex."
228,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And on the other side, as I was saying earlier, if we can safely unwind a failing firm, then we no longer have too-big-to-fail, obviously, and so I think that’s a very, very important objective."
229,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The test would be that the financial markets that lend to large firms base their bond spreads and what they’re willing to pay for the stock of those firms solely on the risk-taking and on the business model of those firms and not on the fact that there’s some anticipation of a government bailout.
230,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And so I think market indicators will help us see our progress towards ending too-big-to-fail.
236,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability, it’s not to disappoint or not disappoint investors."
237,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we will take actions based on those economic objectives and not try to achieve certain market outcomes.
238,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s some disagreement, I think, about exactly how balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices."
239,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The view that we have generally taken at the Fed, in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases—the flow of new purchases—which is the primary determinant of interest rates."
240,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minimal effects on interest rates at that time."
241,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And that, in fact, has been our—generally our experience in previous episodes where we have launched a program and then allowed it to come to a natural end."
242,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, we’ll continue to monitor the situation, and if we believe that financial conditions for whatever reason are inconsistent with our macroeconomic objectives, then we will act to fix that."
243,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, our expectation is that, at whatever point that the purchases end, that financial markets being quite forward looking will have anticipated that, and that the effects ought to be moderate."
249,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference AKIO FUJII."
251,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think the—I would draw two distinctions between the U.S. and Japan, or the Japanese experience."
252,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The first is that, as I mentioned earlier—and I think this is very important—is that we acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation."
253,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, of course, Japan had a much bigger bubble and a much bigger shock when the bubble collapsed, and so these differences may be certainly understandable."
254,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, we did avoid deflation."
255,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The other thing which I think we have done reasonably well here in the United States was that we moved fairly quickly to make sure that our banks were recapitalized and were recognizing their bad assets.
256,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think the stress tests that we conducted last month are good evidence that the U.S. banking system is considerably stronger and, indeed, much more resilient than it was a couple of years ago."
257,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So those two things are positives and would tend to suggest that we will avoid some of the problems that Japan has faced.
258,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, I think it’s always better to be humble and just to, you know, avoid being too confident."
259,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation.
267,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On declaring victory, I think it’s a little premature to declare victory."
268,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.
269,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons; they include monetary policy, of course, but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations, and safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasuries."
270,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, of course, interest rates will rise at some point."
271,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We hope that they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening.
272,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I think it’s important for holders of long-term securities to manage their risks and pay attention to that.
273,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But all that being said, I think, again, that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low."
274,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The first part of your question was— SCOTT SPOERRY.
275,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,About the— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
276,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Oh, participation, labor participation, yes."
277,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Actually, we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting because it is an important issue, trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical, and so on."
278,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There is, in fact, a downward trend in labor participation in the United States."
279,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It comes from, first, the fact that we’re no longer getting increased participation from women; female participation has leveled out."
280,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, secondly, because, as the society ages, and also for other reasons, male participation has been declining over time."
281,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there is a downward trend that we have to take into account.
282,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The participants at the meeting, at least some of them, suggested, though, that a good bit of the decline in participation that we’ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical factors."
283,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Much of it is young people, for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely, but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working."
284,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for work, which I think would be a good thing."
285,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But we’ll just have to see.
286,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I do think—I think I would agree with the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors and should reverse when the economy gets stronger.
291,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be to make real-time assessments of the state of the economy."
292,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The weather has probably affected a number of things.
293,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It probably brought forward some of the hiring so that it made perhaps January and February artificially strong and March perhaps artificially a little bit weak.
294,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It probably affected construction, manufacturing."
295,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s a number of things that were probably affected to some extent by the unusually warm weather that we had this winter, and we’re doing our best to try to adjust for that."
296,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re also looking at some of the seasonality issues that have arisen because of the unusually large recession in 2008 and 2009.
297,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, again, that makes the data harder to interpret."
298,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference I advanced the hypothesis that the increase in employment we’ve seen in the last five, six FINAL months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a one-time catch-up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009."
299,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s only a hypothesis.
300,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ll have to see going forward.
301,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If it’s correct, then job gains will be somewhat less than the 250,000 a month that we’ve been seeing recently."
302,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But we don’t know yet, we don’t know yet."
303,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I wouldn’t draw too much conclusion from the March report.
304,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think, again, because of weather and other factors, we really can’t take a conclusive result from that."
305,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we’ll continue to be watching the labor market."
306,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s a very important consideration.
307,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If unemployment looks like it’s no longer making progress, that’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy options."
309,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we need something—estimates differ."
310,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past—I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability."
311,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I don’t have an exact answer, but broadly speaking, 150–200,000 jobs or so."
312,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But that’s a very rough estimate, and, of course, individual participants may have different views."
313,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, that’s not a forecast, I’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment."
314,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But the possibility, of course, exists that this recovery will generate a virtuous circle with greater hiring, which in turn generates more consumer spending, and greater hiring, and so on."
315,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That remains to be seen, and, of course, which way that goes is going to be a very important determinant of our response."
316,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference PETER COOK."
317,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television."
318,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you for FINAL the time.
321,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, those things are not all the same."
322,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the former, our subcommittee, headed by Vice Chair Yellen, is looking at the SEP for ways to improve transparency, and we’re looking at everything."
323,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, your particular suggestion is on the table, as are other ways to try to make this more useful."
324,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, again, it’s a work in progress, as I said before."
325,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The most frustrating aspect, I guess, of the recovery has been that it’s—has been that it’s been quite slow."
326,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the expansion, and the unemployment rate is still over 8 percent."
327,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’re looking and hoping that as the headwinds lift, as financial stresses ease, as housing improves, that we’ll begin to get more rapid improvement in the economy and in the labor market."
328,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it has been a very long slog, and that, I think, would be the single most concerning thing."
329,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"From a policy perspective, there are many issues, like the fiscal issues, for example."
330,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But within the province of the Federal Reserve, I think it would be the pace of improvement in the labor market."
331,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
