0,CHAIR YELLEN,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR YELLEN,"Earlier today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¼ to ½ percent."
2,CHAIR YELLEN,This action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.
3,CHAIR YELLEN,"It also recognizes the considerable progress that has been made toward restoring jobs, raising incomes, and easing the economic hardship of millions of Americans."
4,CHAIR YELLEN,And it reflects the Committee’s confidence that the economy will continue to strengthen.
5,CHAIR YELLEN,"The economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not yet complete."
6,CHAIR YELLEN,"Room for further improvement in the labor market remains, and inflation continues to run below our longer-run objective."
7,CHAIR YELLEN,"But with the economy performing well and expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate target is now appropriate, recognizing that even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative."
8,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I will explain, the process of normalizing interest rates is likely to proceed gradually, although future policy actions will obviously depend on how the economy evolves relative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
9,CHAIR YELLEN,"Since March, the Committee has stated that it would raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
10,CHAIR YELLEN,"In our judgment, these two criteria have now been satisfied."
11,CHAIR YELLEN,The labor market has clearly shown significant further improvement toward our objective of maximum employment.
12,CHAIR YELLEN,"So far this year, a total of 2.3 million jobs have been added to the December 16, 2015 economy, and over the most recent three months, job gains have averaged an estimated 218,000 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL per month, similar to the average pace since the beginning of the year."
13,CHAIR YELLEN,"The unemployment rate, at 5 percent in November, is down 0.6 percentage point from the end of last year and is close to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
14,CHAIR YELLEN,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time also has shown solid improvement.
15,CHAIR YELLEN,"That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains: The labor force participation rate is still below estimates of its demographic trend, involuntary part-time employment remains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup."
16,CHAIR YELLEN,The improvement in employment conditions this year has occurred amid continued expansion in economic activity.
17,CHAIR YELLEN,U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased at an average pace of 2¼ percent over the first three quarters of the year.
18,CHAIR YELLEN,"Net exports have been restrained by subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar, but this weakness has been offset by solid expansion of domestic spending."
19,CHAIR YELLEN,"Continued job gains and increases in real disposable income have supported household spending, and purchases of new motor vehicles have been particularly strong."
20,CHAIR YELLEN,"Residential investment has been rising at a faster pace than last year, although the level of new homebuilding still remains low."
21,CHAIR YELLEN,"And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in investment outlays, business investment has posted solid gains."
22,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
23,CHAIR YELLEN,Although developments abroad still pose risks to U.S.
24,CHAIR YELLEN,"December 16, 2015 economic growth, these risks appear to have lessened since last summer."
25,CHAIR YELLEN,"Overall, the Committee Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced."
26,CHAIR YELLEN,The anticipation of ongoing economic growth and additional improvement in labor market conditions is an important factor underpinning the Committee’s confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
27,CHAIR YELLEN,Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was only ¼ percent over the 12 months ending in October.
28,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, much of the shortfall from our 2 percent objective reflected the sharp declines in energy prices since the middle of last year, and the effects of these declines should dissipate over time."
29,CHAIR YELLEN,The appreciation of the dollar has also weighed on inflation by holding down import prices.
30,CHAIR YELLEN,"As these transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
31,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee’s confidence in the inflation outlook rests importantly on its judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.
32,CHAIR YELLEN,"In this regard, although some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations have edged down, overall they have been reasonably stable."
33,CHAIR YELLEN,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near historically low levels, although the declines in these measures over the past year and a half may reflect changes in risk and liquidity premiums rather than an outright decline in inflation expectations."
34,CHAIR YELLEN,"Our statement emphasizes that, in considering future policy decisions, we will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
35,CHAIR YELLEN,This general assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted for this meeting by FOMC participants.
36,CHAIR YELLEN,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
37,CHAIR YELLEN,"Participants’ projections for real GDP growth are little changed from the projections made in conjunction with the September December 16, 2015 FOMC meeting."
38,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for real GDP growth is 2.1 percent for this year and Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rises to 2.4 percent in 2016, somewhat above the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
39,CHAIR YELLEN,"Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer-run rate."
40,CHAIR YELLEN,"The median projection for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year stands at 5 percent, close to the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
41,CHAIR YELLEN,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further next year and then leveling out.
42,CHAIR YELLEN,"The path of the median unemployment rate is slightly lower than in September, and while the median longer-run normal unemployment rate has not changed, some participants edged down their estimates."
43,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower prices for energy and non-energy imports."
44,CHAIR YELLEN,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor market conditions continue to strengthen, the median inflation projection rises from just 0.4 percent this year to 1.6 percent next year and reaches 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018."
45,CHAIR YELLEN,The path of the median inflation projections is little changed from September.
47,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I have already noted, much of the recent softness in inflation is due to transitory factors that we expect to abate over time, and diminishing slack in labor and product markets should put upward pressure on inflation as well."
48,CHAIR YELLEN,"In addition, we recognize that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes."
49,CHAIR YELLEN,"Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting our objective."
50,CHAIR YELLEN,Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.
51,CHAIR YELLEN,"As I have often noted, the importance of our initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate should not be overstated: Even after today’s increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
52,CHAIR YELLEN,"As we indicated in our statement, “the Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near potential—is currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time."
53,CHAIR YELLEN,One indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been only moderate in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities.
54,CHAIR YELLEN,"Had the neutral rate been running closer to its longer-run level, these policy actions would have been expected to foster a much more rapid economic expansion."
55,CHAIR YELLEN,The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on aggregate demand.
56,CHAIR YELLEN,"Following the financial crisis, these headwinds included tighter underwriting standards and limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy, weak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook."
57,CHAIR YELLEN,"Although the restraint imposed by many of these factors has declined noticeably over December 16, 2015 the past few years, some of these effects have remained significant."
58,CHAIR YELLEN,"As these effects abate, the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL neutral federal funds rate should gradually move higher over time."
59,CHAIR YELLEN,This view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
60,CHAIR YELLEN,The median projection for the federal funds rate rises gradually to nearly 1½ percent in late 2016 and 2½ percent in late 2017.
61,CHAIR YELLEN,"As the factors restraining economic growth continue to fade over time, the median rate rises to 3¼ percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level."
62,CHAIR YELLEN,"Compared with the projections made in September, a number of participants lowered somewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, although changes to the median path are fairly minor."
63,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, as usual, are conditional on participants’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment and inflation, and other factors."
64,CHAIR YELLEN,"However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."
65,CHAIR YELLEN,"Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well."
66,CHAIR YELLEN,"Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, the federal funds rate would likely rise more slowly."
67,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
68,CHAIR YELLEN,"As highlighted in our policy statement, we anticipate continuing this policy “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.” Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should December 16, 2015 reduce the risk that the federal funds rate might return to the effective lower bound in the event Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL of future adverse shocks."
69,CHAIR YELLEN,"Finally, in conjunction with our policy statement, we also released an implementation note that provides details on the tools that we are using to raise the federal funds rate into the new target range."
70,CHAIR YELLEN,"Specifically, the Board of Governors raised the interest rate paid on required and excess reserves to ½ percent, and the FOMC authorized overnight reverse repurchase operations at an offering rate of ¼ percent."
71,CHAIR YELLEN,Both of these changes will be effective tomorrow.
72,CHAIR YELLEN,"To ensure sufficient monetary control at the onset of the normalization process, we have, for the time being, suspended the aggregate cap on overnight reverse repurchase transactions that has been in place during the testing phase of this facility."
73,CHAIR YELLEN,Recall that the Committee intends to phase out this facility when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.
74,CHAIR YELLEN,The Board of Governors also approved a ¼ percentage point increase in the discount rate for primary credit to 1 percent.
75,CHAIR YELLEN,"Based on the extensive testing of our policy tools in recent years, the Committee is confident that the normalization process will proceed smoothly."
76,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nonetheless, as part of prudent contingency planning, we will be monitoring financial market developments closely in the coming days and are prepared to make adjustments to our tools if that proves necessary to maintain appropriate control over money market rates."
77,CHAIR YELLEN,Thank you.
78,CHAIR YELLEN,I will be happy to take your questions.
85,CHAIR YELLEN,"We decided to move at this time because we feel the conditions that we set out for a move—namely, further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term—we felt that these conditions had been satisfied."
86,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have been concerned, as you know, about the risks from the global economy, and those risks persist, but the U.S. economy has shown considerable strength."
87,CHAIR YELLEN,Domestic spending that accounts for 85 percent of aggregate spending in the U.S. economy has continued to hold up.
88,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s grown at a solid pace.
89,CHAIR YELLEN,"And while there is a drag from net exports, from relatively weak growth abroad, and the appreciation of the dollar, overall, we decided today that the risks to the outlook for the labor market and the economy are balanced."
90,CHAIR YELLEN,And we recognize that monetary policy operates with lags.
91,CHAIR YELLEN,"We would like to be able to move in a prudent and, as we’ve emphasized, gradual manner."
92,CHAIR YELLEN,"It’s been a long time since the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, and I think it’s prudent to be able to watch what the impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion enables us to do this."
93,CHAIR YELLEN,"Again, I think it’s important not to overblow the significance of this first move."
94,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s only 25 basis points.
95,CHAIR YELLEN,It—monetary policy remains accommodative.
96,CHAIR YELLEN,We have indicated that we will be watching what happens very carefully in the economy in terms of our actual and forecast—our projected conditions relative to our employment and inflation goals and will adjust policy over time as seems appropriate to achieve those goals.
97,CHAIR YELLEN,"Our expectation, as I’ve indicated, is that policy adjustments will be gradual over time, but, of course, they will be informed by the outlook, which in turn will evolve with incoming data."
106,CHAIR YELLEN,“Neutral” is not a policy goal.
107,CHAIR YELLEN,It is an assessment.
108,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s a benchmark that I think is usual—is useful for assessing the stance of policy.
109,CHAIR YELLEN,"Neutral is essentially a stance of policy, a level of short-term rates, which, if the economy were operating near its potential—and we’re reasonably not quite at that, but reasonably close to it—it would be a level that would maintain or sustain those conditions."
110,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, at this point, policy we judge to be accommodative."
111,CHAIR YELLEN,"The Committee forecasts that the unemployment rate will continue to decline, and I think that’s important and appropriate for two reasons."
112,CHAIR YELLEN,"First of all, as I’ve indicated, I continue to judge that there remains slack in the economy, margins of slack that are not reflected in the standard unemployment rate, and, in particular, I’ve pointed to the depressed level of labor force participation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of part-time employment."
113,CHAIR YELLEN,So a further decline in the unemployment rate and strengthening of labor market conditions will help to erode those margins of slack.
114,CHAIR YELLEN,"But also we want to see inflation move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and so seeing above-trend growth and continuing tightness—greater tightness in labor and product markets—I think that will help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation."
116,CHAIR YELLEN,We have kept rates at an extremely low level and had a high balance sheet for a very long time.
117,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have considered the risks to the outlook and worried about the fact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to respond to negative shocks than to positive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy."
118,CHAIR YELLEN,That is a factor that has induced us to hold rates at zero for this long.
119,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we recognize that policy is accommodative, and if we do not begin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy would end up overshooting both our employment and inflation objectives."
120,CHAIR YELLEN,"What I—we would like to avoid is a situation where we have waited so long that we’re forced to tighten policy abruptly, which risks aborting what I would like to see as a very long-running and sustainable expansion."
121,CHAIR YELLEN,"So to keep the economy moving along the growth path it’s on with improving and solid conditions in labor markets, we would like to avoid a situation where we have left so much accommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these objectives and then have to tighten abruptly and risk damaging—damaging that performance."
127,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, we recognize that inflation is well below our 2 percent goal."
128,CHAIR YELLEN,"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective."
129,CHAIR YELLEN,The Committee is equally committed—this is a symmetric goal—and the Committee is equally committed to not allowing inflation to persist below our 2 percent objective.
130,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, I’ve tried to explain—and many of my colleagues have as well—why we have reasonable confidence that inflation will move up over time, and the Committee declared it had reasonable confidence."
131,CHAIR YELLEN,"Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and we really need to monitor over time actual inflation performance to make sure that it is conforming, it is evolving, in the manner that we expect."
132,CHAIR YELLEN,"So it doesn’t mean that we need to see inflation reach 2 percent before moving again, but we have expectations for how inflation will behave."
133,CHAIR YELLEN,"And were we to find that the underlying theory is not bearing out, that it is not behaving in the manner that we expect, and that it doesn’t look like the shortfall is transitory and disappearing with tighter labor markets, that would certainly give us pause."
134,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we have indicated that we’re reasonably close—not quite there, but reasonably close—to achieving our maximum employment objective, but we have a significant shortfall on inflation."
135,CHAIR YELLEN,And so we’re calling attention to the importance of verifying our—that things evolve in line with our forecasts.
138,CHAIR YELLEN,I’m not going to give you a simple formula for what we need to see on the inflation front in order to raise rates again.
139,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ll also be looking at the path of employment as well as the path for inflation.
140,CHAIR YELLEN,"But if incoming data were—led us to call into December 16, 2015 question the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL of evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause."
141,CHAIR YELLEN,But I don’t want to say there’s a simple benchmark.
142,CHAIR YELLEN,"We—you know, the Committee expects inflation—over the next year, the median expectation is for inflation to be running about 1.6 percent, and—both core and headline."
143,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we do expect it to be moving up, but we don’t expect it to reach 2 percent."
154,CHAIR YELLEN,"First, let me say with respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by the further downward movement in oil prices, but we do not need to see oil prices rebound to higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out."
155,CHAIR YELLEN,So all they need to do is stabilize.
156,CHAIR YELLEN,I believe there is some limit below which oil prices are unlikely to rise.
157,CHAIR YELLEN,If we look—to fall.
158,CHAIR YELLEN,"If we look at market expectations, market expectations are for stabilization and then some gradual upward movement."
159,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I certainly grant that we’ve had a series of shocks pushing them down, December 16, 2015 but we’re not looking for them to revert back to the—to higher levels that they were at merely to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL stabilize."
160,CHAIR YELLEN,"We—I would point out, you asked me, would we tolerate overshoots."
161,CHAIR YELLEN,"For a number of years between 2004 and 2008, we had a series of increases in oil prices that for a series of years raised inflation above—again, we didn’t have a 2 percent objective then, but—raised it above 2 percent, and we judged those increases to be transitory as well and looked through them."
162,CHAIR YELLEN,We do monitor inflation expectations very carefully.
163,CHAIR YELLEN,"If we saw in a meaningful way that inflation expectations were either moving up in a way that made it—them seem unanchored or down, that would be of concern."
164,CHAIR YELLEN,And we have called attention to some slight downward movements in survey measures.
165,CHAIR YELLEN,"We are watching that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored."
166,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, yes, we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that we thought would disappear over the medium term just as we did overshoots of inflation that we also judged to be transitory."
167,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we do need to monitor inflation very carefully because if energy prices and the dollar were to stabilize, import prices, our expectation is that both headline and core inflation would move up."
168,CHAIR YELLEN,"And if we failed to see that occurring in the manner that we expect, of course we need to take further action to reconsider the outlook and to put in place appropriate policy."
170,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, you know, if the economy were disappointing, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflation, we would also take employment into account."
171,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I can’t give you a simple answer, but we would pursue a more accommodative policy because we do—certainly are committed to achieving 2 percent over the medium term."
178,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, there are number of different channels through which monetary policy is transmitted to spending decisions."
179,CHAIR YELLEN,"The behavior of longer-term—longer-term interest rates, short-term interest rates matter."
180,CHAIR YELLEN,"The value of asset prices and the exchange rate, also—these are transmission channels."
181,CHAIR YELLEN,"We wouldn’t be focused on short-term financial volatility, but were there unanticipated changes in financial conditions that were persistent and we judged to affect the outlook, we would of course have to take those into account."
183,CHAIR YELLEN,"Yes, we would, but it’s not short-term volatility in markets."
186,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, look, you know, we—this is not an unanticipated policy move, and we have been trying to explain what our policy strategy is."
187,CHAIR YELLEN,"So it’s not as though I’m expecting to see a marked, immediate reaction in financial markets."
188,CHAIR YELLEN,"Expectations about Fed policy have been built into the structure of financial market prices, but we obviously will track carefully the behavior of both short- and longer-term interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices, and if they move in persistent and significant ways that are out of line with the expectations that we have, then of course we will take those into account."
193,CHAIR YELLEN,"So let me start by saying that I feel confident about the fundamentals driving the U.S. economy, the health of U.S. households, and domestic spending."
194,CHAIR YELLEN,"There are pressures on some sectors of the economy, particularly manufacturing and the energy sector, reflecting global developments and developments in commodity markets and energy markets, but the underlying health of the U.S. economy I consider to be quite sound."
195,CHAIR YELLEN,I think it’s a myth that expansions die of old age.
196,CHAIR YELLEN,I do not think that they die of old age.
197,CHAIR YELLEN,So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesn’t lead me to believe that it’s one that has—its days are numbered.
198,CHAIR YELLEN,"But the economy does get hit by shocks, and there are both positive shocks and negative shocks."
199,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so there is a significant odd, you know, probability in any year that the economy will suffer some shock that we don’t know about that will put it into recession."
200,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so I’m not sure exactly how high that probability is in any year, but maybe at least on the order of 10 percent."
201,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, yes, there is some probability that that could happen, and of course we’d appropriately respond, but it isn’t something that is fated to happen because we’ve had a long expansion, and I don’t see anything in the underlying strength of the economy that would lead me to be concerned about that outcome."
204,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, during the years in which we were—you know, the economy was recovering from the Great Recession and we put further policy and measures in place, we studied our policy options quite carefully."
205,CHAIR YELLEN,"As you know, communications policy to affect market expectations about the path of interest rates played an important role."
206,CHAIR YELLEN,That’s something we did in conjunction with asset purchases.
207,CHAIR YELLEN,"Obviously, we lowered our overnight interest rate effectively to zero."
208,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, we have seen some foreign central banks, Europe—the ECB and others—that have taken their overnight rate into negative territory, and that’s something that—I don’t contemplate that we will need to do this, but it is something that we could study."
209,CHAIR YELLEN,"Of course, we have balance sheet policies, and there might be a range of direct policies that we could use as well."
210,CHAIR YELLEN,"But this is something that we have thought about, our range of options."
217,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, in our normalization principles, which are in effect, the Committee stated that we eventually want to operate with a much smaller balance sheet of—than we have at present."
218,CHAIR YELLEN,The—we would reduce the size of the balance sheet to essentially whatever size we needed to manage monetary policy effective—in an effective and efficient way.
219,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, a lot has changed since pre–financial crisis in terms of the financial system, and we are studying—we are engaging in a project at this time to consider what our long-run operating framework should look like."
220,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I can’t tell you exactly what size of balance sheet we will determine is the December 16, 2015 best to operate in an efficient and effective manner."
221,CHAIR YELLEN,It might be somewhat larger than the very Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL tiny quantity of reserves that we had in pre-crisis.
222,CHAIR YELLEN,We have not determined that.
223,CHAIR YELLEN,We have also said that we will—we expect to reduce the size of our balance sheet over time by cease—diminishing or ceasing entirely reinvestments.
224,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, beyond that, we haven’t given additional guidance other than to say that the timing of reductions in reinvestment will depend on economic and financial conditions."
225,CHAIR YELLEN,"And I suppose the additional guidance we’re giving today, when we say “well under way,” we want to see—as I mentioned, there are number of considerations, and the Committee has made no further decisions about this, but as we’ve discussed, the factors that will be relevant to the decision—one factor that we’ve talked about is the desirability of having some scope to respond to an adverse shock to the economy by lowering the federal funds rate."
226,CHAIR YELLEN,And so it would be nice to have a buffer in terms of having raised the federal funds rate to a certain extent to give us some meaningful scope to respond.
227,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, I don’t have in mind any particular level of the federal funds rate."
228,CHAIR YELLEN,"It would depend on the entire economic outlook, how robust the economy is."
229,CHAIR YELLEN,"But that is an important consideration for the Committee, and it means that this is not something that we expect to be turning to, to cease reinvestment very quickly."
236,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, risk spreads in the high-yield bond market have been widening since last year, partly reflecting falling oil prices—only partly, but partly—and redemptions in high-yield bond funds have been increasing in recent months."
237,CHAIR YELLEN,But Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund was a rather unusual open-end mutual fund.
238,CHAIR YELLEN,"It had very concentrated positions in especially risky and illiquid bonds, and it had been facing very significant redemption pressures."
239,CHAIR YELLEN,My understanding is that the SEC is in touch with Third Avenue.
240,CHAIR YELLEN,"And, as you probably know, the SEC has proposed some reforms to address what’s a structural problem of liquidity mismatch in open-end mutual funds."
241,CHAIR YELLEN,So we continue to believe that financial conditions are supportive of economic growth.
242,CHAIR YELLEN,We will be—we have been and will continue to track developments in financial markets very carefully.
243,CHAIR YELLEN,I would say that I think we have a far more resilient financial system now than we had prior to the financial crisis and highly capital[ized] banks that are well situated to support corporate lending.
244,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’d also point out that many corporations during these years have reduced their interest payments and extended their debt profiles, and I think that should help to mitigate spillovers, but we will be evaluating this carefully."
250,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, when you say that central banks often kill them, I think the usual reason that that has been true when that has been true is that central banks have begun too late to tighten policy, and they’ve allowed inflation to get out of control."
251,CHAIR YELLEN,"And at that point, they have had to tighten policy very abruptly and very substantially, and it’s caused a downturn, and the downturn has served to lower inflation."
252,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, if you don’t mind my flipping the question on you, I would point out that it is because we don’t want to cause a recession through that type of dynamic at some future date that it is prudent to begin early and gradually."
253,CHAIR YELLEN,"Now, it is true that some central banks have raised rates and later turned around."
254,CHAIR YELLEN,Not in every case has that reflected a policy mistake.
255,CHAIR YELLEN,Economies are subject to shocks.
256,CHAIR YELLEN,"Sometimes when they have raised rates, it hasn’t been the wrong thing to do, but conditions have changed in a way that they have had to reverse policy to respond to shocks."
257,CHAIR YELLEN,I’m not denying that there are situations where central banks have moved too early.
258,CHAIR YELLEN,We have considered the risk of that.
259,CHAIR YELLEN,We have weighed that risk carefully in making today’s decision.
260,CHAIR YELLEN,I don’t believe we’ll have to do it.
261,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, look, you know, as I’ve—as the Committee has said, we’re watching economic developments closely, and we will adjust policy in whatever way is necessary to support the attainment of our objectives."
265,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I think the first—the first thing that Americans should realize is that the Fed’s decision today reflects our confidence in the U.S. economy, that we believe we have seen substantial improvement in labor market conditions, and while things may be uneven December 16, 2015 across regions of the country and different industrial sectors, we see an economy that is on a path Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL of sustainable improvement."
266,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their financial prospects going forward, I hope they will take this decision as one that signals the FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen and job market prospects will be good."
267,CHAIR YELLEN,It is a very small move.
268,CHAIR YELLEN,It will be reflected in some changes in borrowing rates.
269,CHAIR YELLEN,Longer-term interest rates—loans that are linked to longer-term interest rates are unlikely to move—to move very much.
270,CHAIR YELLEN,"Some—for example, some corporate loans are linked to the prime rate, which is likely to move up with the fed funds rate, and those interest rates will adjust."
271,CHAIR YELLEN,"There are some consumer borrowing rates, I think credit card rates, that are linked to short-term rates that might move up slightly."
272,CHAIR YELLEN,"But, remember, we have very low rates, and we have made a very small move."
277,CHAIR YELLEN,Interest rate risk at banks is something that we have been monitoring very carefully for quite a long time.
278,CHAIR YELLEN,The community banks and smaller banking organizations that we work with—part of our supervision has been ensuring that they manage appropriately for interest rate risk.
279,CHAIR YELLEN,And the larger banking organizations that are subject to the stress tests and capital planning—the scenarios that we have presented in each of the last three years look at their ability to withstand what would be much sharper increases in interest rates than we’re envisioning would happen.
280,CHAIR YELLEN,But we want to make sure that if there were sharper increases—unlike our expectations—that they would be well positioned to handle it.
281,CHAIR YELLEN,"And we have December 16, 2015 concluded that—that their capital positions are sufficient for them to weather it."
282,CHAIR YELLEN,So this has been Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL very much on our minds.
287,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, we have said that we will carefully monitor both actual and expected progress."
288,CHAIR YELLEN,"You know, I think that standard Fed policy has been to look through shocks that are transitory."
289,CHAIR YELLEN,"Occasionally, there are sequences of transitory shocks."
290,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have had some further declines in energy prices, and, you know, as I said previously, I do expect there is a bottom to that."
291,CHAIR YELLEN,I expect we will be seeing it.
292,CHAIR YELLEN,"If we—if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that."
293,CHAIR YELLEN,"But if we concluded that there were structural factors or that there were a problem with our theory or some global deflationary force that were simply persistently holding down inflation in a way that was not transitory—and I don’t want to attach any simplistic meaning to what we would need to see to conclude that in the inflation data, but if we concluded that, we certainly would take action to make sure we adjusted policy so that we attain our 2 percent objective."
294,CHAIR YELLEN,But we would need to feel that what we were seeing in the data suggested a sustained departure from our 2 percent objective that we really needed to address.
300,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, starting with the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics that bear on the inflation outlook, and the median CPI has been somewhat more stable and running closer to 2 percent than the PCE, but there is a systematic gap between these two measures, and our objective is 2 percent on the PCE price index, and so there’s no simple translation."
301,CHAIR YELLEN,We do have a PCE inflation objective.
302,CHAIR YELLEN,"Sorry, let’s see, the other—the upside risks."
303,CHAIR YELLEN,"So I—there are upside risks to the economy, and I think, you know, we tend to focus on the downside risk."
304,CHAIR YELLEN,It’s right to do so.
305,CHAIR YELLEN,We want to be careful about downside risks.
306,CHAIR YELLEN,But consumers are in much healthier financial condition.
307,CHAIR YELLEN,Their income prospects have improved.
308,CHAIR YELLEN,We see them buying a lot of cars.
309,CHAIR YELLEN,"Housing has been recovering very slowly, but the demographics would point to considerable upside for residential investment."
310,CHAIR YELLEN,"My mainline forecast is for gradual recovery, but there is upside risk there."
311,CHAIR YELLEN,"We have seen that the decline in drilling has been depressing investment spending, but there’s upside risk too."
312,CHAIR YELLEN,"The global economy—we tend to focus—there are many countries that are undergoing very difficult adjustments or slowing growth, especially with declining commodity prices."
313,CHAIR YELLEN,"But even recently, we’ve seen growth in emerging markets strengthen."
314,CHAIR YELLEN,"And—so it is not only downside risks, but, you know, we do pay attention to downside risks."
315,CHAIR YELLEN,But the Committee said they regard the risks overall as balanced.
319,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, we will try to avoid that."
320,CHAIR YELLEN,"I do want to emphasize that while we have said “gradual,” gradual does not mean mechanical, evenly timed, equally sized interest rate changes."
321,CHAIR YELLEN,So that is not what the Committee means by it.
322,CHAIR YELLEN,My guess is that the economy will progress in a manner that is not sufficiently even that we will decide to make evenly spaced hikes.
323,CHAIR YELLEN,"I recognize we want to do what’s appropriate, and I recognize that’s a danger."
324,CHAIR YELLEN,But I do want to assure you that we will be data dependent.
325,CHAIR YELLEN,"As the outlook evolves, we’ll respond appropriately."
326,CHAIR YELLEN,"I strongly doubt that it will mean equally spaced hikes, and it certainly is not the intention of the Committee to follow any mechanical formula of that type."
333,CHAIR YELLEN,"Well, so the reason—the main reason that we revised down our projection ever so slightly—it’s hardly revised for core inflation—is because we have seen further appreciation of the dollar that’s holding down import prices that spills over into core inflation."
334,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, my own estimation is that core inflation will pick up."
335,CHAIR YELLEN,"There are various idiosyncratic factors that affect core inflation—for example, nonmarket price increases, which are a little bit hard to understand, have been running at a slow pace."
336,CHAIR YELLEN,"There were factors that have December 16, 2015 been affecting inflation in medical care prices that may change over time."
337,CHAIR YELLEN,So there is some Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL idiosyncratic factors.
338,CHAIR YELLEN,But I personally don’t think we’re in a world where inflation is being determined in a different way than it has historically.
339,CHAIR YELLEN,"I see import prices and energy prices as holding down headline but also core, and I do believe it will pick up."
340,CHAIR YELLEN,"But as we’ve said, if that theory is wrong and we do not see inflation is unfolding in the way the Committee expects, we will make adjustments over time in policy."
343,CHAIR YELLEN,"I mean, we have many people who are studying inflation models."
344,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’ve, you know, tried to—let me express some humility about them."
345,CHAIR YELLEN,I do not think that they’re perfect.
346,CHAIR YELLEN,Monetary policy is based on economic forecasts.
347,CHAIR YELLEN,There are theories of how the economy works that govern many aspects of economic forecasting.
348,CHAIR YELLEN,"Whether it’s consumer spending or residential investment or inflation, the underlying theories are not perfect, and they are subject to uncertainty."
349,CHAIR YELLEN,"And this is true in all aspects of forecasting, which is why we change our forecasts and our models."
350,CHAIR YELLEN,We throw out models that are persistently not working.
351,CHAIR YELLEN,We’re always trying to develop better models.
352,CHAIR YELLEN,"I’m not aware, I will say, of a different model of inflation that would be superior to the one that we employ."
353,CHAIR YELLEN,"But we have to verify that inflation is moving in the manner that we expect, and if it’s not, we need to adjust policy accordingly."
357,CHAIR YELLEN,"So we are constantly monitoring foreign economic developments, including those in emerging markets."
358,CHAIR YELLEN,"We understand that in the global economy, with integrated product and capital markets, that our fates are very much linked, and that the performance of the U.S. economy has important spillovers onto emerging markets and vice versa."
359,CHAIR YELLEN,We have been trying very carefully—we’ve made a commitment to emerging market policymakers that we would do our best to communicate as clearly as we could about our policy intentions to avoid spillovers that might result from abrupt or unanticipated policy moves.
360,CHAIR YELLEN,"I think this move has been expected and well communicated—at least, I hope that it has."
361,CHAIR YELLEN,So I don’t think it’s a surprise.
362,CHAIR YELLEN,This action takes place in the context of a U.S. economy that is doing well and is a source of strength to the emerging markets and other economies around the globe.
363,CHAIR YELLEN,"And so—that is, there can be negative spillovers through capital flows, but remember, there are also positive spillovers from a strong U.S. economy."
364,CHAIR YELLEN,"My general view is that many emerging markets are in a stronger position than they would have been in the 1990s—for example, that they have stronger macroeconomic policies."
365,CHAIR YELLEN,They have taken steps to strengthen their financial systems and are better positioned to deal with this.
366,CHAIR YELLEN,"On the other hand, there are vulnerabilities there, and there are countries that have been badly affected by declining commodity prices, so we will monitor this very carefully."
367,CHAIR YELLEN,But we have taken care to avoid unnecessary negative spillovers.
373,CHAIR YELLEN,"So my expectation is that in a strengthening labor market that we would see faster wage growth, and I believe there is, with the 2 percent inflation objective, space for wage growth to be higher than it’s been."
374,CHAIR YELLEN,We may be seeing some incipient signs of faster wage growth.
375,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ve seen a pickup in measures of hourly compensation and some slight firming in recent months in average hourly earnings.
376,CHAIR YELLEN,I hesitate to say that this is a firm trend.
377,CHAIR YELLEN,We’ve been disappointed in the past.
378,CHAIR YELLEN,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy, but it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook."
379,CHAIR YELLEN,"It also has a bearing on assessing how much slack there is in the labor market, and I think a number of my colleagues looking at the slow pace of wage growth have—you’ve seen that their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate have come down."
380,CHAIR YELLEN,And I think that is one of the factors that has prompted those adjustments.
381,CHAIR YELLEN,"So, you know, it does affect views about just how much slack there is in the labor market and the inflation outlook."
