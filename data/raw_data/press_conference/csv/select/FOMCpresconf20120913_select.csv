0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support the recovery and employment growth.
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few moments, but I’ll first describe the economic conditions that motivated the Committee’s decision to take additional actions."
3,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy under a dual mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability."
4,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The United States has enjoyed broad price stability since the mid-1990s and continues to do so today.
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The employment situation, however, remains a grave concern."
6,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"While the economy appears to be on a path of moderate recovery, it isn’t growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate."
7,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Fewer than half of the 8 million jobs lost in the recession have been restored.
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, at 8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year and is well above normal levels."
9,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The weak job market should concern every American.
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"High unemployment imposes hardship on millions of people, and it entails a tremendous waste of human skills and talents."
11,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Five million Americans have been unemployed for more than six months, and millions more have left the labor force—many of them doubtless because they have given up on finding suitable work."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As the skills of the long-term unemployed atrophy and as their connections to the labor market wither, they may find it increasingly difficult to get good jobs, to their and their families’ cost, of course, but also to the detriment of our nation’s productive potential."
13,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"To help bolster the recovery and promote price stability, the FOMC has provided unprecedented levels of policy accommodation in recent years."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"With our main policy interest rate near its effective lower bound, we have been using two complementary tools to carry out monetary policy—balance sheet actions and forward guidance regarding how long we anticipate maintaining exceptional levels of policy accommodation."
15,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"While providing this support, we have been prudent, carefully weighing the potential benefits and costs of each new policy action, and recognizing that monetary policy, particularly in the current circumstances, cannot cure all economic ills."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The FOMC has taken several actions this year.
17,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In January, it extended its forward guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate will remain near current levels until late 2014."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In June, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year the previously established program to extend the average maturity of the securities it holds by buying longer-term securities and selling an equivalent amount of shorter-term securities."
19,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, incoming data confirm that the modest pace of growth continues to be inadequate to generate much progress on unemployment."
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"With inflation anticipated to run at or below our 2 percent objective, the Committee has become convinced that further policy accommodation is warranted to strengthen the recovery and support the gains we have begun to see in housing and other sectors."
21,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Accordingly, the FOMC decided today on new actions, electing to expand its purchases of securities and extend its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate."
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Specifically, the Committee decided to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, at a pace of $40 billion per month."
23,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The new MBS purchases—combined with the existing maturity extension program and the continued reinvestment of principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS already on our balance sheet—will result in an increase in our holdings of longer-term securities of about $85 billion each month for the remainder of the year.
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The program of MBS purchases should increase the downward pressure on long-term interest rates more generally, but also on mortgage rates, specifically, which should provide further support for the housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing."
25,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for the recovery.
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First, the Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months, and if we do not see substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, we will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ our policy tools as appropriate until we do."
27,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment.
28,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, in determining the size, pace, and composition of any additional asset purchases, we will, as always, take appropriate account of the inflation outlook and of their efficacy and costs."
29,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Additionally, the Committee emphasized that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
30,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,This should provide greater assurance to households and businesses that policy accommodation will remain even as the economy picks up.
31,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, the Committee today kept the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and stated that it anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015."
32,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants—the 7 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted their individual economic projections and policy assessments for the years 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run."
33,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8. remain somewhat above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent for this year and 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent for 2015.
35,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"While the economy appears to be advancing at a moderate pace, with some improvements appearing in housing and elsewhere, FOMC participants see an economic outlook that remains uncertain."
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The economy continues to face economic headwinds, including the situation in Europe; tight credit for some borrowers; and fiscal contraction at the federal, state, and local levels."
37,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In addition, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks."
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Before I take your questions, I’d like to briefly address three concerns that have been raised about the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy."
39,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The first is the notion that the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases are akin to fiscal spending.
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The second is that a policy of very low rates hurts savers.
41,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The third is that the Federal Reserve’s policies risk inflation down the road.
42,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the first concern, I want to emphasize that the Fed’s purchases of longer-term securities are not comparable to government spending."
43,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Federal Reserve buys financial assets, not goods and services."
44,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Ultimately, the Federal Reserve will normalize its balance sheet by selling these financial assets back into the market or by allowing them to mature."
45,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In the interim, the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its holdings of securities are remitted to the Treasury."
46,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In fact, the odds are strong that the Fed’s asset purchase programs, both through their net interest earnings and by strengthening the overall economy, will help reduce rather than increase the federal deficit and debt."
47,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the second concern, my colleagues and I are very much aware that holders of interest-bearing assets, such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns."
48,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But low interest rates also support the value of many other assets that Americans own, such as homes and businesses large and small."
49,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Indeed, in general, healthy investment returns cannot be sustained in a weak economy, and, of course, it is difficult to save for retirement or other goals without the income from a job."
50,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Thus, while low interest rates do impose some costs, Americans will ultimately benefit most from the healthy and growing economy that low interest rates help promote."
51,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And finally, on inflation: Inflation has varied in recent years with swings in global food and fuel prices caused by a range of factors, such as drought and geopolitical tensions."
52,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, overall inflation has averaged very close to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent per year for quite a few years now, and a variety of measures show that longer-term inflation expectations are quite stable."
53,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
55,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’d be happy to respond to your questions.
59,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Yes.
60,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong enough to promote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declines in unemployment.
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, that’s—we’re not going to be able to sustain purchases until we’re all the way back to full employment, that’s not the objective."
62,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The idea is to quicken the recovery, to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs and reduce the unemployment rate."
63,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s the criterion we’re looking at.
68,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we’ve been talking about our communications at the FOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public, you know, what our policy reaction function, so to speak, is."
69,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And we haven’t, to this point, come to a set of numbers, a set of data that we can put out."
70,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But what we’re trying to convey here is that we’re not going to be premature in removing policy accommodation.
71,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Even after the economy starts to recover more quickly, even after the unemployment rate begins to move down more decisively, we’re not going to rush to begin to tighten policy."
72,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re going to give it some time to make sure the recovery is well established.
78,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, our policy approach doesn’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation."
79,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s not the objective.
80,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The idea is to make sure we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time.
81,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, as we look back at the last six months or so, we’ve seen unemployment at basically the same place it was in January."
82,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment rate, and what we need to see is more progress."
83,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And that’s what we will be looking at.
84,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of the mid-2015 date, we think by that point that the economy will be recovering, we’ll be providing the support it needs."
85,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But if you look at our projections, you’ll see it doesn’t involve any inflation, that we still believe that inflation is going to be close to our 2 percent target."
88,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach."
89,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We bring inflation back to the target over time, but we do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our objectives, you know, from their targets."
95,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, our assessment—I talked about this at my remarks at Jackson Hole—our assessment, and that of the research literature, is that the policies that we’ve undertaken have had real benefits for the economy—that they have provided some support, that they have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment."
96,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"All that being said, monetary policy, as I’ve said many times, is not a panacea."
97,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s not by itself able to solve these problems.
98,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re looking for policymakers in other areas to do their part.
99,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ll do our part, and we’ll try to make sure that unemployment moves in the right direction, but we can’t solve this problem by ourselves."
101,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, what happens is going to depend on where the economy goes—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy."
102,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The 0.4 percent you’re referring to is the change in the forecast between the last projection and this one.
103,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But remember, people make projections assuming that policy is appropriate."
104,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So some of them may have assumed these policies in their last projections, and not all are assuming these policies in this projection."
105,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s probably a little bit of an understatement of what we think we can get.
106,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But in any case, again, I want to be clear that while I think we can make a meaningful and significant contribution to this problem—to reducing this problem, we can’t solve it."
107,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We don’t have tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem.
112,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the ultimate effect is going to depend, of course, on how much we end up doing, and that, in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does."
113,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,This is a conditional program; we’re going to be providing accommodation according to how the economy evolves.
114,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think that’s the virtue of putting it this way, is that if the economy is weaker, we’ll provide more support; if the economy strengthens on its own or other headwinds die down, then it will require less support."
115,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So the amount of support we provide is going to depend on how the economy evolves.
116,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We do think that these policies can bring interest rates down—not just Treasury rates, but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds and other types of important interest rates."
117,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It also affects stock prices.
118,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It affects other asset prices—home prices, for example."
119,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So looking at all the different channels of effect, we think it does have impact on the economy."
120,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It will have impact on the labor market, but, as again, the way I would describe it is a meaningful effect, a significant effect, but not a panacea, not a solution for the whole issue."
121,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re just trying to get the economy moving in the right direction, to make sure that we don’t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we’re making progress towards more acceptable levels of unemployment."
127,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, there’s a variety of possibilities, and we continue to look at all different options."
128,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But the two primary types of tools, as I’ve discussed, are balance sheet actions—and, of course, we can restructure those, change those in various ways; the other type of tool is communication tools."
129,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we could—we continue to work on how best to communicate with the public and how best to assure the public that the Fed will remain accommodative long enough to ensure recovery.
130,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, working with our communications tools, clarifying our response to economic conditions, might be one way in which we could further provide accommodation."
135,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well we are—this is a Main Street policy, because what we’re about here is trying to get jobs going."
136,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We are trying to create more employment, we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that’s the objective."
137,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Our tools involve—I mean, the tools we have involve affecting financial asset prices, and that’s—those are the tools of monetary policy."
138,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There are a number of different channels—mortgage rates, I mentioned other interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like, for example, the prices of homes."
139,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"To the extent that home prices begin to rise, consumers will feel wealthier, they’ll feel more disposed to spend."
140,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If house prices are rising, people may be more willing to buy homes because they think that they’ll, you know, make a better return on that purchase."
141,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So house prices is one vehicle.
142,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Stock prices—many people own stocks directly or indirectly.
143,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The issue here is whether or not improving asset prices generally will make people more willing to spend.
144,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there’s not enough people coming and demanding their products."
145,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And if people feel that their financial situation is better because their 401(k) looks better or for whatever reason, their house is worth more, they are more willing to go out and spend, and that’s going to provide the demand that firms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest."
160,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we—the problem is that, for this purpose, that what we’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions."
161,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We want to see the unemployment rate come down, but that’s not the only indicator, obviously, of labor market conditions."
162,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The unemployment rate came down last month because participation fell.
163,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s not necessarily a sign of improvement.
164,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we want to see more jobs.
165,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We want to see lower unemployment.
166,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be sustained; it’s not just a one-month or two-month phenomenon.
167,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re not going to be looking for little wiggles in the numbers that are going to cause us to radically shift our policy.
168,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we, at least at this point, have decided to define it qualitatively."
169,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I hope I am giving you at least a little color in terms of what we’ll be looking for.
170,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ll be looking for, again, an economy which is quickening, that gives signs of continued improvement, that allows labor markets to be stronger, and that will be the type of qualitative criteria that we look at."
171,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We don’t—again, we don’t have a single number that captures that, but we anticipate that we’ll have to do more, and we’ll do enough to make sure that the economy gets on the right track."
177,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, now you’re talking about congressional programs, and I don’t, you know, I don’t advocate specific programs."
178,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s up to them to make those decisions.
179,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think we’re seeing modest improvement in mortgage markets.
180,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,One thing that’s helping is a stronger housing market.
181,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,One reason that lenders have been very constrained is they are worried about further house price declines that will make the collateral worth less than the loan.
182,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger, lending standards have eased just a bit."
183,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There’s also been other changes which are useful.
184,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I note, for example, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks so that banks will have more certainty about under what conditions a mortgage will be put back to them if it defaults."
185,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think there’s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a little bit more open, and that is one factor, actually, that could make our policy more effective rather than less effective over time—if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we’re providing."
190,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the latter, when Operation Twist ends, we will be looking at the whole set of asset purchases in order to make decisions."
191,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ll be looking at the state of the economy, as we described in the statement."
193,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On conditioning, our policies have always been conditional in that we’ve always been clear that our asset purchases, for example, were reviewed periodically to see if they were still necessary, if they needed to be expanded."
194,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We did extend the maturity extension program, for example, when we thought that more support was needed for the economy, so our policies have always had a significant element of conditionality."
195,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But the idea here is to make that more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what’s needed to provide the support for the economy."
196,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And we hope that what that will do is provide a bit more assurance, maybe a bit more confidence, that the Fed will be there to do what it can."
197,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, we’re not promising, you know, a cure to all these ills."
198,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But what we can do is provide some support, and by assuring the public that we will be prepared to take action if the economy falters, we’re hopeful that that will increase confidence and make people more willing to invest, hire, and spend."
207,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, on the former, I’m—I have a lot to do."
208,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I am very focused on my work, and I don’t have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans."
209,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the politics, we have tried very, very hard—and I think we’ve been successful—at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical."
210,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We make our decisions based entirely on the state of the economy and the needs of the economy for policy accommodation.
211,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we just don’t take those factors into account, and we think that’s the best way to maintain our independence and maintain the trust of the public."
216,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Certainly.
217,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We are very interested in and very focused on community banks at the Fed.
218,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We believe they play a very important role in our economy and in our communities.
219,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We have a number of ways of communicating with community banks.
220,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It includes our advisory council made up of community bankers.
221,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It includes a special set of programs we have to reach out and talk to community bankers.
222,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we are very interested in their views.
223,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I speak regularly to conventions and the like and talk to various groups.
224,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of Basel III, of course, it’s not one-size-fits-all."
225,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Many—and, indeed, many of the most difficult, complex regulations apply only to the largest and most complex institutions—for example, the capital surcharge that the largest banks have to hold, the complex rules applying to trading books and derivatives, the extra supervision under section 165, the orderly liquidation authority, the liquidity rules—the whole range of things that apply only to the largest, most complex, and internationally active banks."
226,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For the smaller banks, what our proposed rule does is try to strengthen their capital, and many small banks will already meet those capital requirements."
227,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Smalls banks tend to be very well capitalized.
228,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, of course, it’s important for small banks to be well capitalized as well as large banks."
229,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And there’s a leverage requirement.
230,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, most of the rules, most of the—particularly the most complex rules in Basel III will not apply to the smaller banks."
231,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Indeed, banks under $500 million have special exemptions from these rules."
232,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Having said all of that, I remind you that what we have now is a proposed rule, and we’re receiving comment on that."
233,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have a subcommittee of our supervision committee with two experienced—one community banker, one community bank supervisor on it from our Board who are particularly interested in making sure that the rules are not excessively onerous, and we will be looking at the comments and trying to make sure that we take into account the needs of community banks when we put out the final rule."
240,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, as you know, we are living in a very complex time and dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues, including new policies that haven’t been used in the same way in the past, and so naturally we have a range of views, a range of opinions."
241,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think on the whole that’s probably a good thing.
242,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It’s good to hear different points of view, and it’s good to make sure that the points of view that are outside the Fed are reflected in the discussion around the table inside the Fed."
243,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we have a very collaborative and collegial discussion process, that, again—that spans a range of views."
244,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We were, however, able to come to a pretty good consensus—as you know, the vote on this was 11 to 1—and that’s a sign that the broad center of the Committee does support these actions and will continue to support them going forward."
247,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There’s going to be negative commentary whether it comes from Fed officials or not.
248,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, because there’s a range of views—some people think it’s more effective than others."
249,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I discussed some of the evidence in my speech in Jackson Hole, and I talked about the fact that, you know, different researchers have gotten different estimates of the impact."
250,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Virtually all of them find that there is some beneficial impact, but they disagree on how much."
251,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, there’s going to be disagreement."
252,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And again, I personally don’t think that it’s a panacea, I personally don’t think it’s going to solve the problem."
253,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I do think it has enough force to help nudge the economy in the right direction.
258,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well there’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be taken, and I can’t really prescribe all those possible responses."
259,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would focus, I think, on the fiscal side."
260,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We currently have the so-called fiscal cliff.
261,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If no action is taken, there’s going to be a very substantial increase in taxes and cut in spending on January 1 of the coming year."
262,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The CBO has suggested that if that’s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to begin to rise, and it might throw the economy back into recession."
263,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think one very basic thing that could be done to help address the recovery—the weakness of the recovery and the need for more employment—would be to address the fiscal cliff while simultaneously addressing longer-term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious."
264,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that’s one area where there is a lot of potential benefit.
265,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If the fiscal cliff isn’t addressed, as I’ve said, I don’t think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock, so we’d have to think about what to do in that contingency."
266,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think it’s really important for the fiscal policymakers to, you know, work together and try to find a solution for that."
275,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what’s normal in a recovery, which is, given that the economy fell very quickly and there’s a lot of unused capacity, there’s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be a period where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack that was created."
276,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we don’t anticipate the economy is going to be overheating anytime soon.
277,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the economy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target."
278,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On your second question, certainly, there is a range of views on how effective these tools are."
279,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’ve spent a lot of time, as all of my colleagues have, looking at the evidence, and, of course, the staff here have done a great deal of work on the question."
280,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the bottom line for most of it, most of the research, is that while these tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem, they are at least able to provide meaningful support to the economy."
281,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability."
282,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So if we have tools that we think can provide some assistance and we’re not meeting our mandate, then I think that our obligation is to do what we can."
283,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, we would like to see policies across the board to help address these issues."
284,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, you know, that’s not our province; we are the monetary policy authorities, and our job is to use monetary policy as effectively as we can."
289,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, that’s an important question."
290,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Michael Woodford— who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well, and I know his works quite well—I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward guidance—communication about future policy—is, in fact, the most powerful tool that central banks have when the interest rate is close to zero."
291,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And he advocates policies like nominal GDP targeting, for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years, the implication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP and promise to do that for many years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy."
292,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So his own perspective is that credibility is the key tool that central banks have in order to get traction at the zero lower bound.
293,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Whether we have the credibility to persuade markets that we’ll follow through is an empirical question.
294,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the evidence, which I also, again, discussed in my remarks recently, is that when we’ve announced extended guidance, that financial markets have responded to that, that private-sector forecasters have changed their estimates of what unemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation."
295,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So the empirical evidence is that our announcements do have considerable credibility.
296,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think there’s a good reason for that, which is that we have talked a lot both publicly and privately about the rationale for maintaining rates low even as the economy strengthens, and I think the basic ideas are broadly espoused within the Committee."
297,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so there is a consensus that even as the personnel change and so on going forward, that this is the appropriate approach, and that by following through, we will have created a reserve of credibility that we can use in any subsequent episodes that occur."
302,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, again, as I mentioned before, it’s true that our mortgage-backed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward pressure on mortgage rates, and create more demand for homes and more refinancing."
303,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it will depend, again, ultimately on several things."
304,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One will be on the amount that we do, the amount of purchases that we do, and that in turn is going to be a function of how the economy evolves."
305,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If the economy is weaker, we’ll do more, and in those cases, probably rates would be pretty low at any case because the economy is looking weak."
306,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If the economy is stronger, strong enough to create improving labor market conditions, we won’t have to do as much."
307,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, the amount that we do depends on how the economy evolves."
308,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, since I don’t know exactly how much we’ll end up doing, it’s a little bit hard to give you an exact estimate."
309,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think that’s, you know, in terms of how many homes and those kinds of questions, again, I think that the markets are looking—are looking a little better."
310,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think that house prices are beginning to rise in some markets, which will encourage people to look at homes, will encourage lenders to make more mortgage loans."
311,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I’m hopeful that we’ll see continued progress in the housing market; that—that has been one of the missing pistons in the engine here.
312,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Housing is usually a big part of the recovery process.
313,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We haven’t had that nearly to the usual extent, and to the extent that we can support housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome."
316,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think there’ll be some, but you get more benefit when people buy homes."
317,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily, and we’re trying to provide more support for people who want to go out and buy homes, construct homes, and also those who want to refinance."
318,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it’s the purchases of new homes that generate the construction activity, the furnishing, all those things that help the economy grow."
323,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well I—you know, it’s pretty hard to give you a number, but I can certainly confirm that as the Reserve Bank presidents and Governors made their reports today and yesterday around the table, there was considerable discussion of uncertainty, including policy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty, and the implications of that for hiring and investment decisions."
324,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,A lot of—a lot of firms are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved.
326,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I think it is a concern.
327,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It is something that is affecting behavior now.
328,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, I don’t know—I don’t have a number, I don’t know how big that effect is, but, certainly, the sooner that can be resolved, the sooner it can be clarified, it will be beneficial not just because we avoid the cliff itself, but because we clarify for firms, for employers and investors, how that’s going to be resolved."
329,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I think it’s an issue that is of some consequence, yes."
334,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, we take the economy as we find it."
335,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There are a lot of headwinds right now that are affecting the economy.
336,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There’s fiscal headwinds.
337,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s international factors, including the situation in Europe."
338,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s factors arising from still-impaired credit markets, and so on."
339,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we looked at that—looked at the economy from the perspective of, you know, how quickly it’s been growing over the last six months to a year."
340,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, as I talked about in a speech in March, in order for employment gains to be sustained, for unemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels."
341,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And lately it’s not really been at trend.
342,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’ve been responding to that problem and trying to take steps that will assure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope, will help bring unemployment down over time."
343,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, again, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty about the fiscal cliff, is one of the factors, one of the headwinds, but I’m sure there are many others, and we don’t try to differentiate among them in any sense."
344,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If the fiscal cliff does occur, I suspect it won’t, and I hope it won’t, but if it does, and we get the kind of impact the Congressional Budget Office is talking about, as I’ve said, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that, and we would have to rethink at that point."
345,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But we’ve taken the steps we’ve taken now because we’d like to see the economy gather more momentum, and the more momentum it has, the better placed we are to deal with any shocks that might come down the road."
349,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, you are absolutely right."
350,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation."
351,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Some decline in participation is anticipated, is as expected."
352,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re an aging society.
353,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We have more people retiring.
354,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Female participation has flattened out; it hasn’t continued to climb as it did for several decades.
355,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re seeing less participation among younger people, fewer college students taking part-time jobs and the like."
356,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So part of this decline in participation was something that we anticipated quite a long time ago, but part of it is cyclical."
357,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Part of it reflects the fact that some people—because they have essentially given up or at least are very discouraged—have decided to leave the labor force.
358,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And the anticipation is that if the economy really were to strengthen, and labor markets were to strengthen, at least some of those people would come back into the labor force."
359,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,They might even temporarily raise the unemployment rate because they’re now looking again.
360,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So the participation rate over and above—the decline in participation rate over and above the downward trend is just one of the other indicators of a generally weak labor market.
361,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And it’s why I said earlier that we do want to look at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate, although that’s a very important indicator, not just payrolls, although that also is a leading indicator, but participation, hours, part-time work, and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite weak condition."
362,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
