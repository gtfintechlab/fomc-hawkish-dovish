0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As always, my colleagues and I reviewed recent economic and financial developments and discussed the economic outlook."
3,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The data since our January meeting have been generally consistent with our expectation that the fourth-quarter pause in the recovery would prove temporary and that moderate economic growth would resume.
4,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Spending by households and businesses has continued to expand, and the housing sector has seen further gains."
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The jobs market has also shown signs of improvement over the past six months or so: Private payrolls are growing more quickly, total hours of work have increased, the rate of filings of new claims for unemployment insurance has fallen, and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down."
6,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated."
7,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The Committee also remains concerned that restrictive fiscal policies may slow economic growth and job creation in coming months.
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We continue to monitor the recent increases in gasoline prices, which appear to be due mostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance."
9,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Apart from temporary variations in energy prices, inflation is running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent."
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Importantly, longer-term inflation expectations remain stable."
11,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Overall, still-high unemployment, in combination with relatively low inflation, underscores the need for policies that will support progress towards maximum employment in a context of price stability."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the 7 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted individual economic projections."
13,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"March 20, 2013 As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"To summarize, the participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent in 2015."
15,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.3 to 7.5 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Most participants see inflation gradually increasing toward the Committee’s longer-run target; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.
17,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As you already know from the policy statement, we are continuing the asset purchase program first announced in September."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"This decision was supported by our review at the meeting of the likely efficacy, costs, and risks of additional purchases."
19,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Let me briefly summarize the cost–benefit analysis supporting our decision.
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Although estimates of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases—by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates—continue to provide meaningful support to economic growth and job creation."
21,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"However, most also agreed that this monetary tool would likely not be able on its own to fully offset major economic headwinds, such as those that might arise from significant near-term fiscal restraint or from a sharp increase in global financial stresses."
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We also had a thorough discussion of possible costs and risks of continued expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
23,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The risks include possible adverse implications of additional purchases for the functioning of securities markets, and the potential effects—under various scenarios—of a larger balance sheet on the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its asset holdings and, hence, on its remittances to the Treasury."
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Committee also considered possible March 20, 2013 risks to financial stability, such as might arise if persistently low rates lead some market Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL participants to take on excessive risk in a “reach for yield.” In the Committee’s view, these costs remain manageable but will continue to be monitored, and we will take them into appropriate account as we determine the size, pace, and composition of our asset purchases."
25,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As for today, our policy decision had two main elements."
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"First, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
27,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It bears emphasizing that the Committee has described this program in terms of a monthly pace of purchases, rather than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tied the evolution of the program to economic criteria—specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
28,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Within this framework, the Committee could vary the pace of purchases as progress is made toward its economic objectives or if its assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes."
29,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"At this meeting, the Committee judged that no adjustment was warranted."
30,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Second, the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and reaffirmed its expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
31,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, we anticipate that this exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
32,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I should note, as I have on other occasions, that the economic conditions provided in this forward guidance are thresholds, not triggers."
33,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Crossing one or more of these thresholds will not lead automatically to an increase in rates.
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Rather, the Committee will assess at that time whether the outlook justifies raising its target for the federal funds rate."
35,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"This guidance will help market participants assess how the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is likely to respond to economic developments, but its broader purpose is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up."
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In their individual projections, 14 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate as occurring in 2015 or 2016."
37,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Let me comment briefly on how the two main pieces of our policy accommodation—asset purchases and guidance about future changes in the federal funds rate—fit together.
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The purpose of the asset purchases is to increase the economy’s near-term momentum, with the goal of improving the outlook for the labor market and helping to promote a self-sustaining recovery with price stability."
39,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The forward rate guidance, in turn, provides information about when the Committee will begin considering the removal of policy accommodation through increases in the target for the federal funds rate."
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Importantly, the Committee expects a considerable interval to pass between the time when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset purchases and the time when it will be appropriate to begin removing accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels."
41,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As always, in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
42,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In sum, the Committee anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household and business spending and a strengthening housing sector."
43,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The labor market has shown signs of March 20, 2013 improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
44,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Inflation is Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL expected to remain low, and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive."
45,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In light of its outlook, and following a review of the efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, the Committee today reaffirmed its asset purchase program and its federal funds guidance."
46,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you very much.
47,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I would be glad to take your questions.
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, to take your second question first, the lack of thresholds comes from the complexity of the problem."
55,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the one hand, we have benefits, which are associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects on financial stability, which are hard to quantify and which people have different views about."
56,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, to this point, we’ve not been able to give quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target."
57,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward.
58,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the flow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we’re providing given the outlook for the labor market."
59,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we’ve not given quantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds."
60,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would say that we’ll be looking for sustained March 20, 2013 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including, obviously, payrolls, Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on."
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of indicators, and in a way that’s taking place throughout the economy."
62,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And since we’re looking at the outlook—we’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market— we’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there’s sufficient momentum in the economy to provide demand for labor going forward.
63,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So that will allow us to look through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short-term shocks or problems."
68,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that it’s all or nothing."
69,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We maintain full speed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you know, we stop."
70,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That would be, I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate."
71,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We think it makes more sense to have our policy variable, which is the rate of flow of purchases, respond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook."
72,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as we make progress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly."
73,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, we won’t do that every meeting; we won’t do that frequently."
74,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation March 20, 2013 consistent with the outlook, and, secondly, to help provide the markets with some sense of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL progress—how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments."
76,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by “substantial improvement,” it’s a broad-based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and labor demand."
77,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as we move—we see partial improvements, see modest improvement, as we see a period in which the labor market is doing better, and we have reason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point."
78,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But it works in both directions.
79,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If, subsequently, the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to get worse, we could, of course, bring back accommodation back to the previous level."
87,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, that’s going to be obviously a decision that the Committee has to make, and we will—at each meeting, we’ll look at progress that’s been made since the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to determine whether there’s been a sufficient change to warrant a change in our policy stance."
88,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Internally, we’ll use models and other indicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow."
89,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior, to let them see how we respond to changes in the outlook."
90,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And that way there will be a better ability, I March 20, 2013 hope, for the markets to anticipate either a return to higher levels of purchases or the ultimate Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL phasing-out of the program."
92,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That’s an issue for—obviously, there has been improvement, let me say that."
93,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’ve seen improvement in the last four or five months.
94,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The last five months, for example, we’ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector."
95,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Unemployment rate has come down four-tenths since September.
96,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Unemployment claims, insurance claims are at the lowest level they’ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing improvement."
97,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think one thing we would need is to make sure that this is not a temporary improvement.
98,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we’ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple of months, and then things weakened again."
105,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, first, on the reverberations, it’s a difficult situation in Cyprus."
106,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You’ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of the size of the March 20, 2013 economy."
107,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, in the financial sense, it’s bigger than it is in a GDP sense."
108,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And it’s a Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL difficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues.
109,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And you’ve seen that there’s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they’re going to meet the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.
110,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, there are a lot of uncertainties and difficulties, and there’s questions about how—the way Cyprus is treated, what implications that might have for other countries and the like."
111,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, it does have some consequence."
112,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, having said that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today, and I don’t think that the impact has been enormous."
113,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, I think it’s something we’re paying attention to."
114,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We hope that the Europeans will come up with an efficient and equitable solution.
115,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We are monitoring very carefully, but, at this point, we’re not seeing a major risk to the U.S. financial system or the U.S. economy."
116,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the benefits of being too big to fail, no, we don’t have an estimate."
117,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s pretty difficult to control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy.
118,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think there is some evidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institutions will fail."
119,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You see, for example, spreads in the credit default swaps that indicate some probability of failure."
120,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You see some discrimination among different institutions according to the bond market—interest rates that they get charged, and so on."
121,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there is some evidence of market discrimination.
122,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, I certainly never meant to say to Senator Warren—and I share her concern about too-big-to-fail, I think it’s a major issue—I never meant to imply that the problem was solved and gone."
123,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It is not solved and gone; it’s still here, but there’s a lot of work in train."
124,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re putting in the Basel capital standards.
125,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re putting in the orderly liquidation authority from Dodd–Frank.
126,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re working with our international partners.
127,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I hope that we’ll make March 20, 2013 progress against too-big-to-fail, because I agree with her 100 percent that it’s a real problem and Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL needs to be addressed if at all possible."
136,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, on the latter question, I don’t have anything for you."
137,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal and other publications if I come to some decision or some developments in that front.
138,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of term limits, I don’t have a strong view on that."
139,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Different countries use different approaches.
140,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Of course, the President always has the option to reappoint or not reappoint Fed Chairmen, and the Senate always has the option of confirming or not confirming."
141,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, in that respect, term limits are redundant."
142,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed Chairman, that would be, I think, the only office in the federal government besides President and Vice President that would have that restriction."
143,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But that being said, again, I don’t view this as a major issue, nor have I seen it actively discussed in, I think, in the Hill."
144,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Perhaps I missed it.
145,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I don’t have a strong view about that.
146,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"My 10-year term, of course, is not as Chairman."
147,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"My 10-year remaining term is as a Governor, so that’s not relevant, really, to the question that you asked about."
154,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Pretty recently.
155,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I have a relative that is unemployed.
156,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.
157,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent."
158,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think it’s better now.
159,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The home that I was raised in had just been foreclosed upon when I was visiting there.
160,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I have great concern about the unemployed both for their own sake, but also because the loss of skills, the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy."
161,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It reduces tax revenues.
162,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It reduces productivity.
163,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So I think it’s very, very important that we act to address unemployment, and I think the Federal Reserve—I think most people would agree—the Federal Reserve has been fairly active in that regard."
164,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of costs, there are a number of different costs, and I mentioned some of them in my remarks."
165,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think one that has recently been discussed—Governor Stein brought it up in a speech—is the issue of financial stability.
166,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Clearly, financial instability, if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious, would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs, and a threat to production."
167,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we’re not unnecessarily encouraging excessive risk-taking or other problems in the financial markets."
168,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We do address that through a number of means, including monitoring the financial system, regulation, supervision, communication, and the like."
169,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But this is a potential concern that a March 20, 2013 number of my colleagues are worried about, and it’s one of the things we talked about in our Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies."
171,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t know what you mean by “on the table.” BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
173,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, again, I don’t—we’ve not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give."
174,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And part of the concern is—is that as we go forward, we—you know, we’ll have to factor in the efficacy, which is another issue."
175,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, there’s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the economy."
176,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as we move forward in time, we’ll be learning about how effective the policy is, and what costs and risks there may be associated with it."
177,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, as we do that, perhaps we will be able to give more-explicit guidance."
178,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more effective if we could give numerical guidance.
179,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has come a long way."
180,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You know, in 1994, we didn’t even tell people when we changed the federal funds rate."
181,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, we’re telling you when—you know, what the state of the economy is going to be when we raise the federal funds rate."
182,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, we are making progress in terms of forward guidance."
187,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing too-big-to-fail."
188,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet, will be surcharges on the largest banks—that is, the largest financial institutions will have to hold more capital as a percent of their risk-weighted assets than smaller banks do."
189,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That will increase their cost of funding and, to some extent, will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and make them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited."
190,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I think that’s an important step.
191,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And there are many other restrictions in both Dodd–Frank and Basel, including liquidity restrictions and so on, that apply most strictly to the largest institutions."
192,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short-term uninsured funding does present some risks."
193,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And there are different ways to address that.
194,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But one way to address it is through liquidity regulation.
195,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And both in our 165–166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing, the limits on how much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take."
196,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, I don’t think too-big-to-fail is solved now."
197,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re doing a number of things, which I think will help."
198,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We need to keep assessing that, and we’ll be able to tell by looking at market indicators, by doing our own stress tests and the like."
199,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And if we don’t, you know, if we don’t achieve the goal, I think we’ll have to do additional steps."
200,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It is important.
201,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, it’s not something we can just forget about."
202,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It may take some time, but too-big-to-fail was a major part of the source of the crisis."
203,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don’t address that problem successfully.
207,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets—I mean, our sense is that it’s gone too far."
208,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I mean, some tightening was obviously needed."
209,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There were people who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn’t sustain a mortgage.
210,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, terms and conditions have been tightened up, and we’re now seeing much higher credit quality requirements on potential borrowers."
211,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We are concerned that a variety of factors, such as concerns about putbacks the banks may have, uncertainties about regulation—which we’re working on to get done as quickly as possible—may have tightened the mortgage credit box more than would be desirable in a long-run healthy economy."
212,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That does have some effect on monetary policy.
213,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and stimulating homebuying, construction, and related industries."
214,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So that is an issue that we take into account.
215,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I would say one thing, which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up."
216,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes, they become more creditworthy."
217,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, to some extent, not—I don’t want to overstate it—but to some extent, monetary policy—by strengthening the housing market, helping support house prices—is bringing more people into the mortgage market."
229,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,That’s right.
230,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re not targeting asset prices.
231,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re not measuring success in terms of the stock market.
232,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re measuring success in terms of our mandate, which is employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve."
233,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We do monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate."
234,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It includes the stock market and other asset markets.
235,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We use a variety of metrics.
236,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I don’t want to, now, be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it."
237,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, in the stock market, you know, we don’t see at this point anything that’s out of line with historical patterns."
238,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In particular, you should remember, of course, that while the Dow may be hitting a high, it’s in nominal terms, it’s not in real terms."
239,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And if you adjust for inflation and for the growth of the economy, you know, we’re still some distance from the high."
240,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I don’t think it’s all that surprising that the stock market would rise, given that there has been increased optimism about the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high."
241,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Profit increases have been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly unusual at this point."
247,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress."
248,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures, including the fiscal cliff deal, the sequester, and other cuts, that federal fiscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant."
249,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, that is an issue for us."
250,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We—you know, we take as given what the fiscal authorities are doing."
251,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The economy is weaker.
252,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Job creation is slower than it would be otherwise.
253,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is."
254,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fiscal restraint of that magnitude, and so the final outcome will be worse—or, in terms of jobs—than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint."
255,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I want to emphasize that I do believe that long-term fiscal stability is extremely important.
256,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I urge Congress and the Administration, as I always do, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going forward."
257,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, in doing so, I think it’s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term on what is still not a completely satisfactory recovery."
263,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, if in fact that happens, it’s an issue, obviously."
264,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s been some disconnect, at least in the short run, between unemployment rate changes and March 20, 2013 growth during this recovery, and there’ve been periods, at least, where unemployment has fallen Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited."
265,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So we’re just going to have to monitor developments in the economy and see what happens.
266,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,You’re right that we’re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.
267,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But it is also true, as you—I think, you noted, that our projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were in September when we first announced this asset purchase program."
268,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So there has been some improvement in the outlook, as measured by that metric."
269,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But you’re right.
270,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"You know, we do need to see a sustained improvement."
271,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One month, two months doesn’t cut it."
272,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, normally, you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that."
273,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we’re just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see—you know, see how things evolve."
274,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,VICTORIA McGRANE.
275,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Hi, Chairman."
276,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Victoria McGrane with the Dow Jones Newswires.
277,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In the stress test that the Fed recently conducted, there were an adverse scenario and a severely adverse scenario, and you published results of the—from the individual banks on—under the adverse—severely adverse scenario."
278,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Right.
279,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,VICTORIA McGRANE.
280,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But you didn’t under the merely adverse scenario, which featured an inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short-term rates."
281,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I have a two-part question."
284,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, the reason for publishing the severely adverse scenario, of course, is that’s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently March 20, 2013 capitalized."
285,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Presumably, if they can survive a severely adverse scenario, then an adverse Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL scenario would—obviously less strenuous, less stressful, and they wouldn’t have as much difficulty."
286,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse scenario is the right one."
287,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, I don’t see any principle reason why we couldn’t provide that information."
288,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I will find out at some point why we are doing it that way.
289,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The severely adverse scenario is mostly just a scaling-up of the adverse scenario, for the most part."
290,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There are some differences.
291,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time."
292,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, again, I think the severely adverse scenario is the one that really puts them to the test."
293,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But we’re always talking about, you know, what information will be useful to investors and to the press."
298,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, as you point out, we’re at the zero lower bound, and that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict, and March 20, 2013 with more side effects that are difficult to predict."
299,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I’m not sure I understand the whole thrust of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL your question.
300,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We have—as you know, we have given this guideline for—so we call them signposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time."
301,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, as a lot of academic research shows, you know, when you’re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you’re going to keep rates low for a significant period, that’s one way to get longer-term rates down and to provide more stimulus to the economy."
302,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we think this has been a pretty effective tool.
303,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Now, we could go further."
304,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We could lower even further, say, the unemployment rate number that we hit."
305,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’ve discussed variants, and at least one member of the Committee has suggested that."
306,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approximate the—what’s called the optimal control path of interest rates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that’s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have."
307,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It doesn’t mean we’re satisfied.
308,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It just means that we don’t have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.
309,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t know if that was responsive or not.
311,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I see.
312,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So you’re talking about the inflation target, basically."
315,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Yes, okay."
316,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero—we define price stability as March 20, 2013 banks around the world."
317,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And one might ask, “Well, price stability should be zero inflation."
319,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And so, historical experience has suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of inflation and the cost that you’re referring to."
320,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We haven’t contemplated changing that.
321,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We just put that number in, as you know, fairly recently."
322,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think at this point, it’s still being debated in academic circles that—you know, and we’ll see what kind of outcome they come up with."
323,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But it’s an interesting question to try to quantify.
325,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And our belief a few years ago was that it was a very rare event, and now it’s become more common."
326,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I’m sure there’ll be a lot of thinking about this in academic and other circles.
333,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t think I know the answer to that question.
334,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Certainly, the financial system has—I could argue two ways."
335,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I could say, well, the U.S. economy grew pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980."
336,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And the financial system was much simpler and didn’t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on.
337,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So that would be—that would be one way to argue that maybe, you know, all of this extra financial activity is not justified."
338,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the other hand, the world is a lot more complicated."
339,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re a lot—the world is a lot more international.
340,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"March 20, 2013 You have large multinational firms that are connecting resources, savers, and investors in Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL different countries."
341,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on."
342,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created in lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be somewhat bigger."
343,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I don’t really know the answer to that question.
344,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker’s claim that the only contribution to the financial industry is the automatic teller machine might be a little exaggerated.
345,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I know that people—some people have that view.
346,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Again, I don’t know the answer."
347,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and the more globalized financial economic system that we have.
348,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But the exact number, I can’t really say."
353,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I don’t necessarily know all the details, and so I know they’re grappling with a very difficult problem."
354,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think the issue they face is that there’s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense that there is a fiscal issue and there’s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue."
355,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, they’re looking for resources where they can find them."
356,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I think everyone understands that there are certain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower-income people.
357,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,There is the issue of setting a precedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods.
358,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But again, that being said, it’s a very tough issue."
359,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I—and finding the resources to solve Cyprus’s March 20, 2013 problem, you know, there’s probably no easy way to do it."
360,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And we’re going to keep monitoring Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that.
361,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I don’t envy them that particular challenge.
366,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, you’re absolutely right that there’s been a certain tendency for a spring slump that we’ve seen a few times."
367,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"One possible explanation for that—besides some freaky things, some weather events and so on, one possible explanation is seasonality."
368,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted."
369,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And they may have led—and I say “may” because the statistical experts—many of them deny it, but it’s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the year."
370,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we’re far enough away from the recession that those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now."
371,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So if we do, in fact, see a slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes and then we would obviously have to respond to that."
372,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"As I said, we’re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the outlook, and that can go either direction."
376,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy, and I don’t think that these issues, as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for March 20, 2013 the Cypriote people, I don’t think that they have direct implications for the U.S. economy."
377,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL only way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some sense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence."
378,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But at this point, I’m not aware of any evidence that that is, in fact, the case."
379,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"The argument the Europeans are making is that Cyprus is a very unique situation, very different situation."
380,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to their economy."
381,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In terms of the United States, you know, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, and insured deposits, and they’re very proud of the fact that no one’s ever lost a dime in insured deposits."
382,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, during the crisis, the response of the government was, in fact, to increase the level of, you know, depositor account sizes that were insured."
383,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States.
387,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the first question, as I said, I mean that’s a decision for the Committee."
388,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"We’re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement is, how sustained it is."
389,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Long-term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment problem.
390,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,But I think that probably the best way to get the long-term unemployed back to work is to get an overall strong labor market.
391,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And I think that’s—we’d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned."
392,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,The other part of your question was about— DON LEE.
393,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Labor force.
394,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Labor force participation, yes."
395,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Labor force participation has been declining on a trend-like basis in the United States for a while.
396,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That’s the result, mostly, of demographic factors, partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female participation is no longer increasing—it’s in fact decreasing a little bit."
397,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It’s also the case that labor force attachment within people of working age has declined for a number of different reasons.
398,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,So there’s a trend underlying this.
399,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And, in addition, there are probably some people who’ve left the labor force just because they are discouraged and they can’t find work."
400,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as the economy strengthens, the labor market strengthens, I would expect to see some of these folks coming back into the labor force."
401,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"For example, the number of people who are out of the labor force but say they would like a full-time job but are not actually counted as unemployed, that number has actually been going up, which suggests that there are more people thinking about going back into the labor force, going back to work."
402,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I doubt that, in the near term at least, that we’ll see an increase in labor force participation because—besides the effects of the slow recovery, high unemployment, we’ve had a downward trend in the U.S., which is not due to the recession, it’s due to underlying demographic factors."
407,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Well, I still believe the following, which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument."
408,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, you might, at the same time, be throwing the economy into recession, which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy."
409,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And therefore, I think the first March 20, 2013 line of defense—I mean, I think, we have a sort of a tripartite line of defense."
410,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We start off with Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL very extensive and sophisticated monitoring at a much higher level and much more comprehensively than we’ve had in the past.
411,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"Then we have supervision and regulation, where we work with other agencies to try to cover all the empty or uncovered areas in the financial system."
412,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to affect the way that financial markets respond to monetary policy."
413,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So we do have some first lines of defense, which I think should be used first."
414,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ve had—not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years—that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy."
415,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,And I think most of the people on the FOMC would agree with that.
416,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,What that means exactly depends on the circumstances.
417,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low for that purpose, it’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you’re concerned about some sector in the financial sphere."
418,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"On the other hand, if you’re in an expansion and there’s a credit boom going on, that—the case in that situation for making policy a little bit tighter might be better."
419,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"So, as I’ve said many times, I have an open mind in this question."
420,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,We’re learning; all central bankers are learning.
421,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But I think I still would agree with the point I made in my very first speech in 2002, as a Governor at the Federal Reserve, where I argued that the first line of defense ought to be the more targeted tools that we have, including regulatory tools and, to some extent, macroprudential tools like some emerging markets use."
427,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"I’ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don’t have any—I don’t really have any information for you at this juncture."
428,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,I don’t think that I’m the only person in the world who can manage the exit.
429,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"In fact, one of the things that I hope to accomplish, and was not entirely successful at, as the Governor or as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was to try to depersonalize, to some extent, monetary policy and financial policy and to get broader recognition of the fact that this is an extraordinary institution."
430,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,It has a large number of very high quality policymakers.
431,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"It has a terrific staff—literally dozens of Ph.D. economists who’ve been working through the crisis, trying to understand these issues and implement our policy tools, and there’s no single person who is essential to that."
432,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,"But, again, with respect to my personal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete."
433,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE,Thank you.
