0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome."
1,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.
2,CHAIR POWELL,We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices.
3,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.
4,CHAIR POWELL,Today we decided to lower interest rates.
5,CHAIR POWELL,"As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks."
6,CHAIR POWELL,The U.S. economy has continued to perform well.
7,CHAIR POWELL,"We are into the 11th year of this economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable."
8,CHAIR POWELL,The economy grew at a 2½ percent pace in the first half of the year.
9,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending—supported by a strong job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence—has been the key driver of growth."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output."
11,CHAIR POWELL,The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments—two sources of uncertainty that we’ve been monitoring all year.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened, notably in Europe and China."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports."
15,CHAIR POWELL,Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses.
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Business fixed investment posted a modest decline in the second quarter, and recent indicators point to continued softness."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer-run value."
19,CHAIR POWELL,The job market remains strong.
20,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half, and job gains have remained solid in recent months."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"The pace of job gains has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace."
22,CHAIR POWELL,Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing.
23,CHAIR POWELL,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
24,CHAIR POWELL,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.
25,CHAIR POWELL,"This underscores, for us, the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind."
26,CHAIR POWELL,We expect the job market to remain strong.
27,CHAIR POWELL,The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.
28,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months through July, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1 However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges."
31,CHAIR POWELL,We are mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer-term inflation expectations.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 objective as most likely."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate, and this shift has supported the outlook."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, this is the role of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"Today’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent, to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed has no role in the formulation of trade policy, but we do take into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals."
41,CHAIR POWELL,The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.
42,CHAIR POWELL,"We have often said that policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"As I have noted, the baseline economic outlook remains positive."
44,CHAIR POWELL,The projections of appropriate policy show that participants generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years.
45,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, those views are merely forecasts and, as always, will evolve with the arrival of new information."
46,CHAIR POWELL,Let me say a few words about our monetary policy operations.
47,CHAIR POWELL,"Funding pressures in money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top September 18, 2019 of its target range yesterday."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"While these issues are important for market functioning and market Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy."
49,CHAIR POWELL,This upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities.
50,CHAIR POWELL,"To counter these pressures, we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"These temporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range."
52,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, as we have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate."
53,CHAIR POWELL,"In a related action, we also adjusted the rate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range."
54,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.
55,CHAIR POWELL,"Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required."
56,CHAIR POWELL,"To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
57,CHAIR POWELL,"As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
58,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
59,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll be happy to take your questions.
60,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL MARTIN CRUTSINGER."
61,CHAIR POWELL,Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.
63,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective."
64,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters."
65,CHAIR POWELL,"As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in, I guess, 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate."
69,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see that—it’s not what we expect—but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don’t actually have that practice anymore, so I can’t really adopt it right here."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, I’ll respond to your question."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So we did—we made one decision today, and September 18, 2019 that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"We believe that action is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate to promote our objectives, of course."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to be highly data dependent, as always."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we’re not on a preset course."
81,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we’re going to look at it.
82,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to be carefully looking at economic data.
83,CHAIR POWELL,Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting, at the full range of information, and we’re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, what we do going forward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve seen—you know, if you look at the things we’re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade developments, global growth has continued to weaken."
90,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s weakened since our last meeting.
91,CHAIR POWELL,"Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess—or back up, perhaps—over the course of this intermeeting period."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, they’ve been quite volatile."
93,CHAIR POWELL,So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now.
94,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to be watching that carefully.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re also going to be watching the U.S. data quite carefully, and we’ll have to make an assessment as we go."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you’re right."
102,CHAIR POWELL,"Sometimes the—and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction is relatively clear and it’s relatively easy to reach unanimity."
103,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"And I really do think that’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives, really."
108,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
109,CHAIR POWELL,So I’ll try to get at that this way.
110,CHAIR POWELL,"I think that the idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can—I think that’s a good idea in principle, and I think history teaches us that it’s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can."
111,CHAIR POWELL,I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.
112,CHAIR POWELL,"So I told you where the Committee—the bulk of the Committee is going, meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a Committee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, September 18, 2019 consistently, through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has felt that it’s Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again."
114,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think you’ve seen us being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture, and I have no reason to think that will change."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend—data includes the evolving risk picture."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s where I am, and that’s where I think the bulk of the Committee is."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the—you know, the behavior of these markets."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, we were well aware of the—you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we were very much waiting for that."
130,CHAIR POWELL,But we didn’t expect—the response to that was stronger than we expected.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"It wasn’t a surprise, but it was—it was a stronger response September 18, 2019 than—certainly than we expected."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"So, no, I’m not concerned about that, to answer your Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL question."
135,CHAIR POWELL,I can go on a little bit about how we’re looking at that.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, it doesn’t—we don’t see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates."
138,CHAIR POWELL,"The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated—strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes."
139,CHAIR POWELL,"We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures."
141,CHAIR POWELL,We will not hesitate to use them.
142,CHAIR POWELL,"And since we’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this."
143,CHAIR POWELL,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime."
144,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ve been operating in that regime for a full decade.
145,CHAIR POWELL,We think it works well to implement our rate decisions.
146,CHAIR POWELL,The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates—the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.
147,CHAIR POWELL,It’s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"So, going forward, we’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet."
149,CHAIR POWELL,And I’m sure we’ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting.
150,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL STEVE LIESMAN."
154,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s something we’ve tried to be very clear about.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"And as you know, we’ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess their—what they say is their demand for reserves."
156,CHAIR POWELL,We try to assess what that is.
157,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve tried to combine all of that together.
158,CHAIR POWELL,We put it out so the public can react to it.
159,CHAIR POWELL,"But, yes, there’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, we’ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting."
167,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
168,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time."
169,CHAIR POWELL,It’s generally of very high quality.
170,CHAIR POWELL,It’s their research.
171,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System.
172,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just—and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it—their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession."
173,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a great tradition that we have.
174,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is, it went after measuring trade September 18, 2019 policy uncertainty through a couple of channels, including concerning tariffs, also concerning the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"And while I would say, directly answering your question, there’s real uncertainty around these—around these effects."
176,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a $22 trillion economy.
177,CHAIR POWELL,"To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and this piece of research found significant effects, and that’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken."
179,CHAIR POWELL,It’s also consistent with what we’ve been hearing in the Beige Book.
180,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I mean, I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"You see it in weak business investment, weak exports—hard to quantify it precisely, though."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, honestly, I think it’s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the closer you get to the current day, the more confidence you can have."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"But even then, knowing where the—knowing what the September 18, 2019 data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there’s a lot of uncertainty around that."
197,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, well, I think, if you look at the U.S.—look at the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy has generally performed roughly as expected—roughly: The consumer is spending at a healthy clip, I’d say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I’d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market is still strong, though, so generally that is the same."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"I think if you look at—the global economy, I think, has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that intermeeting period."
200,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s why I think what’s—that’s what’s happened over the intermeeting period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think it’s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, for the foreseeable future, we’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days—these temporary open market operations."
209,CHAIR POWELL,That will be the tool that we use.
211,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.
218,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that’s not something that we think right now."
220,CHAIR POWELL,"On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to supply them."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"In September 18, 2019 terms of the net stable funding ratio, it’s—I believe we put it out for comment and got Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL comments, and I believe we’re looking at—at finalizing that in the relatively near future."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we want banks to, you know—to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule."
229,CHAIR POWELL,"So my point, really, was that—to start, that trade policy is not the business of the Fed, it’s the business of Congress and the Administration."
231,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can, in principle, be something that monetary policy should take into consideration."
232,CHAIR POWELL,And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that’s weighing on the outlook.
233,CHAIR POWELL,"So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can’t address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade."
234,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t do that.
235,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t have that tool.
236,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness, to some extent, by supporting demand through sound monetary policy."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels: by reducing interest September 18, 2019 burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables, of homes, and other interest-sensitive Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL items; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses; and also by boosting household and business confidence."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I don’t want to be heard to say that our tools don’t have an effect."
239,CHAIR POWELL,They do.
240,CHAIR POWELL,But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can’t address.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think, yeah."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s a challenge."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s no simple bottom-line answer where I can say, yes, I’ve got it for you here."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"But what it amounts to is this: What you see is probably the kind of volatility that’s typical of an important, complex, ongoing negotiation."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate."
247,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements.
248,CHAIR POWELL,We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.
249,CHAIR POWELL,So we need to look through what’s a pretty volatile situation.
250,CHAIR POWELL,So that means not overreacting quickly.
251,CHAIR POWELL,"It means not underreacting, too."
252,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really what we’re trying to do.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we’ve felt."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, to some extent, I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable."
262,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
263,CHAIR POWELL,"So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events, we’ll be looking at global growth, we’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"Most importantly, we’ll be looking at the performance of the U.S. economy."
265,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stable prices."
266,CHAIR POWELL,So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals.
267,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s an unusual situation, because, you know, the U.S. economy itself—the largest part of it, the consumer part of it—is in strong shape."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"The manufacturing part, less so."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"But, overall, you see an economy that—I think, generally, forecasts show growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year."
270,CHAIR POWELL,"So the difference here is, we have significant, really, risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events, but also from slowing global growth and trade policy uncertainty."
271,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"I can’t—it’s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things."
273,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not on a preset course.
274,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and, you know, we’ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentioned earlier, is, it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then—so there’s a fair amount of research that would show that that’s the case."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand."
284,CHAIR POWELL,What we believe we’re facing here—what we think we’re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.
285,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case."
286,CHAIR POWELL,"If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we’re prepared to be aggressive, and we’ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate."
287,CHAIR POWELL,You mentioned negative interest rates.
288,CHAIR POWELL,So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.
289,CHAIR POWELL,"We chose to—after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively."
290,CHAIR POWELL,We feel that they worked fairly well.
291,CHAIR POWELL,We did not use negative rates.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not something we are expecting—then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance."
293,CHAIR POWELL,I do not think we’d be looking at using negative rates.
294,CHAIR POWELL,I just don’t think those will be at the top of our list.
295,CHAIR POWELL,"By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we’re looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework—the strategy, tools, and communications—and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL DON LEE."
297,CHAIR POWELL,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
300,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we think monetary policy works with, as Friedman said, long and variable lags."
301,CHAIR POWELL,So I think the real effects will be felt over time.
302,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers, so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that—cars—it supports purchases of those."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions—higher asset prices."
304,CHAIR POWELL,That’s—the models and the data show that that’s another powerful channel.
305,CHAIR POWELL,I also think there’s a confidence channel.
306,CHAIR POWELL,You see—you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.
307,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"It isn’t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we’re going to use the tool we have."
309,CHAIR POWELL,"And if it comes to it, we’ll use all of our tools."
310,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how we think it works and how we think it’s working.
312,CHAIR POWELL,It’s very hard to say.
313,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—you know, it’s tough to say."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll—we’ll use our tools to offset negative—that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so, if you look at—if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape."
318,CHAIR POWELL,They’re less levered.
319,CHAIR POWELL,They’ve got less debt.
320,CHAIR POWELL,They’ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.
321,CHAIR POWELL,And they’re in very good shape—much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.
322,CHAIR POWELL,So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.
323,CHAIR POWELL,"That doesn’t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but, overall, it’s really not a concern."
324,CHAIR POWELL,"The business sector is something that, you know, we’ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"However, so is the size of the business sector."
326,CHAIR POWELL,"So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that’s the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren’t downturns for, now, into our 11th year."
328,CHAIR POWELL,"You get—you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s something we’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down."
331,CHAIR POWELL,It’s more of—it’s more of an amplifier.
332,CHAIR POWELL,"We take it very seriously, though, and, you know, we’re monitoring it carefully."
333,CHAIR POWELL,We’re actually looking—the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world.
334,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we’re trying to keep on top of it."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"September 18, 2019 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL GREG ROBB."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
337,CHAIR POWELL,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
338,CHAIR POWELL,I’m kind of hearing two things from you.
339,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re saying that the economy is doing well, but there’s this sense with people that the economy is actually starting to slow now."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"And people are—more and more, you talk—there’s talk about recession, so you—and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so, I think—and my colleagues and I, I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that’s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the issue is more the risks to that."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"You have downside risks here, and we’ve talked about them."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time— less so than for many other economies, but, still, there’s a sector of our economy that’s exposed to that."
347,CHAIR POWELL,Trade policy uncertainty also has—apparently has an effect.
348,CHAIR POWELL,So—and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless—so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to ensure against those downside risks, but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re not—as I mentioned, we’re not—we don’t see a recession."
351,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not forecasting a recession.
352,CHAIR POWELL,"But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is, in fact, a favorable outlook."
375,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it’s really just going to be when we think we’ve done enough."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our eyes are open."
377,CHAIR POWELL,We’re watching the situation.
378,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve cut rates twice.
379,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve moved, really, through the course of this year, as I discussed, and, you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching—this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’t been reached in a long time."
381,CHAIR POWELL,"There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that’s all."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we’re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we’ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively."
383,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know.
384,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to be watching things carefully.
385,CHAIR POWELL,The incoming data and the evolving situation and—that’s what’s going to guide our—guide us on that path.
386,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it’s very high."
387,CHAIR POWELL,We’re very unified.
388,CHAIR POWELL,We feel like we’re doing the best job we can in serving the American people.
393,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so I saw the headline, like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this morning’s meeting."
394,CHAIR POWELL,I really don’t have anything for you on that.
395,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image of the institution."
396,CHAIR POWELL,I have no idea whether that’s what happened at Bank of America.
397,CHAIR POWELL,"I really don’t know, standing here today."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we try to be clear about that, but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know, to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices."
404,CHAIR POWELL,That’s our real job.
405,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of giving the fiscal authorities—who, by the way, are the ones who created us—advice about how to do their job, you know, we keep that at a high level, I think."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force September 18, 2019 participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"All of that comes from the private sector, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the long run, we can’t really affect the growth rate of the United States."
409,CHAIR POWELL,The potential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy.
410,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a function of other things.
411,CHAIR POWELL,"So I—I try to be clear about that, and so—but, ultimately, fiscal—fiscal authorities will do what they seem—deem appropriate."
415,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t.
416,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not going to change my practice here today of not responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials.
417,CHAIR POWELL,I will just say that I continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time.
418,CHAIR POWELL,And I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that’s what I have to say on it."
426,CHAIR POWELL,"Not really, no."
427,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s really—that’s really Treasury’s job and Congress’s job, in terms of, well, there’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are, and then there’s how to finance it."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from the Fed."
429,CHAIR POWELL,We take—we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work.
430,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that doesn’t stop us, from time to time, from saying that we think it’s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it’s not."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s been the case for a long time, and that’s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is strong."
432,CHAIR POWELL,So we limit ourselves to high-level statements like that.
436,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, so I guess I would say it this way."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"Global capital markets are highly integrated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad."
438,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this: that low rates abroad are a symbol—or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that has implications for us."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we—in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that."
442,CHAIR POWELL,"And so I think we put all—all of that goes into our thinking and into our September 18, 2019 models."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"We do understand how the—you know, how the international sector interfaces with the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL U.S. economy."
444,CHAIR POWELL,We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.
445,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
