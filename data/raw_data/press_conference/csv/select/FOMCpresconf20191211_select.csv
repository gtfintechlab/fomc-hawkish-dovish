0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, everyone."
1,CHAIR POWELL,"To begin, I’d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know, passed away earlier this week."
2,CHAIR POWELL,Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987.
3,CHAIR POWELL,He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, he’s best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today."
5,CHAIR POWELL,But what is perhaps most admirable about him—more than his many accomplishments—was his character.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’s share of his life to it."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans."
8,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example.
9,CHAIR POWELL,"Turning to today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous three meetings."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth December 11, 2019 abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, the overall Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL economy has been growing moderately."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"And with a strong household sector and supportive monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
23,CHAIR POWELL,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.
24,CHAIR POWELL,Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education.
25,CHAIR POWELL,These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
26,CHAIR POWELL,We expect the job market to remain strong.
27,CHAIR POWELL,The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.
28,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent, and core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation—was 1.6 percent."
30,CHAIR POWELL,"While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes December 11, 2019 for American families and businesses."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent."
34,CHAIR POWELL,The median of participants’ projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2021.
35,CHAIR POWELL,We’re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year, as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point."
40,CHAIR POWELL,This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track.
41,CHAIR POWELL,"The medians of participants’ projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, that is the function of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, if December 11, 2019 developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL accordingly."
47,CHAIR POWELL,Policy is not on a preset course.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Finally, I wanted to note that we’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1 These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy."
49,CHAIR POWELL,Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.
50,CHAIR POWELL,"To address possible pressures in money markets over the year-end, we’ve been conducting term repo operations spanning year-end."
51,CHAIR POWELL,We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.
52,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
58,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years."
59,CHAIR POWELL,"If you go back 50 years, you would have seen that, when there was—when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up."
60,CHAIR POWELL,"And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there’s still a connection, but it’s—it’s a very faint one."
61,CHAIR POWELL,And I—what that suggests is that you 1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.
62,CHAIR POWELL,"December 11, 2019 would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative."
63,CHAIR POWELL,"And we believe that policy is somewhat Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL accommodative, and we think that that’s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t think that’s right."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak."
68,CHAIR POWELL,The coefficient is something like 0.1.
69,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s much, much lower than it used to be, but I don’t know that it’s gone down any more in the last decade."
70,CHAIR POWELL,It just is quite faint.
71,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s still there.
72,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, you can see it."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around 2 percent."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3½ percent, and that suggests tightening."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"The same thing is true, but much less true, of inflation, the relationship between—in a way, the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do still see some relationship, and that’s what you’re seeing in those numbers."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"So there’s similarities, conceptual similarities, I think, between the two instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates."
83,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s the same situation we believe we’re in here.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"That wasn’t in the plan, you know, in any kind of specific way at the beginning."
86,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the same.
87,CHAIR POWELL,"What’s different is, you have a very different—you have very different structural characteristics in the economy, particularly around inflation."
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So now, as you can see, inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there."
89,CHAIR POWELL,So the need for rate increases is less.
90,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, this is—it’s a good thing that, you know, we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent."
92,CHAIR POWELL,It’s quite different in ’95 and ’98 when there were those two adjustments.
93,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I would say, similarities and differences."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’m going to take a little step back, and I will—I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills."
102,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications.
103,CHAIR POWELL,"We’d decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate—the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves."
104,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"And the purpose of all this, let’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short-term rates."
106,CHAIR POWELL,"We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them."
107,CHAIR POWELL,"The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility, particularly in the repo market."
108,CHAIR POWELL,"So, taking you back, this—as you know, we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"And yet we saw, actually, in September that reserves—the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"So what had happened was that liquidity, which actually existed, didn’t flow into the repo market, and that had effects on the federal funds rate."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"December 11, 2019 And we’ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened."
114,CHAIR POWELL,"There Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL are—there are payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised—we’re looking carefully at those."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don’t undermine safety and soundness, and a number of ideas are under—under examination there."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off, really, on September 17 with overnight operations."
117,CHAIR POWELL,By October 11 we had created and put into effect a plan.
118,CHAIR POWELL,That plan is in effect.
119,CHAIR POWELL,It’s working.
120,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short-term rates are stable, markets are functioning."
121,CHAIR POWELL,So you asked about year-end.
122,CHAIR POWELL,Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end.
123,CHAIR POWELL,And our—both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.
124,CHAIR POWELL,"We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"Our strategy has been—essentially, the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through—through both overnight and term repo, and, at the same time, we’re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases."
126,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll take that now.
127,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve said bills—bill purchases.
128,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy.
129,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not at this place, but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short-term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if—if the need arises."
130,CHAIR POWELL,So—but we don’t—we don’t—we’re not in that place.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"It looks—it very much looks like the bill—so those bill purchases are going well, just according to expectations."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, the other thing I’ll say is that we’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll be December 11, 2019 providing—we’ll be continuing that, and we’re prepared to adjust our tactics."
134,CHAIR POWELL,We’re—we’re Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL focused on—on year-end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate.
136,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on the standing repo facility, as you know, we’ve actually had a couple of meetings where we’ve discussed that."
137,CHAIR POWELL,I think the standing repo facility is something that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"At the moment what we’re focused on is, you know—we’re now focused on year-end."
139,CHAIR POWELL,"I should also mention that after the year-end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases, as that happens, there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t know—we can’t know today what the timing of that will be, but that’s the way—that’s the way we see it going over time."
145,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our—with our outlook."
146,CHAIR POWELL,"And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns."
147,CHAIR POWELL,That’s my view.
150,CHAIR POWELL,"We haven’t—we haven’t tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance."
151,CHAIR POWELL,It happens to be my view that that’s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation.
156,CHAIR POWELL,"I think what you’re seeing is, you’ve got a full year of the median being flat, which is, we think, accommodative, modestly accommodative, and inflation not moving up very much, as we’ve discussed."
157,CHAIR POWELL,"And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent, for—ever since I arrived in 2012."
159,CHAIR POWELL,"And it hasn’t happened, and it’s just—it’s because there are disinflationary forces around the world, and they’ve been stronger than, I think, people understood them to be."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of those out-year rate increases, what’s you’re—you’re looking at rate increases more than a year into the future, and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we—really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that, over time, it would be appropriate—if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent, it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can’t see this at this level of detail, but—today—but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate—under appropriate policy."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, it’s just that there is still, empirically, by many, many different—by the work of many different analysts, there is a relationship between resource utilization, by which I mean unemployment, and inflation."
166,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just relatively weak.
167,CHAIR POWELL,"And, by the way, that’s not a bad thing."
168,CHAIR POWELL,That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.
169,CHAIR POWELL,"It also means, though, that it’s not easy to move inflation up."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I would say there’s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point."
172,CHAIR POWELL,It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.
173,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look around the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn’t quite been able to achieve it."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s—it’s a real challenge, and—but I think we’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I—you know, I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is “no.” And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome, and that’s what we’re trying to do."
182,CHAIR POWELL,"And so the—the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board, and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy."
183,CHAIR POWELL,"Ultimately, it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight."
184,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.
185,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I did see the news today that it appears there’s an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA, and, of course, it’s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say, though, that getting—if the deal were to be enacted, then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy December 11, 2019 uncertainty, and that would be, I believe, a positive for the economy."
192,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’ll say the same thing Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL about the negotiations with China, which haven’t reached that point yet."
193,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they’ve been telling us all year—for a year and a half, really, that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"And I do think that, again, without commenting on it—in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think that uncertainty—removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well."
206,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
207,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategies, tools, and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"And you’re right, though, that we’ve talked here a lot about inflation."
209,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that the—I think, more broadly, over a period of years—many years—we’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower."
210,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed, but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation."
212,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market.
213,CHAIR POWELL,"I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those, the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think you—you get a perspective, which—you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such."
216,CHAIR POWELL,But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review.
217,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that the fact that these communities have so much—such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.
218,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive, and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"You also see from December 11, 2019 the business perspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to—you know, to look Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL through things on people’s résumés that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot—there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I—I think we have kind of internalized—and this isn’t—this isn’t news for today, this is something we’ve been saying for, you know, for several years—you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the—of maximum employment."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"And—and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that are relatively low."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we know that, and I think the review certainly underscores that, but that’s—that’s a very important insight."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we’ve done a ton of work on that."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve talked to supervisors, and—it’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’re all over the place on the composition of their—of their buffer."
235,CHAIR POWELL,"So you have to have—you have a business model, and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be, and that suggests what your buffer should be."
236,CHAIR POWELL,And you see them making quite different choices.
237,CHAIR POWELL,"Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer Treasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so it’s not obvious that there’s one thing happening there."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"Notwithstanding that, we have—we’ve gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors."
239,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the—the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet; we’ve taken it as exogenous."
240,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know that at some point we won’t have those discussions, but, you know, Treasury—we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs."
241,CHAIR POWELL,And then we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our—to our work.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, there may come a time when we—when we talk about that, but we haven’t done much of that."
245,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think there is some of that, though—and so we’re working hard and fast."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"But those are things, you know, the—if they take rule changes, it’ll take, you December 11, 2019 know, a notice of public rulemaking—it’ll take three months and things like that."
247,CHAIR POWELL,Those things Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL take time.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"These things that we’re working on now, though—like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are—those are things we have to do right now and are doing."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, we did, actually—if you look at the statement, you’ll notice that we—we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement."
256,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, those are the things that we’ve been monitoring all year."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things, so we’re not revisiting that."
258,CHAIR POWELL,"But those are—those are just key things, and they haven’t gone away, so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there—still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I mean, one thing that we’re mindful of is that we’ve cut rates three times since July."
265,CHAIR POWELL,That’s 75 basis points’ worth of cuts.
266,CHAIR POWELL,"And we do believe that monetary December 11, 2019 policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL of those actions are seen in the economy."
267,CHAIR POWELL,So that’ll take some time.
268,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s one reason to hold back and—and wait.
269,CHAIR POWELL,And we thought—I think we took strong measures.
270,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, if you look at—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points."
271,CHAIR POWELL,So you’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of what’s—you know, what is material at the end of the day, well, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgment of the FOMC."
273,CHAIR POWELL,There isn’t any single factor that will determine our decisions.
274,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll—we’ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"So I—this wouldn’t be a—my response will not be about Paul Volcker, but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"So, if you look back at 2018—I’ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"We had an economy growing at 3 percent, we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of stimulus arriving, and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent."
281,CHAIR POWELL,So it wasn’t that—so we moved—we moved policy up during the course of the year.
282,CHAIR POWELL,We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time.
283,CHAIR POWELL,So there was no sense of it being restrictive.
284,CHAIR POWELL,"We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing."
285,CHAIR POWELL,It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight.
286,CHAIR POWELL,"The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—we December 11, 2019 were really just trying to get near neutral."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"And even with the last rate increase a year ago, we Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL were still meaningfully below the median estimate on the Committee of what the neutral rate was."
288,CHAIR POWELL,So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.
289,CHAIR POWELL,"I think what’s happened is, the—obviously, the facts on the ground have changed."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you’ve seen a continual weakening."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"Just look at the IMF’s forecasts of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now."
292,CHAIR POWELL,You’ve had quite a significant—that does affect us.
293,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of ’18, and I think it had—has had—you know, I think there’ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect, but I think it’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent, through—through, you know, the tariff effects."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, that’s not to make a judgment."
295,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not up to us to make a judgment about that.
296,CHAIR POWELL,"So, that’s what—that would be my story."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate on—on a hypothetical."
300,CHAIR POWELL,I would say—we’ll just have to see.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re—we look at a range of factors and we’ve—as I’ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations."
302,CHAIR POWELL,We try not to react.
303,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t react.
304,CHAIR POWELL,"Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth as this has December 11, 2019 happened, as is probably typical of a—of a large complex negotiation."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in terms of—you Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL know, I—again, I don’t want to get into hypothetical outcomes, though, if that’s all right."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I—I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors’ longtime practice of not discussing private meetings with elected officials—or other officials, really."
309,CHAIR POWELL,But thank you.
314,CHAIR POWELL,No.
315,CHAIR POWELL,We have not.
316,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t consider things like that.
319,CHAIR POWELL,"With—I think properly understood, it can be useful, but that’s been a challenge."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think “properly understood” to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn’t."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy."
322,CHAIR POWELL,"Remember that we write all that down, and we send it in, and it gets compiled."
323,CHAIR POWELL,"But we don’t discuss it at the meeting, and we don’t negotiate a plan."
324,CHAIR POWELL,There is no—there’s no agreement.
325,CHAIR POWELL,There’s no plan.
326,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, particularly at inflection points, it’s hard to convey the reality, which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are—they’re just not a consideration."
328,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"And if the fact—dots that we did six months ago or three months ago don’t agree with that, that’s not even in the conversation."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"So its more—but it can it be useful if—and I think—but, as I said, it’s been a challenge, and so I—I do—I do like to say, if you focus too much on the dots, you can—you can miss the broader picture."
337,CHAIR POWELL,No.
338,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say, we’re—we’ve been working on this all year."
339,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re just at the stage where we’ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.
340,CHAIR POWELL,"At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy."
341,CHAIR POWELL,So we had a—we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research.
342,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re just getting to the stage where we’re looking at conclusions.
344,CHAIR POWELL,"And those things—many of those things would wind up as changes, if you will, modifications to the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” I think that process will take until the middle December 11, 2019 of the year where—but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"And that is— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL in effect, that is our framework document."
346,CHAIR POWELL,And I wouldn’t prejudge.
347,CHAIR POWELL,No one—I believe we will be able to—to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.
348,CHAIR POWELL,I do.
349,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of “4 percent”—so that’s—I think it’s premature for people to be saying that this isn’t going anywhere.
350,CHAIR POWELL,You know—and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target.
351,CHAIR POWELL,So I’ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.
354,CHAIR POWELL,You haven’t been able to get it to 2.
355,CHAIR POWELL,So I think we—I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.
359,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think it’s a fair question."
360,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I think—I’d like for this review to come out with very—a set of positive results—you know, meaningful improvements."
361,CHAIR POWELL,It doesn’t mean it has to solve every problem going forward.
362,CHAIR POWELL,We want to—we want to have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.
363,CHAIR POWELL,"These things don’t tend to move in—you know, in a lurchy way, they tend to evolve."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think—and if we do this, then in a few years, again and again and things like that, then we can—at least we’re moving in a good direction."
365,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we will be.
366,CHAIR POWELL,I’m confident we will be.
370,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, you know, I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year—you know, thinking about what’s the economy December 11, 2019 going to be doing."
371,CHAIR POWELL,"I like where we are on policy, as I mentioned."
372,CHAIR POWELL,I think our policy stance is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this.
373,CHAIR POWELL,"You know—I mean, it’s too long of a question."
374,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t know how to get after that."
375,CHAIR POWELL,There’s—there’s a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs.
376,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re always going to be trying to learn lessons."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, wage gains have moved up a bit."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look back three, four years, you’ll see wages are growing around 2 percent."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3½ percent."
393,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s a couple of things.
394,CHAIR POWELL,I think there are a range of explanations.
395,CHAIR POWELL,"For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low."
396,CHAIR POWELL,So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.
397,CHAIR POWELL,"Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages."
398,CHAIR POWELL,"I also think there are other December 11, 2019 possible potential explanations, such as, you know, globalization can be—the idea that you can Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"I think that hangs over the wage-setting process—and everywhere, pretty much."
400,CHAIR POWELL,You don’t see—there isn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think there—there are many, many possible explanations."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say, though, if you look, for example, at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are—their wages are going up at 3.7 percent."
404,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, you do see—and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the—that’s been true for the last couple of years—lower end of the wage spectrum."
405,CHAIR POWELL,So you do see wages moving up.
406,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just—they’re not moving up at—at very high rates.
407,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, yes."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"People were writing down numbers in the fives, and then they were writing down numbers in the fours."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half, and we still see wage inflation, as you mentioned."
414,CHAIR POWELL,"The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers."
415,CHAIR POWELL,"But you wouldn’t—that shouldn’t have much of an effect, actually."
417,CHAIR POWELL,It may just be that there’s more slack in the economy.
418,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we are seeing that.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re December 11, 2019 seeing—really, it showed up through higher participation."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"For many years, we’ve thought that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL there’s a trend decline in participation."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"Notwithstanding that, against that trend, we’ve seen prime-age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years."
422,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we think the CRA—we know the CRA is a very important law, and we’re strongly committed to the mission of ensuring that banks provide credit to their—throughout their communities, particularly addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and neighborhoods."
429,CHAIR POWELL,We also think it’s time for modernization.
430,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve thought that for some time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC, really, on—on a proposal."
431,CHAIR POWELL,And my hope is that we can still do that.
432,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I don’t know whether that’ll be possible or not."
433,CHAIR POWELL,"It will have to—well, we’ll just have to see, but—and if we—if we can’t, I don’t—I’m not sure what the path forward would be."
434,CHAIR POWELL,"We would certainly not want to create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes."
435,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s something we—I hope we don’t have to face, but we will if we have to."
442,CHAIR POWELL,"Really, wages."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we—there’s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is—I like to say the labor market is strong."
444,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t really want to say that it’s tight.
445,CHAIR POWELL,Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market—that was in the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings.
446,CHAIR POWELL,So I’ll say that the labor market is strong.
447,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t know that it’s tight, because you’re not seeing wage increases, you know."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"Ultimately, if it’s tight, those should be—should be reflected in higher wage increases, so it does come down to that."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we look at countless measures of labor market—you know, labor utilization, and there’s so many—it’s too many to count."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"But the one that has—that is kind of suggesting that you’re—it’s a healthy number that, you know, the sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a decent number—3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy."
451,CHAIR POWELL,"Ultimately, though, we’d like to see—to call it “hot,” you’d want to see heat."
452,CHAIR POWELL,"You’d want to see, you know, higher wages."
453,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
