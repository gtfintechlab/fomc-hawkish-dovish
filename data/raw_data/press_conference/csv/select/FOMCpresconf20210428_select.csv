0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2,CHAIR POWELL,Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
3,CHAIR POWELL,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened."
6,CHAIR POWELL,Household spending on goods has risen robustly.
7,CHAIR POWELL,"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also increased."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Spending on services has also picked up, including at restaurants and bars."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"More generally, the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"While the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from complete."
11,CHAIR POWELL,The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"While the level of new cases remains concerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year."
14,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal as soon as possible."
15,CHAIR POWELL,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a notable gain for the second consecutive month."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6 percent in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics."
22,CHAIR POWELL,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
23,CHAIR POWELL,Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal."
29,CHAIR POWELL,Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
31,CHAIR POWELL,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
32,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
33,CHAIR POWELL,I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.
34,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
35,CHAIR POWELL,The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
36,CHAIR POWELL,"The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
37,CHAIR POWELL,Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.
38,CHAIR POWELL,This outcome-based guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
40,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
41,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
42,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
43,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
52,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
53,CHAIR POWELL,"So, no, it is not time yet."
54,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we’d do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so."
55,CHAIR POWELL,"In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progress toward our goals."
56,CHAIR POWELL,We first articulated this “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting.
57,CHAIR POWELL,Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter.
58,CHAIR POWELL,And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.
68,CHAIR POWELL,"Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus."
69,CHAIR POWELL,The economy can’t fully recover until people are confident that it’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’t come back in unless they feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will—that just won’t be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is decisively behind us."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"So for, for asset purchases, we’ve said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"For interest rates, as I—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent."
75,CHAIR POWELL,So those are our tests.
76,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t have an independent test to do with the virus.
77,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say, though, as I—as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests."
87,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it seems unlikely."
90,CHAIR POWELL,It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent.
91,CHAIR POWELL,They tend to move together.
92,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to—that would take some time."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"And you would think that, that it would be quite likely that, that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening."
94,CHAIR POWELL,"If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth."
95,CHAIR POWELL,"So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state."
105,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
106,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that I’ve just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper."
107,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it’s very likely going to be the case that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other—it, it—you know, those two things should more or less coexist."
108,CHAIR POWELL,"We haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve because we’re not—you know, we’re not experts in that area."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, we’re really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not, not necessarily fully under control."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter as well."
112,CHAIR POWELL,But we’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal—substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.
121,CHAIR POWELL,"So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of—out of the labor market for an extended period of time."
122,CHAIR POWELL,The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had.
123,CHAIR POWELL,"Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations."
125,CHAIR POWELL,That was a big concern.
126,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021."
127,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re—you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020."
131,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve got a long ways to go.
132,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, it’s going to be a different economy."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are—they’ve been looking at deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it, it may well be—it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had."
135,CHAIR POWELL,These were people who were working in February of 2020.
136,CHAIR POWELL,They clearly want to work.
137,CHAIR POWELL,So those people are going to need—they’re going to need help.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for—you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work."
139,CHAIR POWELL,"We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve with our policy."
147,CHAIR POWELL,"So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course."
148,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say that, before the pandemic, it’s a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis."
149,CHAIR POWELL,And one of the main differences was that households were in very good shape financially compared to where they were.
150,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores."
151,CHAIR POWELL,"There wasn’t the subprime—you know, low-doc, no-doc lending practices were not there."
152,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.
153,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that carefully."
154,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot of supply right now."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly."
156,CHAIR POWELL,Inventories are tremendously low.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, we’re all hearing those stories."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you’re—if you’re an entry level housing buyer, this is—this is a problem, because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house, and that’s a problem."
159,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we—it’s part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in that sense, it’s good."
161,CHAIR POWELL,It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global Financial Crisis.
162,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry."
163,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we’re watching it very carefully."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing."
166,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t—we really don’t see that here.
167,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there: the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’t find—an elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"It, it should be a number of different things."
179,CHAIR POWELL,There are workers who don’t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for.
180,CHAIR POWELL,There may be geographical differences.
181,CHAIR POWELL,"It, it may also be that, for example, there—one big factor would be, schools aren’t open yet, so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can’t be yet."
182,CHAIR POWELL,"There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are weighing on people, so some—some people don’t want to go back to work."
183,CHAIR POWELL,There are also a significant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that they’re retired.
184,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books, if you will."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but clearly there’s something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are reporting labor shortages."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see that in a real—you know, in a really tight labor market."
187,CHAIR POWELL,And we may well start to see that.
188,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, and it may be a different expansion, we don’t know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"In other words, if you were worried about there—about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, labor force participation held up."
191,CHAIR POWELL,People came in the labor force.
192,CHAIR POWELL,They stayed in the labor force longer than expected.
193,CHAIR POWELL,"So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium."
194,CHAIR POWELL,Maybe pay will go up.
195,CHAIR POWELL,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon."
196,CHAIR POWELL,"So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand."
197,CHAIR POWELL,"It may take some months, though."
212,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks for your question.
213,CHAIR POWELL,"So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question."
214,CHAIR POWELL,So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
215,CHAIR POWELL,"Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time."
217,CHAIR POWELL,"So, with a, a little bit of context, we’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why."
220,CHAIR POWELL,But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.
221,CHAIR POWELL,"In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future—inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"Indeed, it is the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring inflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say, if I may, that is a principal difference from—we’re all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and ’70s, of course."
225,CHAIR POWELL,And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.
226,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that."
227,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s—or many, many differences, actually."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term."
229,CHAIR POWELL,The first is the base effects.
230,CHAIR POWELL,Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.
231,CHAIR POWELL,That process has already started to show up.
232,CHAIR POWELL,"You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data."
233,CHAIR POWELL,These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.
234,CHAIR POWELL,"So, significant increases, and they’ll disappear over the following months."
235,CHAIR POWELL,And they’ll be transitory.
236,CHAIR POWELL,They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.
237,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s base effects.
238,CHAIR POWELL,The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks.
239,CHAIR POWELL,"So this is what we’re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries."
240,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter, too."
242,CHAIR POWELL,"A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves."
244,CHAIR POWELL,We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months.
245,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job."
247,CHAIR POWELL,We will do our job.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"And we are, we are focused—as you’ve seen, for many years, we’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent."
250,CHAIR POWELL,No one should doubt that we will do that.
251,CHAIR POWELL,This is not what we expect.
252,CHAIR POWELL,"But no one should doubt that, in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March."
264,CHAIR POWELL,We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.
265,CHAIR POWELL,And I was just suggesting that we’d want to see more like that.
266,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that doesn’t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have—we’re a long way from our, our goals."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases, we just need to make substantial further progress."
269,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going to take some time.
270,CHAIR POWELL,"On, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors."
271,CHAIR POWELL,I was really thinking—we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.
272,CHAIR POWELL,I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real effects.
273,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation."
274,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, there’s a basket for CPI or PCE."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"There are, you know, many, many, many factors that go into it."
276,CHAIR POWELL,Relative prices are always moving up and down.
277,CHAIR POWELL,"This, this—we think it’s, it’s very fair to say that the increases we see and, frankly, are about to see later this week are largely due to base effects."
278,CHAIR POWELL,"It would have been more contentious to say “entirely due to base effects” because there are some things that are always going up, and so we just said “largely.” MICHELLE SMITH."
279,CHAIR POWELL,[Inaudible] CATARINA SARAIVA.
280,CHAIR POWELL,"Hi, Chair Powell."
281,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks for taking our questions.
282,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large-scale bank supervision—has completely overhauled that approach."
283,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s even created a special committee that looks horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks.
287,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk-management systems in place so that they can spot these things."
288,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks."
289,CHAIR POWELL,"In the grand scheme of these large institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"The prime brokerage business is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms, and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"It, it—in some cases, it may be they were—it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them."
295,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what we’re looking into.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, frankly, yes."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I’ve been very busy, but I will visit."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention, because I don’t want that to be part of the story."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will—I will go visit when, when it’s no longer a, a news story."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"And I—you know, I—I’ve met with homeless people many times, a number of times, anyway, let’s say."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I think it’s always good to talk to people and hear what’s going on in their lives."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"What you find out is, they’re you."
308,CHAIR POWELL,They’re just us.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, they’re, they’re—these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, and they’ve just, they’ve just found themselves in this place."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem, though."
311,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I’m well aware that this is not something that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"But I, I will do that when, when the need arises and when, when it’s not so much, you know, in the public eye."
314,CHAIR POWELL,Not really.
315,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I, I think I know what I’ll find there."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I think you, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is, they’re like you."
317,CHAIR POWELL,That could be you.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, that could be your sister."
319,CHAIR POWELL,"That could be, you know, your kid."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"You, you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and, you know, it just is a—it’s a—it’s an important thing to engage in, I think."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think, you know, we bring that understanding into our lives and, frankly, into our work—the work that we do as well."
328,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we’re going to see some of them around the world."
331,CHAIR POWELL,And we need to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve.
333,CHAIR POWELL,"And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues."
334,CHAIR POWELL,"I am—I would say this: We’re the world’s reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency."
335,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s because of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our economy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States."
336,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s why we’re the, the reserve currency."
337,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency."
338,CHAIR POWELL,So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency.
339,CHAIR POWELL,I am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital currency first.
341,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’m not so concerned about, about that."
342,CHAIR POWELL,I am really concerned about getting it right.
343,CHAIR POWELL,"It is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system."
344,CHAIR POWELL,We have FedNow and other immediately available funds.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time."
346,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll be normal.
348,CHAIR POWELL,Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that would—that would work here."
350,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every payment that’s used—for which it is used in real time."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s much more to do with things that are happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global—you know, sort of global competition."
359,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we think of survey, market based—survey being either households or, or economists and, and market based."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation target, which calls for 2 percent average inflation."
362,CHAIR POWELL,So they’re at the low end.
363,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"And we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent basis."
365,CHAIR POWELL,We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century.
366,CHAIR POWELL,"We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent."
368,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t really see that yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way."
369,CHAIR POWELL,"Breakevens are based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re now at levels that are—that are pretty close to mandate consistent, whereas before, they were below."
370,CHAIR POWELL,"We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, as you would obviously know."
371,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is.
374,CHAIR POWELL,It doesn’t work that way.
375,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"We expect—as I mentioned, we expect core and, and headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and—you know, I—and we expect that to go away."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in."
378,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know how persistent they’ll be.
379,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we think they’ll—you know, it’s a matter of, of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through."
380,CHAIR POWELL,But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them.
381,CHAIR POWELL,"They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don’t know."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy."
383,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what’s happening.
384,CHAIR POWELL,"We had it—we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"And what’s happening is, it’s, it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and people going back to work and things like that."
386,CHAIR POWELL,The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt.
387,CHAIR POWELL,New restaurants will have to be opened.
388,CHAIR POWELL,The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.
389,CHAIR POWELL,And you—you’re seeing some of that.
390,CHAIR POWELL,"That’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"You’ll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time."
401,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
402,CHAIR POWELL,"So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a broad framework, so we don’t just jump from one thing to another."
403,CHAIR POWELL,"I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity markets, which, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets."
404,CHAIR POWELL,"But really, it—really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"You are seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy."
407,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a fact.
408,CHAIR POWELL,"I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy."
409,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.
410,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"The other—the other things, though—you know, leverage in the financial system, is it—is, is not a problem."
412,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a—that’s a—that was one of the four pillars.
413,CHAIR POWELL,Asset prices was one.
414,CHAIR POWELL,"Leverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks."
415,CHAIR POWELL,"We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low."
416,CHAIR POWELL,"We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’re not systemic right now."
417,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"It was in—it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit."
419,CHAIR POWELL,"There were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that, that the—that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically."
420,CHAIR POWELL,That hasn’t happened.
421,CHAIR POWELL,"So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re in good shape."
422,CHAIR POWELL,You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it’s—you know, it’s manageable, I would say."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s—by the way, I think it’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity."
425,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, 8½ million people who had jobs in February don’t have them now, and, you know, there’s a long way to go until we reach our goal."
426,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what I would say.
432,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
433,CHAIR POWELL,"So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at target range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine."
434,CHAIR POWELL,We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.
435,CHAIR POWELL,"We do expect further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the—in the Treasury General Account."
436,CHAIR POWELL,"But, at this point, we didn’t see a need for—to, to deploy our tools to, to support rates."
437,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise."
445,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me—went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic."
446,CHAIR POWELL,"And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three, three of our—two of our stress tests, and that is another one that’s pending."
447,CHAIR POWELL,"So capital is, is in a good place, as far as I’m concerned, in the banking system."
448,CHAIR POWELL,"But, to your point, what we saw was—so what, what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to—we’re, we’re looking at that."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make those vehicles resilient so that they don’t have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there’s, you know, severely stressed market conditions."
450,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a private business.
451,CHAIR POWELL,"They, they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others to—around the world to come in."
452,CHAIR POWELL,So that was that.
453,CHAIR POWELL,The other one is Treasury market structure.
454,CHAIR POWELL,"Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there’s so much more supply of Treasuries."
455,CHAIR POWELL,"And so there are some questions about Treasury market structure, and there’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there’s something we can do about this, because we—you know, the U.S. Treasury market is probably the most single important—single most important market in, in the economy and the world."
456,CHAIR POWELL,It needs to be liquid.
457,CHAIR POWELL,It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.
458,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s not clear what, what—where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful look—and the Treasury Department is, is really going to be leading this—at, at Treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong Treasury market that can work even in difficult times."
459,CHAIR POWELL,"As, as you know, at the very beginning of the financial—of the—of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries, including by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn’t handle the volume."
460,CHAIR POWELL,"And so what was happening was, the market was really starting to lose function, and that’s—that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases."
472,CHAIR POWELL,I’m not sure if—I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.
476,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
477,CHAIR POWELL,Sorry.
478,CHAIR POWELL,"So we have—you know, we’ve articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just, we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress."
479,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any decision."
480,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to let, you know, the, the public know that that’s what we’re thinking."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and so there’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing."
482,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s about substantial further progress toward our goals.
483,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s really all it is."
484,CHAIR POWELL,"It doesn’t have any, any external, virus-related specific requirement, although, again, I do think it’ll—you know, the, the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals."
485,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s really the economic goals.
486,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, your second question."
487,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, just say again."
488,CHAIR POWELL,I didn’t quite get that question.
491,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s really up to Congress.
492,CHAIR POWELL,We—we’re not an adviser to Congress.
493,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don’t, we don’t weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals."
494,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really between elected parties.
495,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and they get to be accountable to the voters."
496,CHAIR POWELL,"We didn’t do any of that, and we don’t have a seat at that table."
497,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t seek a seat at that table.
498,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s really something for Congress and the Administration to, to deal with."
508,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
509,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I mean, we’re—we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we’ve sort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that."
510,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not meant to provide direct assistance to, to the housing market."
511,CHAIR POWELL,That was never the intent.
512,CHAIR POWELL,It was really just to keep that as—it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.
513,CHAIR POWELL,"And so that’s, that’s why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought MBS too."
514,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was really not, not a problem this time at all."
515,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and, you know, it’s, it’s a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time."
516,CHAIR POWELL,And that time is not yet.
527,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s really not more complicated than this.
528,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we articulated the “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting."
529,CHAIR POWELL,"And, really, for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals."
530,CHAIR POWELL,"And, remember, substantial further progress from December—from our December meeting."
531,CHAIR POWELL,And then vaccination started to get more widespread.
532,CHAIR POWELL,The economy reopened.
533,CHAIR POWELL,We got a really nice job report for March.
534,CHAIR POWELL,It doesn’t constitute substantial further progress.
535,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not close to substantial further progress.
536,CHAIR POWELL,We’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal.
537,CHAIR POWELL,And we believe we will; it just is a question of when.
538,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, when that time—when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we’ll do that."
539,CHAIR POWELL,And—but that time is not now.
540,CHAIR POWELL,It’s—we’re just not—we’re not that far.
541,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve had one great jobs report.
542,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not enough.
543,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re going to act on actual data, not on our forecast."
544,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re just going to need to see more data.
545,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—it’s no, no more complicated than that."
550,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re, you’re very faint."
551,CHAIR POWELL,"So if someone has the volume, they can turn it up."
552,CHAIR POWELL,"But if we bought less, you know, no."
553,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy."
554,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial conditions."
555,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that."
556,CHAIR POWELL,"And we articulated the—you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation."
557,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think, you know—so we’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates."
558,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we’ll, we’ll go ahead."
559,CHAIR POWELL,"As we—you know, we’ve done this before."
560,CHAIR POWELL,"We did it in, in the last—after the last crisis, and, you know, we’ll do it in, in maybe—we’ll do it—as those tests are satisfied, we’ll do it."
563,CHAIR POWELL,"That will be the test for, for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates."
566,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
