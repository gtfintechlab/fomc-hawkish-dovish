And I'm pleased to have the opportunity to share with you, the students of South Dakota State University (SDSU), my experience as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and my outlook for the U.S. economy.1 Today I will speak to you about my outlook for the U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve has been doing to support economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery.
I will also touch on a few details about what I've learned of the economic conditions here in South Dakota.
Over the past few days, I've had the opportunity to meet with a number of business and community leaders here in your state.
Beginning on Monday in Rapid City, I made a quick pre-dawn visit to Mount Rushmore on Tuesday while en route to a Native American Indian reservation.
Later in the day, I met with state, business, and tribal leaders in Pierre, and here in Brookings earlier today.
Hearing directly about the successes and challenges from their perspective provides important context for understanding economic conditions that cannot be obtained from economic data.
These conversations help us see through the data from the eyes of the people, businesses, and communities that make up the American economy.
That information is very helpful to me and to us at the Federal Reserve as we make our policy decisions.
But before I turn to the outlook and its implications for Federal Reserve decisions, let me share some basics about the Fed's responsibilities and how we carry out those responsibilities.
As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.
