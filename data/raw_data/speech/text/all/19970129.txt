Paper by Mr. George, Governor, Bank of England I would like to say first that it is a pleasure for me to be here today to participate in this conference and to have the opportunity to exchange views on the important issues addressed by this session in particular.
I also want to thank Governor George for his fine survey on the question of whether banks remain special; his paper makes many good points and I agree with virtually all of what he has to say.
As a consequence, my comments will be more in the nature of expanding upon his remarks, rather than in taking issue with any of his main points.
As Governor George noted, the degree to which each of us regards banks as "special" is bound to be colored by the history and development of banking in our respective countries.
Of course, the U.S. banking is quite unique in many respects.
Relative to the U.K., for example, we have many more depositories (on the order of 25,000 or so) and they operate with more regulatory restrictions on their activities than in the U.K. and many other countries.
Also, our system of deposit insurance is more generous than in the U.K.
Bearing these differences in mind, I will attempt to address aspects of our subject today that apply more or less generically in all countries, but I will draw on U.S. experiences for illustrations.
To begin, let me say that I found the seemingly simple question "Are banks still special?"
to be deceptively difficult.
In reading Mr. George's paper and organizing my own thoughts on the subject, I was compelled to answer for myself a series of even more basic questions such as: "How do we define a 'bank'?
", "What do we mean by 'special'?
