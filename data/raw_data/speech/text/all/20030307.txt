For at least the past twenty years, the process of financial globalization has been rapidly advancing.
The development of new financial products, notably a wide variety of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and the removal of many barriers to international capital mobility have tightened linkages among global financial markets.
As a result, capital has flowed more freely across national borders in search of the highest risk-adjusted rates of return.
At some point, globalization undoubtedly will reach maturity.
Financial innovation will slow as we approach a world in which financial markets are complete in the sense that all financial risks can be efficiently transferred to those most willing to bear them.
Equivalently, as institutional and legal impediments to cross-border flows are eliminated, the bias in the allocation of savings toward local investments will be reduced to its minimum, and the opportunity for arbitrage across national markets will disappear.
In my lecture today, I will consider whether there are signs that globalization is nearing maturity.
In particular, has the pace of financial innovation begun to slow?
Do the patterns of capital flows suggest that global financial markets are approaching full integration?
And, most important, what do the answers to these questions imply regarding the potential for future contributions of globalization to economic growth and financial stability?
Has the Pace of Financial Innovation Begun to Slow?
Although the pace of innovation cannot be measured with precision, important new instruments continue to emerge.
