It is a pleasure to be here with you this evening.
I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.
You likely already know that I have fully supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decisions over the past several meetings.
Those decisions were to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in 75 basis point increments, and the federal funds rate now stands at 3 to 3-1/4 percent.
Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.
Naturally, the focus is now on what will happen at the next FOMC meeting and beyond.
At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation.
If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table.
However, if inflation starts to decline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate.
To bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time.
However, it is not yet clear how high we will need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to see inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way.
My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.
This uncertainty makes it very challenging to provide precise guidance on the path for the federal funds rate.
