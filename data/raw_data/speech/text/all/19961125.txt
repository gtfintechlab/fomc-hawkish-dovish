In your program this morning, you have already heard a lot about the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y proposal, and I will not repeat the details.
Still, I think it would be useful to highlight two of the key principles the Board identified in seeking comment on Regulation Y -- two principles that I believe illustrate a more general restructuring of the Board's overall approach to regulation and supervision.
These principles also animate the Board's recent proposals in the section 20 area and elsewhere.
First, in proposing to expand the laundry list of activities in which a bank holding company may engage, the Board stated that, to the extent possible, the restrictions a bank holding company faces in conducting a specific activity should be no more onerous than those applying to an insured depository institution conducting the same activity.
Second, in proposing to streamline the application process for bank holding company acquisitions, the Board stated that review of those applications should focus on how the proposal would affect the organization -- as opposed to serving as a vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory issues at the applicant organization.
