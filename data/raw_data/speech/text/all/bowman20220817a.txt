It's really a pleasure to be here, finally in person at the Venture Center.1 Much has happened over the past few years, and I have been following your work closely.
Technology Is Changing Financial Services Technology and innovation are a priority interest for my work at the Board of Governors.
Technology can offer increased speed, lower costs, and greater efficiency in providing services and products in the financial industry.
This week's conference agenda includes many of the topics I follow closely through our work on innovation.
Much of the innovation in financial services is occurring in the nonbank sector, but technology is also changing the business of banking in profound ways.
More and more customers interact with their banks exclusively through digital channels.
They check their balances, apply for credit cards, and make deposits and payments via their phones, rather than visiting bank branches.
But the changes run deeper than that.
Technology is also changing fundamental aspects of bank operations.
For example, banks are beginning to use artificial intelligence (AI) in credit underwriting, back-office operations, various aspects of risk management, and customer service.
Technology is also leading to new bank business models.
Many banks are using application programming interfaces and other technology to allow nonbank technology firms to provide financial services.
Under many of these arrangements, the technology firm maintains the customer relationship, while the bank provides the underlying financial infrastructure, including deposit services and access to the payment rails.
Federal Reserve Support for Innovation The Federal Reserve is monitoring these transformations closely, and we are encouraged by the potential for improvements that can be brought by responsible innovation.
