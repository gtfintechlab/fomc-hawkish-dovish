September 28, 2021 Creating a New Model for the Future of Supervision Governor Michelle W. Bowman At the Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference, St. Louis, Missouri (virtual conference) Share Watch Live Good afternoon.
I'm pleased to be able to join you again virtually for this year's Community Banking in the 21st Century research and policy conference.
Although I think we would all prefer to be together in person, in the shadow of the St. Louis Arch, I'm optimistic that next year (which will be the 10th anniversary of the conference, by the way) will give us the opportunity to finally gather in person after a two-year hiatus.
For nine years, this conference, which brings together researchers, regulators, and community bankers, has enabled us to hear from top academics around the world who conduct research to help us better understand the community bank business model.
It's not an accident that this conference is sponsored by three agencies involved in the supervision of banksâ€”the Federal Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the FDICâ€”as the work of this conference has informed, and will continue to inform, how we think about the supervision of our nation's community banks.
Our conference sponsors entered this partnership with the belief that what we learn here will deepen our understanding of the benefits of, and the challenges facing, the community bank business model, which, in turn, helps to make us better bank supervisors.
It's natural then to ask: What have we learned from this conference that is applicable today?
What might we apply in the future to the supervision of community banks?
To answer that question, or quite frankly, to answer many questions that pertain to the regulation and supervision of banks, it's instructive to first go back a bit in history.
In this case, I'd like to take you all the way back to...2019.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
Way back then, we were concerned about liquidity.
Banks were concerned about a potential run-off of deposits as consumers found new, more technology-centric ways to manage their money, often outside of the insured banking system.
Although we also saw a decline in technology costs that enabled banks of all sizes to offer a wider array of digital products and services to their customers, the innovation taking place outside the banking sector was often seen as outpacing the innovation in the banking sector.
Consumers seemed to increasingly weigh convenience over safety, as a number of non-banks increased their market share.
To a lesser degree, but still concerning, was that of the convenience factor.
It drove some small business borrowers to move away from lenders with whom they had longstanding relationships.
In some cases, those borrowers were even willing to pay much more for credit for the sake of convenience.
Unfortunately, some borrowers learned the hard way that convenience does not always outweigh a banking relationshipâ€”particularly when a business or community experiences a significant hardship such as a natural disaster.
I regularly heard stories of how small businesses that borrowed from an online lender were unable to reach anyone to discuss their situation during a crisis and ultimately had their loans called because of missing a payment.
In these situations, I also heard stories of how the local community bank that understood the local situation and wanted to see the business and the community survive, would step in, and refinance the original loan to help the small business return to more normal operations.
I also heard about challenges with core processors and how legacy contracts and a lack of competition for core processing services was stifling innovation.
We saw several fintechs become "mainstream" nationally, and we saw a proliferation of technology solutions targeted at helping community banks become nimbler in adding new products and services.
From a supervisory perspective, the Federal Reserve actively explored ways to reduce regulatory burden and provide greater transparency into the work of bank supervisors.
Using research presented in prior years at this conference, we applied findings showing the disproportionate regulatory burden borne by our smallest institutions and looked across our processes to find ways to tailor our supervisory model to more accurately reflect the risk posed by these smaller financial institutions.
And then came March 2020 and the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.
Despite the many choices consumers have for managing their money and purchases outside of the traditional banking system, we witnessed a systematic flight to the safety of FDIC-insured deposits in state or nationally chartered banks.
Specifically, total deposits at all FDIC-insured institutions increased by 22 percent when comparing deposit data from 2019 to 2020.1 Small business lending also increased significantly.
From the end of 2019 to the end of the second quarter of 2020 alone, small loans to businesses at community banks, a proxy for small business lending, increased by 39 percent.2 The Impact of the PPP during the Pandemic One driver for the increase in small business lending was, of course, the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program or PPP.
The PPP was funded by the U.S. Treasury Department through forgivable loans that enabled small businesses to maintain payroll, retain employees who may have been laid off in response to the social distancing protocols that went into effect in April 2020, or to cover other overhead costs.
To support the PPP, the Federal Reserve provided a liquidity backstop to PPP lenders through its Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF.
In recognition of the evolution in the banking landscape that I referenced a few moments ago, the PPPLF was designed to not only provide a liquidity backstop to banks and credit unions, but also to serve non-bank fintechs, community development financial institutions, and agricultural finance companies that participated in the PPP.
Given the important role minority-owned banks play in the allocation of credit in their communities, the Federal Reserve also actively engaged minority depository institutions to ensure they had the tools they needed to benefit from the Fed's emergency liquidity programs.
To be sure, the PPP and the PPPLF will provide significant research material for years to come.
I understand from reviewing the papers accepted into this year's proceedings that it has already driven the work of several economists you'll be hearing from over this two-day conference.
In reviewing the data on these programs, howeverâ€”and here I must credit the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's "Supervision Transformational Trends" programâ€”we see that a substantial majority of PPP loans, nearly 73 percent, were made by insured depository institutions.
These loans also accounted for nearly 90 percent of the aggregated loan amount for all PPP loans.
Getting a bit more granular, we can see that community banks made 32 percent of all PPP loans while large banks made 35 percent of all PPP loans, with credit unions and savings banks accounting for the rest of the loans made by banking institutions.
Fintechs accounted for approximately 13 percent of all PPP loans and more than half of those were made as a result of a partner bank relationship.
A recent working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) offers additional detail on the roles these different types of lenders played in allocating credit through the PPP during the pandemic.3 The authors found Community banks originated the majority of PPP loans when the program first launched, while large banks were the majority lender during the second phase of the program.4 Community banks provided more loans to middle income borrowers while large banks provided more PPP loans to upper income borrowers.
Community banks and large banks made loans to lower and moderate-income borrowers in approximately equal proportions.
Fintech firms, on the other hand, made more loans in zip codes with fewer bank branches, lower incomes, and larger minority populations.5 The authors also found that fintech lending, instead of taking market share from traditional banks, mostly expanded the overall supply of credit and other financial services.
From my perspective, these findings offer evidence of the continuing importance of community banks to our economy during both "normal" times as well as during times of extreme financial stress.
Or, to paraphrase Mark Twain, "reports of the demise of community banks are greatly exaggerated."
The NBER paper also highlights how new entrants to banking can meet an unmet need.
The experiences of banks and bank supervisors during the pandemic also offer insights into how we should think about the Federal Reserve's approach to supervision in the future.
