I hope that CRA does not get bogged down in a slavish devotion to implementation of regulatory minutia, or excessive focus on protests which always create an adversarial tension.
Now that CRA has gotten the attention of the bankers--and we regulators will continue to make sure the attention does not lapse, community groups should focus on solidifying partnerships and collaboration with banks at the local level.
We are at a fortunate point.
The economy is providing the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth.
CRA has helped open new markets for financial institutions, and the regulators have improved the CRA regulatory apparatus.
All this comes at a time in our history when the positive, collaborative role of community-based organizations, the private sector, and government is needed more than ever and when the serious policy action is at the community level.
