Good afternoon.
It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a topic that has become more important in a world of global financial markets--the matter of coordinating and harmonizing our national regulatory systems.
On the conference agenda, the topic was phrased as a question, that is, whether we should harmonize our systems.
In a sense, the question is somewhat moot--the globalization of the markets and the breadth of international conglomerate financial institutions is forcing us in that direction.
But I would quickly add that one definition of "harmony" is "a pleasing combination of elements."
We can sing compatible and pleasant-sounding notes, without singing the same note.
It is in that sense that I believe harmonization of our regulatory systems will develop.
In my comments this afternoon, I will mention some of the efforts underway in which the United States is working with other countries to develop more consistent supervisory and regulatory systems, particularly for large financial conglomerates.
That experience may provide others with ideas about how they might pursue similar efforts, either on a bilateral or multilateral basis.
Perhaps more importantly, though, I will also offer my views on where our interests are likely to be most similar and why and how regulators around the world are likely to continue working toward compatible or "harmonized" systems.
Let me begin with those thoughts.
The Importance of Compatible Regulatory Regimes One cannot have dealt with U.S. and world financial markets during the past few decades without being thoroughly impressed with the rapid pace of change and the manner in which technology and financial innovation have affected market practice.
