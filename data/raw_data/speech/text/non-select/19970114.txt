Central bankers, because of the continuity of our institutions and the nature of our responsibilities, typically are said to take a long-term view.
By that, I mean we try to look beyond the current calendar quarter to the next year or maybe even a few years beyond.
Standing here in this university, which was founded more than 500 years ago and had already become a leading university in Europe by the 16th century, gives a meaningful perspective to what central bankers consider the longer term.
Today, I shall address the various roles of a central bank encompassing: bank supervision, the provision of financial services, and, of course, monetary policy.
I recognize that not all central banks are the same, and in particular that the central bank's role in bank supervision varies considerably from one country to another.
However, I view these three elements of a central bank's responsibilities as closely interrelated and mutually supporting, in ways that I will endeavor to elaborate.
Before doing so, I might note that the global financial environment in which central banks operate has become an increasingly important factor in carrying out our responsibilities.
This is obviously true of smaller and more open economies like Belgium, but it is true also of countries like the United States that are sometimes thought to be self-contained.
Monetary policy in all countries must take account of its effects on, and feedback from, the rest of the world.
