Tokyo's role as one of the world's key financial centers depends importantly on the confidence of the international community in the Bank of Japan and the great respect in which it is held.
As Tokyo continues to evolve as a financial center, the role of the Bank of Japan will correspondingly increase, as well.
Frankly, when I think about the potential for serious disruption in international financial markets, I take considerable comfort from the high degree of cooperation between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve, with contacts at all levels and covering a full range of issues very strong and getting stronger.
The last time I addressed this distinguished group was four years ago.
Since then, of course, much has happened in international financial markets.
The processes of growth, globalization, and innovation have continued.
Extraordinary advances in risk measurement and risk management--and in sensitivity to risks in general--have been perhaps the most salutary aspects of that ongoing evolution.
Other developments, including the financial problems of banks and other financial institutions in Japan, but also, for example, the Mexican peso crisis and Barings, were less favorable and have posed serious challenges.
Nonetheless, I believe that from a long-term perspective the responses to those challenges will prove to have had important positive consequences as well.
One notable response to the developments in international financial markets came from the leaders of the G-7 countries.
