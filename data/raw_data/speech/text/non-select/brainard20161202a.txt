I'd like to begin by remembering our Federal Reserve colleague Teresa Curran--executive vice president and director of Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco--who recently passed away after a long illness.
Teresa's leadership on fintech was one of her many extraordinary contributions to the System.
With her characteristic enthusiasm, Teresa helped us prioritize this topic early on and had a strong influence in helping shape our work program--with an emphasis on assessing the opportunities and challenges of fintech in a balanced way.
We already miss her wise counsel here.
I'm sure Teresa would have appreciated this conference's gathering of academics, industry participants, and policymakers to exchange information and discuss current research related to financial innovation.
Why Is Fintech Important?
In my remarks today, I'd like to share a few thoughts about emerging financial technologies and their relevance to our work.1 Fintech has the potential to transform the way that financial services are delivered and designed as well as the underlying processes of payments, clearing, and settlement.2 The past few years have seen a proliferation of new digitally enabled financial products and services, in addition to new processes and platforms.
Just as smartphones revolutionized the way in which we interact with one another to communicate and share information, fintech may impact nearly every aspect of how we interact with each other financially, from payments and credit to savings and financial planning.
In our continuously connected, on-demand world, consumers, businesses, and financial institutions are all eager to find new ways to engage in financial transactions that are more convenient, timely, secure, and efficient.
