      <p>In the period immediately prior to September 11, there were tentative 
        signs that some sectors of the U.S. economy had begun to stabilize, contributing 
        to a hope that the worst of the previous cumulative weakness in world 
        economic activity was nearing an end. That hope was decisively dashed 
        by the tragic events of early September. Adding to the intense forces 
        weighing on asset prices and economic activity before September 11 were 
        new sources of uncertainty and risk that began to press down on global 
        demand for goods and services.<br>
        <br>
        In almost all areas of the world, economies weakened further, a cause 
        for increasing uneasiness. The synchronous slowing in activity raised 
        concerns that a self-reinforcing cycle of contraction, fed by perceptions 
        of greater economic risk, could develop. Such an event, though rare, would 
        not be unprecedented in business-cycle history.<br>
        <br>
        We had already observed a coincident deceleration in activity among the 
        world economies over the past year, owing apparently, at least in part, 
        to the retrenchment in the high-technology sector. The global nature of 
        most technology industries and the global reach of the capital markets 
        in which the firms in these industries are valued and funded appears to 
        have fostered a greater synchronousness in world activity in this cycle, 
        seemingly broader than has generally been the case. However, before the 
        terrorist attacks, it was far from obvious that this concurrent weakness 
        was becoming self-reinforcing.<br>
        <br>
        But, if ever a situation existed in which the fabric of business and consumer 
        confidence, both here and abroad, was vulnerable to being breached, the 
        shock of September 11 was surely it. Indeed, for a short period, in response 
        to that shock, U.S. economic activity did drop dramatically.<br>
        <br>
        But, arguably, our economy has not been weakening cumulatively in recent 
        weeks. In fact, indications of stabilization, similar in many respects 
        to those observed in the period immediately preceding September 11, have 
        been appearing with greater frequency. A possible significant contributor 
        to this emergence of stability--if that is what it is--may be the very 
        technologies that have fostered coincident global weakness: those that 
        have substantially improved access of business decisionmakers to real-time 
        information.<br>
        <br>
        Thirty years ago, the timeliness of available information varied across 
        companies and industries, often resulting in differences in the speed 
        and magnitude of their responses to changing business conditions. In contrast 
        to the situation that prevails today, businesses did not have real-time 
        data systems that enabled decisionmakers in different enterprises to work 
        from essentially the same set of information. In those earlier years, 
        imbalances were inadvertently allowed to build to such an extent that 
        their inevitable correction engendered significant economic stress. That 
        process of correction and the accompanying economic and financial disruptions 
        too often led to deep and prolonged recessions.<br>
        <br>
        Today, businesses have large quantities of data available virtually in 
        real time. As a consequence, they address and resolve economic imbalances 
        more rapidly than in the past. At the same time, firms are largely operating 
        with the same information set, and thus resolution of imbalances induces 
        parallel movements in activity. Contractions initially may be steeper, 
        but because imbalances are more readily contained, cyclical episodes overall 
        should be less severe than would be the case otherwise.<br>
        <br>
        In the current situation, inventories, especially among producers and 
        purchasers of high-tech products, did run to excess over the past year, 
        as sales forecasts went badly astray; alas, technology has not allowed 
        us to see into the future any more clearly than we could previously. But, 
        technology did facilitate the quick recognition of the weakening in sales 
        and backup of inventories. This enabled producers to respond forcefully, 
        as evidenced by output adjustments that have resulted in the extraordinary 
        rate of inventory liquidation currently under way.<br>
        <br>
        Inventories in many industries have been drawn down to levels at which 
        firms will soon need to taper off their rate of liquidation, if they have 
        not already done so. Indeed, in recent months, there have been fewer reports 
        from industrial purchasing managers that their customers' inventories 
        are too high. Moreover, the relative stability of industrial commodity 
        prices in recent weeks, and especially the recent firmness in the prices 
        of semiconductors, could be hinting at less intense stock drawdowns.<br>
        <br>
        A slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial 
        production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately. 
        That rise in production will, other things being equal, increase household 
        income and spending. The runoff of inventories, even apart from the large 
        reduction in motor vehicle stocks, remained sizable in the fourth quarter. 
        Hence, with production running well below sales, the potential positive 
        effect of the inevitable cessation of inventory liquidation on income 
        and spending could be significant.<br>
        <br>
        But that impetus to activity will be short lived unless the demand for 
        goods and services itself starts to rise. On that score, despite a number 
        of encouraging signs of stabilization, it is still premature to conclude 
        that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated 
        enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold. For that to happen, sustained 
        growth of final demand must kick in before the positive effects of the 
        swing from inventory liquidation to accumulation dissipate.<br>
        <br>
        For the household sector, which had been a major stabilizing force through 
        most of last year's slowdown, the outlook for demand is mixed. Low mortgage 
        interest rates and favorable weather have provided considerable support 
        to homebuilding in recent months. Moreover, attractive mortgage rates 
        have bolstered both the sales of existing homes and the realized capital 
        gains that those sales engender. They have also spurred refinancing of 
        existing homes and the associated liquification of increases in house 
        values. These gains have been important to the ongoing extraction of home 
        equity for consumption and home modernization.<br>
        <br>
        The recent rise in home mortgage rates, however, is likely to damp housing 
        activity and equity extraction. It is already having an effect on cash-outs 
        from refinancing. Cash-outs rose from an estimated annual rate of about 
        $20 billion in early 2000 to a rate of roughly $75 billion in the third 
        quarter of last year. But the pace of cash-outs has likely dropped noticeably 
        in response to the recent decline in refinancing activity that has followed 
        the backup in mortgage rates since early November.<br>
        <br>
        Consumer spending received a considerable spur from the sales of new motor 
        vehicles, which were remarkably strong in October and November owing to 
        major financing incentives. Sales dropped last month when the incentives 
        were scaled back, but have remained surprisingly resilient. Other consumer 
        spending appears to have advanced in recent months, though at a subdued 
        pace.<br>
        <br>
        The substantial declines in the prices of natural gas, fuel oil, and gasoline 
        have clearly provided some support to real disposable income and spending. 
        These price declines added more than $50 billion at an annual rate to 
        household purchasing power in the second half of last year. However, a 
        decline in energy prices provides, in effect, only a one-shot boost to 
        consumption, albeit one that is likely to take place over time. To have 
        a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of total personal consumption 
        expenditures, energy prices would need to continue to decline. Futures 
        prices do not suggest that such a decline is in the immediate offing, 
        but the forecast record of these markets is less than sterling.<br>
        <br>
        Although the quantitative magnitude and precise timing of the wealth effect 
        remain uncertain, the steep decline in stock prices since March 2000 has, 
        no doubt, curbed the growth of household spending. Although stock prices 
        recently have retraced a portion of their earlier losses, the restraining 
        effects from the net decline in equity values presumably have not, as 
        yet, fully played out. Future wealth effects will depend importantly on 
        whether corporate earnings improve to the extent currently embedded in 
        share prices.<br>
        <br>
        Perhaps most central to the outlook for consumer spending will be developments 
        in the labor market. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially 
        after September 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply. Over the past 
        month or so, however, initial claims for unemployment insurance have declined 
        markedly, on balance, suggesting some abatement in the rate of job loss.<br>
        <br>
        Although this development would be welcome, the unemployment rate may 
        well continue to rise for a time, and job losses can be expected to put 
        something of a damper on consumer spending. However, the extent of that 
        restraint will depend on how much of any rise in unemployment is the result 
        of weakened demand and how much reflects strengthened productivity. In 
        the latter case, average real incomes could rise, at least partially offsetting 
        losses of purchasing power that stem from diminished levels of employment.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, economic policies will have an important influence on household 
        spending in the period ahead. No doubt, we will continue to benefit from 
        the tendency of our tax and entitlement systems to buffer cyclical swings 
        in income. Moreover, despite the failure of Congress to enact further 
        tax cuts and spending increases, the continued phase-in of earlier reductions 
        in taxes and the significant expansion of discretionary spending already 
        enacted should provide noticeable short-term stimulus to demand.<br>
        <br>
        Some of this stimulus has likely been offset by increases in long-term 
        market interest rates, including those on home mortgages. The recent rise 
        in these rates largely reflects the perception of improved prospects for 
        the U.S. economy. But over the past year, some of the firmness of long-term 
        interest rates probably is the consequence of the fall of projected budget 
        surpluses and the implied less-rapid paydowns of Treasury debt.<br>
        <br>
        In our conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve responded to the 
        weakening economy over the past year by markedly lowering our target for 
        the federal funds rate. We accelerated the pace of rate reductions during 
        this period in response to the accelerated pace of economic adjustment. 
        Moreover, the magnitude of policy adjustment and the resulting low level 
        of the federal funds rate responded both to the strength of the forces 
        restraining demand and to the continued subdued pace of underlying inflation. 
        Liquidity, as a consequence, has expanded significantly, and the accompanying 
        lower interest rates have supported spending and held down the cost to 
        households of servicing debts.<br>
        <br>
        The dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing 
        consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook 
        in coming months. But, the broad contours of the present cycle have been, 
        and will continue to be, driven by the evolution of corporate profits 
        and capital investment.<br>
        <br>
        The retrenchment in capital spending over the past year was central to 
        the sharp slowing we experienced in overall activity. The steep rise in 
        high-tech spending that occurred in the early post-Y2K months was clearly 
        not sustainable. The demand for many of the newer technologies was growing 
        rapidly, but capacity was expanding even faster, exerting severe pressure 
        on prices and profits. New orders for equipment and software hesitated 
        in the middle of 2000, and then fell sharply as firms re-evaluated their 
        capital investment programs. Uncertainty about economic prospects boosted 
        risk premiums significantly, and this rise, in turn, propelled required, 
        or hurdle, rates of return to markedly elevated levels. In most cases, 
        businesses required that new investments pay off much more rapidly than 
        they had previously. For much of last year, the resulting decline in investment 
        outlays was fierce and unrelenting. Although the weakness was most pronounced 
        in the technology area, the reductions in capital outlays were broad-based.<br>
        <br>
        These cutbacks in capital spending interacted with, and were reinforced 
        by, falling profits and equity prices. Indeed, a striking feature of the 
        current cyclical episode relative to many earlier ones has been the virtual 
        absence of pricing power across much of American business, as increasing 
        globalization and deregulation enhanced competition. In this low-inflation 
        environment, firms have perceived very little capability to pass cost 
        increases on to customers. Growth in hourly labor compensation has slowed 
        in response to deteriorating economic conditions, but even those smaller 
        increases have continued to outstrip gains in output per hour for the 
        corporate sector on a consolidated basis. The result has been that profit 
        margins are still under pressure.<br>
        <br>
        Business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved 
        aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces. These efforts 
        have limited the rise in unit costs, attenuated the pressure on profit 
        margins, and ultimately helped to preserve the vast majority of private 
        sector jobs. To the extent that businesses are successful in stabilizing 
        and eventually boosting profits and cash flow, capital spending should 
        begin to recover more noticeably.<br>
        <br>
        Such success would likely be accompanied by a decline in elevated risk 
        premiums back to more normal levels and, with real rates of return on 
        high-tech equipment still attractive, should provide an additional spur 
        to new investment. When capital spending eventually recovers, its growth 
        is likely to be less frenetic than that which characterized 1999 and early 
        2000, when outlays were boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the extraordinarily 
        low cost of capital faced by many firms.<br>
        <br>
        Still, the evidence strongly suggests that new technologies will present 
        ample opportunities to earn enhanced rates of return. Indeed, anecdotal 
        reports from businesses around the country suggest that the exploitation 
        of available networking and other information technologies was only partially 
        completed when the cyclical retrenchment of the past year began. Many 
        business managers are still of the view, according to a recent survey 
        of purchasing managers, that less than half of currently available new, 
        and presumably profitable, supply chain technologies have been put into 
        use.<br>
        <br>
        While these opportunities remain abundant, they will now play out against 
        the backdrop of a major uncertainty that we all must deal with these days--the 
        specter of further terrorist incidents on American soil. It simply is 
        not possible to predict whether there will be any such incidents or to 
        forecast their possible consequences for the economy. But we can have 
        little doubt that the tragic events of September 11 have left obvious 
        marks on the economy that will not soon fade even though some of the initial 
        impact of the shock has receded. Importantly, as I suggested shortly after 
        the event, adjustments to new levels of perceived risk will cause a one-time 
        downward shift in the level of productivity.<br>
        <br>
        Clearly, businesses will be less comfortable now than they were before 
        September 11 in allowing inventories to shrink to minimal levels in a 
        just-in-time supply chain. Moreover, in some industries, resources will 
        need to be diverted from efficiency-enhancing capital investment to providing 
        security and contingency backup. Fragmentary data for the months following 
        September 11, however, indicate output per hour is holding up well. Temporary 
        labor-shedding may have overwhelmed the effects of added security and 
        redundancy. It is not yet clear whether the negative shock to output per 
        hour from the heightened risks is small, or just delayed. In any event, 
        once these adjustments are completed, the full benefits of more rapid 
        technological advance should show through to the growth of productivity.<br>
        <br>
        The central role that is being played by technological advance poses special 
        challenges to forecasters. Few technologies that influence our economic 
        future are truly anticipated much in advance. And even when they are anticipated, 
        their effect on economic growth is difficult to predict, in part because 
        their pace of diffusion and application is so uncertain. The latter consideration 
        is particularly significant to the longer-term rate of growth of productivity.<br>
        <br>
        The events of the past decade clearly illustrate those difficulties. Few 
        observers foresaw how microprocessors, integrated circuits, and the mating 
        of laser technology with fiber optics, even well into their development 
        and application, would rejuvenate the American economy.<br>
        <br>
        For example, as recently as a decade ago, the outlook was for a continuation 
        of meager gains in output per hour, with the rate of growth barely exceeding 
        one percent per year, if that. Instead, during the last half of the 1990s, 
        we experienced a surge in productivity growth well above the rate of increase 
        experienced in the previous quarter-century.<br>
        <br>
        Even as our economy slipped into recession, the growth of output per hour 
        remained positive and, as I indicated earlier, has held up well even in 
        the wake of September 11. Until last year, the hypothesis of an accelerated 
        productivity trend had not been tested in the contracting phase of a business 
        cycle. Recent developments have provided that test, and the early returns 
        certainly look favorable to the hypothesis.<br>
        <br>
        In retrospect, our economic structure changed in the mid-1990s. The crucial 
        agent of this remarkable change was the quantum leap in information availability.<br>
        <br>
        If the tentative indications that the contraction phase of this business 
        cycle is drawing to a close are ultimately confirmed, we will have experienced 
        a relatively mild downturn. To be sure, a great deal of real economic 
        pain has been felt over the past year and a half. But imbalances have 
        not been allowed to fester. They could have progressively undermined endeavors 
        at stability and prolonged this difficult period.<br>
        <br>
        The American economy has had to absorb some extraordinary shocks over 
        the past year and a half. For the economy to have weathered as well as 
        it has a severe deflation of equity asset values followed by an unprecedented 
        blow from terrorists to the foundations of our market systems is impressive. 
        In my judgment, this performance is a testament to the exceptional degree 
        of resilience and flexibility that our economy has gained in recent years, 
        much of which owes to advances not only in information technology, but 
        to the globalization and deregulation of our markets, as well. The adaptability 
        and resourcefulness of our businesses and workers have been especially 
        important in this trying period.<br>
        <br>
        There are sound reasons for concluding that the long-run picture remains 
        bright, and even recent signals about the current course of the economy 
        have turned from unremittingly negative through the late fall of last 
        year to a far more mixed set of signals recently. But I would emphasize 
        that we continue to face significant risks in the near term. Profits and 
        investment remain weak and, as I noted, household spending is subject 
        to restraint from the backup in interest rates, possible increases in 
        unemployment, and from the effects of widespread equity asset price deflation 
        over the past two years.<br>
        <br>
        But if the recent more favorable developments continue and gather momentum, 
        uncertainties will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and the pace of 
        capital investment increase. Should those gains in investment materialize, 
        they would, doubtless, embody the newest technologies. As we have witnessed 
        so clearly in recent years, advances in technology have enhanced the growth 
        of productivity, which, in turn, has been essential to lifting our standards 
        of living. </p>
