      <p>Good afternoon. I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk with 
        you, and I am enjoying being among old friends and neighbors here in Fergus 
        Falls. When I considered my remarks for today, I reflected on my years 
        in Fergus Falls. My reflection included the benefits of the small-town 
        quality of life that I experienced both while growing up and as a banker 
        focusing on the economic realities of small towns.</p>
      <p>I am sure that many people throughout rural America have experienced 
        the conflicting realities of rural economic life. On the one hand, the 
        appeal is enormous. People born and raised in small towns often want to 
        raise their families in such an environment. Less common, but not rare, 
        are people who spent formative years in larger cities and want instead 
        to experience the more hassle-free style of small-town life. </p>
      <p>For many people who feel so inclined, the barrier to staying, returning, 
        or moving to rural America is finding a job. For most of the last century, 
        rural America experienced a continual outmigration of its young people, 
        who moved to population centers where job opportunities were more plentiful. 
        That pattern was certainly true of my generation. But I was both surprised 
        and pleased upon moving back to Fergus Falls at age thirty-three to discover 
        that a significant number of the people moving back here were professional 
        people who could have found similar employment virtually anywhere in the 
        country. Numerous doctors, lawyers, dentists, educators, and other professionals 
        of my generation actively sought a combination of life style and professional 
        opportunity in communities such as Fergus Falls.</p>
      <p>It struck me at the time that, if professional people see the opportunity 
        to live in rural areas as a first choice rather than as a default option, 
        and if job opportunities permitted, rural America could experience renewed 
        growth. Further, I thought that if this situation was true for Fergus 
        Falls, it was also true elsewhere in rural America.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I was not entirely surprised to learn that, since the 1990s, 
        rural America has been experiencing a resurgence of economic opportunity. 
        Consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the 1990s, rural America saw population growth, reversing a 
          trend of several decades.</li>
        <li>More than half the rural counties in the nation experienced such growth.</li>
        <li>Between 1990 and 1999, 2.2 million more Americans moved from the city 
          to the country than moved from the country to the city. </li>
        <li>There are 2 million more jobs in rural America today than there were 
          a decade ago.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These facts are good news for rural America, but it is also true that 
        the benefits of the migration to rural America fall unevenly. For communities 
        in rural America to provide the benefits of rural living to more residents 
        and, in turn, for communities to benefit from an increased population 
        base, they must first understand the economic changes that affect the 
        rural economy. Today I will begin with a brief historical review, then 
        discuss the changing dynamics of economies in rural America, and close 
        by identifying the factors that will influence development.</p>
      <p>For more than a century, change has been the norm for rural communities. 
        Perhaps the most profound shift has been the transformation of the economic 
        base from a primarily agrarian system of small farms to a more diversified 
        structure with not only some farming but also service and manufacturing 
        activities. As late as the 1920s, about one-third of the U.S. population 
        lived on farms. But early in the last century, farmers began to substitute 
        tractors and combines for horses and mules, and the resulting gains in 
        efficiency meant that, over time, fewer farmers were needed to keep production 
        at a high level. This push from the farm sector worked with the lure of 
        salaried jobs in urban areas to spark a massive exodus of rural residents 
        to the cities. Later, around World War II, crop yields increased dramatically, 
        boosted by the widespread adoption of hybrid varieties and the use of 
        commercial fertilizers and chemicals; the production of livestock products 
        increased rapidly as well. These further gains in farm productivity helped 
        continue the migration from rural areas to urban ones; and for decades, 
        rural areas, in general, lost population. The population of Otter Tail 
        County, for instance, fell about 5 percent in each decade from the 1940s 
        through the 1970s. </p>
      <p>For a time, the widespread population declines in rural communities seemed 
        inexorable. But around 1990, demographers began to notice an upturn in 
        the population of many rural areas of the country. To examine the extent 
        of this apparent change in migration patterns, analysts at the U.S. Department 
        of Agriculture, using data from the Census Bureau, compared population 
        changes in the first half of the 1990s with those in the second half. 
        They found that roughly 480 rural counties lost population in both five-year 
        spans but that almost three times as many gained in both periods; another 
        480 or so had mixed changes in population. </p>
      <p>Here in Otter Tail County, one can easily see the two extremes in these 
        recent demographic patterns. We are on a dividing line between regions 
        that in the 1990s experienced persistent population declines and regions 
        that seem to have begun an upswing in residents. To our west and south--in 
        Minnesota and fanning out through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, 
        and Iowa--most rural counties lost residents throughout the 1990s. In 
        contrast, counties to our east and north generally saw substantial gains 
        in population throughout the decade. Otter Tail County is solidly among 
        the growing counties: According to the Census data, our population increased<br>
        12-3/4 percent over the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Why have counties such as Otter Tail been among the winners in the population 
        migration? To examine why some counties emerged from the 1990s with population 
        increases, we need to review the changing nature of the rural economy. 
      </p>
      <p>The most notable change in our rural economy is the decline of agriculture 
        as a dominating industry. This statement is not news to Otter Tail County 
        residents for the county has experienced a continual decline in the number 
        of full-time farms. From 1992 to 1997, Otter Tail County experienced an 
        11 percent decline in the number of full-time farms. However, over that 
        same five-year period, the market value of farm products sold from Otter 
        Tail County farms increased 18 percent, to more than $200 million. This 
        pattern is typical of rural areas throughout the United States. The total 
        output of agricultural products continues to grow, but fewer people and 
        fewer full-time farms are producing and selling our nation's crops and 
        livestock.</p>
      <p>A less evident, but still important, trend is in the manufacturing sector. 
        Though manufacturing was thought by many to be the primary alternative 
        to agriculture as a source of employment in rural areas, a recent study 
        indicates that manufacturing jobs in rural areas have increased only slightly 
        since the mid-1970s. Though job growth in the manufacturing sector has 
        been slow, it is important to note that manufacturing is the largest category 
        of employment in one out of five rural counties.</p>
      <p>The substantial growth in jobs in rural America over the past decade 
        has occurred in the services sector. This sector includes such producer 
        services as financial, legal, and business support services. It also includes 
        important social services such as health and education. Finally, it includes 
        the consumer services involved in providing recreational and personal 
        services. Other areas that are growing, though more slowly, are retail 
        and government services.</p>
      <p>The various parts of the service sector of the economy have grown for 
        numerous reasons, but for purposes of today's discussion an important 
        reason is that these job categories are largely independent of the natural 
        resources of a given area. Earlier in our history, the areas with the 
        most abundant natural resources, such as rich agricultural land and mineral 
        or energy resources, determined, to a great extent, the viability of a 
        local economy. With the dramatic shift in job growth to service-related 
        industries, many other factors affect the economic viability of a given 
        rural area.</p>
      <p>Examples of such factors are the proximity to metropolitan areas and 
        the access to major highway systems. For the past two decades, these two 
        factors have been the most important in distinguishing strong economic 
        performers in rural areas. Though the statistics do not yet indicate it, 
        these characteristics will likely fade in importance as the growth in 
        electronic commerce continues to minimize the need for proximity to urban 
        areas.</p>
      <p>A factor that has been important for economic growth for two decades 
        in rural areas is the availability of scenic and recreational amenities. 
        Several Northern Minnesota counties, including Otter Tail, have benefited 
        from these natural amenities. An important component of the growing economic 
        base of counties with this characteristic has been the impact of retirees, 
        who now represent a significant and highly mobile economic force. The 
        phenomenon of aging baby boomers has made retirement more than just a 
        demographic fact of life; it is an economic source of strength for rural 
        areas that retirees find attractive.</p>
      <p>A consistent factor identified with rural economic growth is lower labor 
        and business costs. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 
        identified &quot;underemployment&quot; as a characteristic of the rural 
        economy in this area. As communities assess their availability of labor 
        resources, they discover that low unemployment does not always accurately 
        reflect labor availability, such as when higher- paying opportunities 
        generate job applicants in numbers disproportionate to the unemployment 
        rate for that area. A challenge for rural areas, however, is not to be 
        content with being the low-cost option of available labor. Instead, rural 
        America's communities are working to grow value by generating higher-skilled 
        jobs in order to attract better-paying and more stable career opportunities.</p>
      <p>Two other factors affect the economic viability of rural areas. First, 
        good educational facilities, such as colleges and technical training schools, 
        and a better-educated work force correlate very strongly with economic 
        growth. Second, as highlighted by a recent Federal Reserve study, high 
        agglomeration--a concentration of business activity--tends to lower business 
        costs by facilitating access to specialized materials or business services.</p>
      <p>In summary, the economic prosperity of rural America is no longer tied 
        exclusively to the geographic or natural resources of the immediate area. 
        Communities in rural areas can affect their economic future by understanding 
        the changes that have occurred in rural America and adjusting to them.</p>
      <p>I would like to take a few minutes to consider the roles of the financial 
        sector and of the Federal Reserve in rural development. Certainly, a strong 
        and active banking community is a tremendous asset in an area's development. 
        Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can 
        channel funds into those loans that are most likely to benefit the local 
        economy.</p>
      <p>With regard to my institution's role in promoting the growth of rural 
        communities, the Federal Reserve is charged with maintaining credit conditions 
        that are conducive to our nation's overall economic progress. To be sure, 
        our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot effectively 
        be targeted toward individual industries or particular regions. However, 
        the Federal Reserve can help create a credit climate that fosters rural 
        progress in general, a climate in which the natural advantages of individual 
        communities can be realized.</p>
      <p>We nurture this progressive credit climate by striving to maintain low 
        inflation, which makes it easier for entrepreneurs to bear the long-term 
        risks associated with creating new enterprises. We also strive to maintain 
        strong banking organizations that can dependably offer the wide range 
        of financial services that a growing community requires. Finally, we promote 
        sound lending practices among banking organizations so that solid enterprises 
        have adequate access to credit and so that the accumulated capital of 
        the community is not dissipated by lending for overly risky schemes.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned earlier, we cannot target our monetary policy toward particular 
        industries or regions. However, the Federal Reserve has developed a number 
        of ways to monitor the effects of its policies on various parts of the 
        economy. For instance, we conduct a quarterly Survey of the Terms of Bank 
        Lending to Farmers, which we use to follow credit conditions in the agricultural 
        sector, and we publish these data with other information on farm financial 
        conditions in the Agricultural Finance Databook. In addition, our Reserve 
        Banks--the Minneapolis Bank covers the Fergus Falls area--are a vital 
        source of information on regional economic developments. This information 
        includes the Beige Book reports that are compiled by the staff at each 
        Reserve Bank before meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. </p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve Banks have initiated various programs to study rural 
        trends and promote economic development in their regions. In broad terms, 
        the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City recently established the Center 
        for the Study of Rural America, which is intended to furnish the Federal 
        Reserve and the nation with timely data and analyses of the progress of 
        rural areas. Locally, the Minneapolis Bank has a Community Affairs Department 
        that has been involved in several programs to disseminate information 
        about rural development in this region.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and Kansas City together with 
        staff members at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., are primarily 
        responsible for assembling today's analysis.</p>
      <p>To conclude, as a product of rural America, I find that being an advocate 
        of the benefits of small town life is quite natural. Also, having participated 
        for many years in the economic development effort of this community, I 
        have been very aware of the traditional difficulty in attracting people 
        to our communities. The trend that began within the past ten years to 
        reverse decades of outmigration is encouraging, but the benefits will 
        not fall evenly in all areas. As economic growth in rural America becomes 
        no longer tied primarily to the natural resources of their immediate area, 
        individual communities will have more opportunity than ever to affect 
        their own growth and economic prosperity.<br>
