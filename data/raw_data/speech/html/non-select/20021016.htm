<TR> 
    <TD> <p>Against the backdrop of the wide swings in equity prices in recent 
        years, the financial market repercussions accompanying corporate accounting 
        scandals in the United States, and the current difficulties in key emerging 
        market economies, it seems appropriate to reconsider the role of central 
        banks in fostering financial stability. This session asks us to address 
        a deceptively simple question: Should financial stability be an explicit 
        central bank objective on a par with other objectives such as price stability 
        and sustainable economic growth? At the outset, let me emphasize that 
        all of the views I will express in answer to this question are my own 
        and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board. To summarize 
        the discussion below, financial stability has been and always will be 
        a fundamental objective of central banks. Indeed, many central banks around 
        the world&#8212;including the Federal Reserve&#8212;were established in 
        part to serve as bulwarks against chronic episodes of financial instability 
        and the attendant adverse consequences for the economy. So at this basic 
        level, a financial stability objective for central banks seems entirely 
        appropriate. That said, difficult issues may arise at times in judging 
        how much weight should be attached to financial stability versus other 
        central bank objectives and also in judging just how &#8220;activist&#8221; 
        central banks should be in pursuing their financial stability objectives. 
        In this connection, the Federal Reserve has found it useful to focus on 
        its financial stability objectives primarily through the lens of its macroeconomic 
        goals&#8212;price stability and sustainable long-run growth. That is, 
        the Federal Reserve seeks to foster conditions that will contribute to 
        price stability and sustainable output growth now and in the future. </p>
      <p> <strong>1. Public Policy and Financial Stability</strong><br>
        It seems useful at the outset to define financial stability and to do 
        so by defining its opposite, financial instability. In my view, the most 
        useful concept of financial instability for central banks and other authorities 
        involves some notion of market failure or externalities that can potentially 
        impinge on real economic activity. Economic research in recent years has 
        identified a variety of market imperfections such as moral hazard and 
        asymmetric information that, if widespread and significant, can result 
        in threats to the functioning of any financial system, such as panics, 
        bank runs, asset price bubbles, excessive leverage, and inadequate risk 
        management. Such outcomes are typically highly undesirable from a social 
        welfare perspective; financial prices can diverge sharply and for prolonged 
        periods from fundamentals, credit conditions may be too lax at times and 
        at other times far too restrictive, and spending and real activity may 
        be subject to much wider swings than would otherwise be the case.</p>
      <p> Thus, for the purposes of this paper, I&#8217;ll define financial instability 
        as a situation characterized by these three basic criteria: (1) some important 
        set of financial asset prices seem to have diverged sharply from fundamentals; 
        and/or (2) market functioning and credit availability, domestically and 
        perhaps internationally, have been significantly distorted; with the result 
        that (3) aggregate spending deviates (or is likely to deviate) significantly, 
        either above or below, from the economy&#8217;s ability to produce.</p>
      <p> With this definition of financial instability, a clear public policy 
        interest arises for central banks and other authorities to act in two 
        distinct roles in pursuing financial stability&#8212;prevention of instability 
        and management of the consequences once markets become unstable. In the 
        area of prevention, perhaps the single most important thing a central 
        bank can do is to foster a macroeconomic environment of low and stable 
        inflation and sustainable economic growth. Absent such desirable macro 
        fundamentals, the risks of financial instability are almost certainly 
        higher and the effects of financial instability when it arises all the 
        more pernicious. Beyond conducting sound macro policy, central banks have 
        traditionally been involved in myriad activities, such as formulating 
        appropriate financial regulations, implementing effective bank supervision, 
        and operating or overseeing efficient payment systems, all of which help 
        to attenuate the risks of financial instability. </p>
      <p> Under the heading of management, central banks can alter monetary policy 
        to forestall or mitigate the consequences of financial instability for 
        the economy. When such instability slides into crisis, they can employ 
        their basic tools to help alleviate liquidity pressures and to bolster 
        public confidence. Liquidity pressures can be addressed, for example, 
        through generous provision of reserves via open market operations and 
        direct lending to depository institutions via a lender-of-last-resort 
        or discount window function. Other monetary policy tools can be employed 
        as well, such as possibly cutting reserve requirements and, of course, 
        lowering policy interest rates to provide a boost to the economy. </p>
      <p> The events of September 11 last year underscored how important it is 
        for central banks to be ready to act promptly in a crisis to execute all 
        of their core functions and flexibly adapt their rules. An important aspect 
        of this preparedness is ensuring that critical systems and policy tools 
        are robust to any and all contingencies. To this end, the Federal Reserve 
        has been very actively implementing additional layers of backup and contingency 
        arrangements for all of our key payment systems and operations. In the 
        same vein, we are also encouraging banks and other financial institutions 
        to ensure the robustness of their own systems. Although private firms 
        that maximize profits do have market incentives to maintain adequate backup 
        and contingency arrangements, they may not take into account the full 
        social, or external, value of such arrangements. Because of this, central 
        banks and other authorities have a useful role to play in encouraging 
        and supporting private sector planning and investments that fully reflect 
        the social value of contingency arrangements.</p>
      <p> Having now proposed a definition of financial stability and listed a 
        variety of ways in which central banks can promote financial stability, 
        I would add a cautionary note. Focusing on the various threats of financial 
        disruptions and the need for public intervention to promote financial 
        stability, one can sometimes lose sight of how remarkably efficient and 
        stable financial markets typically have been in recent decades. When new 
        information arrives, we expect that financial asset prices should respond 
        quickly, and, thus, there is every reason to believe that asset prices 
        may be volatile at times. We must also bear in mind that financial markets 
        are dynamic and evolving. The incorporation of new technologies and the 
        constant interplay of the forces of competition, deregulation, and globalization 
        imply that some firms, possibly even quite important ones, will fail over 
        time through a process of economic &#8220;natural selection&#8221; or 
        &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; in which more efficient business models 
        displace the status quo. Thus, there is a challenge and a tension for 
        central banks and other authorities in differentiating between developments 
        that truly represent externalities or market failures, and thus warrant 
        public intervention, versus those that are just part of the normal, unavoidable, 
        and largely positive turbulence in a dynamic market.</p>
      <p><strong> 2. Central Banks&#8217; Interest in Financial Stability </strong><br>
        For obvious reasons, central banks have long had a keen interest in financial 
        stability. First and foremost, financial instability as defined above 
        poses a severe threat to important macroeconomic objectives such as sustainable 
        output growth and price stability. Largely for this reason, nearly all 
        central banks are empowered and expected to act as a lender of last resort 
        in financial crises. Indeed, recognition of the role of central banks 
        in stemming financial crises dates back to Thornton and Bagehot in the 
        eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, respectively. This historical 
        function of central banks as a potential source of emergency liquidity 
        assistance to markets&#8212;through open market operations&#8212;or to 
        particular institutions&#8212;through discount window lending&#8212;creates 
        a need for central banks to keep close tabs on markets for signs of instability 
        and to be prepared for action should the provision of emergency liquidity 
        assistance prove necessary. Moreover, monetary policy is implemented largely 
        through operations in financial markets, and the transmission of monetary 
        policy to the real economy depends crucially on the smooth functioning 
        of key financial institutions and markets. Attainment of sustainable real 
        growth with stable prices in turn will make the economy less prone to 
        financial instability. Finally, yet another manifestation of central banks&#8217; 
        interest in financial stability stems from their role in the operation 
        or oversight of payment systems that, in turn, act as the critical &#8220;plumbing&#8221; 
        supporting activity in financial markets.</p>
      <p> As noted above, financial stability is an important objective for all 
        central banks, and this fact has been incorporated, to varying degrees, 
        in central bank charters. In the case of the Federal Reserve, financial 
        stability concerns were at the core of the Federal Reserve Act. Indeed, 
        the Federal Reserve owes its existence to the financial instability of 
        the U.S. economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Early 
        attempts to create a central bank in the United States&#8212;the First 
        Bank of the United States (1791-1811) and the Second Bank of the United 
        States (1816-1836)&#8212;were undone by the deep public distrust, particularly 
        in southern and western states, of the concentration of financial power 
        in an institution created by the federal government. Left without a central 
        bank for the entire period between 1836 and 1913, the U.S. financial system 
        had no effective backstop to guard against the periodic financial panics 
        that occurred over these years. As a rule, these panics were soon followed 
        by sharp contractions in economic activity. The panic and economic downturn 
        sparked by the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in 1907 were 
        particularly acute, and prompted the appointment of a National Monetary 
        Commission in 1908 to study and recommend structural changes that could 
        improve the stability of the financial system. After the Commission concluded 
        a lengthy and exhaustive report (twenty-three volumes) and following intense 
        public debate, Congress finally passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, 
        which created the Federal Reserve System. </p>
      <p> The preamble of the Federal Reserve Act, stating the purpose of the 
        Federal Reserve, simply read that it was created &#8220;To provide for 
        the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, 
        to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more 
        effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes.&#8221; 
        This language implicitly embodied financial stability as an objective 
        of the Federal Reserve. The references to an &#8220;elastic currency&#8221; 
        and the &#8220;rediscounting of commercial paper&#8221; fundamentally 
        reflected concerns about financial market liquidity, and the reference 
        to &#8220;more effective supervision of banking&#8221; captured the desire 
        to develop a means to avoid or mitigate banking crises. More specific 
        references to financial stability were implemented twenty years later 
        with the revisions of the Federal Reserve Act that were implemented in 
        the depth of the financial and economic crisis of the Great Depression. 
        These Depression-era revisions granted the Federal Reserve &#8220;emergency&#8221; 
        lending powers.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup><a name="f1"></a></p>
      <p> More than forty years more were to pass before the Federal Reserve Act 
        would contain an explicit statement of its macro policy objectives. Those 
        objectives, added in 1977, state that &#8220;The Board of Governors of 
        the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall 
        maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate 
        with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to 
        promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and 
        moderate long-term interest rates.&#8221; </p>
      <p> <em><strong>Other Central Bank Charters</strong></em><br>
        Other countries have also recognized the interdependence of macroeconomic 
        performance and financial stability and, as a result, many central bank 
        charters reflect a concern for both macro objectives&#8212;such as price 
        stability and satisfactory economic performance&#8212;and financial stability. 
         <a name="t1"></a><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports some key passages 
        from several central bank statutes. Text in italics indicates passages 
        that would seem to provide an explicit goal for the central bank in pursuing 
        financial stability. Text that is highlighted could be interpreted as 
        encompassing financial stability as an implicit central bank objective. 
      </p>
      <p> What can be said about the overall pattern of statutory financial stability 
        objectives among central banks? At least among the small sample of central 
        banks listed in Table 1, all have at least some implicit references to 
        financial stability and many have quite explicit references to financial 
        stability as a factor that central banks need to consider. In many cases, 
        the explicit references to financial stability fall in the realm of banking 
        and the efficient operation of the payment system. However, some have 
        references that seem to embody a broader notion of financial stability. 
      </p>
      <p> <strong>3. Financial Stability Objectives: Relative Weight and Activism</strong><br>
        The foregoing discussion suggests that financial stability to some degree 
        already is an important objective for central banks around the world, 
        even for those that are sometimes viewed as solely concerned with price 
        stability. The real question then may not be so much whether financial 
        stability should be a central bank objective, but rather how policymakers 
        should weigh that objective in reaching policy decisions. Here one could 
        imagine a range of possibilities. At one extreme, a central bank might 
        focus almost entirely on an objective such as price stability with financial 
        stability concerns only entering in an extreme scenario when a crisis 
        is underway. Svensson (2002) labels this a strict inflation targeting 
        regime.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup><a name="f2"></a> At another extreme, 
        a central bank might be highly sensitive to signs of financial instability 
        and be quite willing to take pre-emptive policy actions to address potential 
        instabilities even when such steps might not be warranted solely by reference 
        to the near-term outlook for price stability and economic activity. In 
        a thought-provoking paper, Borio and Lowe (2002) develop a rationale for 
        just such an activist, pre-emptive approach by a central bank in a pursuing 
        financial stability objective.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup><a name="f3"></a> 
        In a nutshell, they argue that financial imbalances may develop even at 
        times when prices are stable and output is close to potential. As a result, 
        central banks need to be prepared to take pre-emptive actions to head 
        off potential financial instability even when such policy actions may 
        not be fully justified by the outlook for inflation and output.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup><a name="f4"></a> 
      </p>
      <p> There seem to be at least three basic issues that arise in contemplating 
        the degree of activism that central banks should adopt in pursuing a financial 
        stability objective. To summarize briefly: The first basic issue involves 
        questions about how a financial stability objective would affect central 
        bank incentives and interact with the central bank&#8217;s other policy 
        goals. Although I do not want to overemphasize the point, a financial 
        stability objective that is accorded too much weight could, at the margin, 
        impair the conduct of monetary policy in achieving macro ends. A second 
        issue involves how a financial stability objective might be perceived 
        by the public and investors. On this score, it seems likely that a central 
        bank adopting a highly activist approach in the pursuit of a financial 
        stability objective would court moral hazard. And finally, there are serious 
        questions about whether a very activist approach to financial stability 
        could end up contributing to the volatility of economic variables.</p>
      <p> <em><strong>Interactions with Other Policy Objectives </strong></em><br>
        One basic issue is how much weight central banks should attach to financial 
        stability as an objective vis-&agrave;-vis their other objectives. Of 
        course, in many cases, the relative weight a central bank places on financial 
        stability may not be especially important if a financial stability objective 
        is essentially auxiliary and tends primarily to reinforce the rationale 
        for policy actions warranted by other objectives. For example, a sudden 
        seizing up in financial markets is likely to be associated with a weakening 
        in aggregate demand. In this case, the pursuit of monetary policy objectives 
        and a financial stability objective would be largely in accord and both 
        would be served by additional monetary policy stimulus. Conversely, a 
        significant and unwarranted easing in credit supply conditions might be 
        accompanied by growth of output well above that of potential. Again, in 
        this case, financial stability considerations would tend to support the 
        tightening of monetary policy that is justified in the first instance 
        by the goal of economic stabilization.</p>
      <p> However, there is some potential for perceived conflicts between the 
        traditional macro policy objectives and a financial stability objective. 
        Sometimes in tightening the stance of policy, for example, policymakers 
        are concerned about the possibility that outsized financial market reactions 
        could occur or that an associated decline in asset prices will reveal 
        financial vulnerabilities in some sectors. At the margin, it would seem 
        that a financial stability objective that was weighted quite heavily would 
        tend to make that concern more pronounced, which arguably could hinder 
        the effectiveness of monetary policy in securing price stability and sustainable 
        real growth. For example, one might wonder whether the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 
        changes in procedures in the late 1970s to target a narrow monetary aggregate, 
        with the attendant rapid increase in the level of the federal funds rate, 
        would have been possible in a regime that tended to view sharp swings 
        in interest rates as a threat to financial stability. Potential problems 
        also can arise when central banks need to implement policy easings. For 
        example, some have argued that the Bank of Japan was too slow in easing 
        policy in response to the decline in economic activity in the early 1990s, 
        partly because it feared that an aggressive easing would risk reinflating 
        asset price bubbles.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup><a name="f5"></a> </p>
      <p><em><strong> Moral Hazard</strong></em> <br>
        Another important issue raised by a very activist approach to pursuit 
        of financial stability objectives is how such an approach would affect 
        the incentives of market participants. It seems quite possible that wide 
        recognition that central banks place heavy weight on warding off financial 
        instability could work to exacerbate moral hazard. Investors might conclude 
        that a central bank with a very activist approach in addressing financial 
        instability would be more inclined in many scenarios to step in to forestall 
        a crisis. For example, investors may perceive that an activist central 
        bank would be more likely to come to the rescue of large financial institutions 
        that are perceived to be systemically important&#8212;a perception that 
        would tend to reinforce a view that some institutions are &#8220;too big 
        to fail.&#8221; Moral hazard may also arise at the macro level as well. 
        If investors are convinced the Federal Reserve will aggressively ease 
        policy in response to adverse shocks to particular markets, they may undervalue 
        the risks they assume in their investment decisions. This perception could 
        also lead to a misallocation of resources and, paradoxically, contribute 
        to a deterioration in financial stability over a long horizon.</p>
      <p> <em><strong>Inadvertent Destabilizing Actions</strong></em><br>
        Still another concern that might be associated with a highly activist 
        pursuit of a financial stability objective is the possibility of inadvertently 
        contributing to greater variability in macroeconomic variables. As Milton 
        Friedman famously cautioned many years ago, when the lags and impact of 
        monetary policy actions are uncertain, activist monetary policy aimed 
        at damping output fluctuations, albeit well-intentioned, can easily end 
        up amplifying such fluctuations instead. One scenario in which this concern 
        seems especially relevant today is the case of asset price bubbles. Some 
        authors, including Borio and Lowe, have suggested that a central bank 
        may be able to take actions to burst such bubbles at an early stage and 
        thereby avert some especially serious future consequences if the bubble 
        otherwise were to continue to inflate for some time before bursting. To 
        be sure, central banks can and should lean against the wind to the extent 
        that such asset price distortions affect the outlook for inflation and 
        output. But to go beyond this to a policy of actively seeking to burst 
        a bubble seems very problematic&#8212;there are simply too many uncertainties 
        involved. One can never be sure that a bubble is inflating. And even if 
        a bubble could be identified with certainty, calibrating the necessary 
        policy actions necessary to burst a bubble without significant damage 
        to the real economy would be extraordinarily difficult.<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup><a name="f6"></a></p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>4. Incorporating Financial Stability in a Decision-Making Framework</strong><br>
        The previous discussion suggests that there may be significant problems 
        associated with an overly activist approach in pursuing financial stability 
        objectives. But this begs the question of just how a central bank should 
        take financial stability considerations into account in reaching policy 
        decisions. In conducting monetary policy, the Federal Reserve normally 
        prefers to focus on its broad macro policy objectives&#8212;low inflation 
        and sustainable output growth&#8212;and to consider financial instability 
        implicitly through its effect on these fundamental variables. Financial 
        instabilities that are significant enough to cause the expected path either 
        of output to move significantly above or below that of estimated potential 
        output or of inflation to deviate from intentions are then a cause for 
        concern and policy can be eased or tightened as appropriate. Admittedly, 
        determining what is &#8220;appropriate&#8221; over an extended horizon 
        may involve complicated and difficult judgments about the short- and long-run 
        effects of alternative policy prescriptions: It is possible, for example, 
        that attaining long-run goals for sustainable growth may require some 
        sacrifice of output in the near term. Nonetheless, concerns about financial 
        instability in this instance would be evaluated largely by reference to 
        expectations about inflation and output.</p>
      <p> But there may also be cases in which a central bank faced with the prospect 
        of financial instability needs to adjust policy by more than could be 
        justified solely by the forecasts for output and inflation. In my view, 
        though, this is perfectly consistent with a central bank that conducts 
        monetary policy using forecasts for key macro variables as its primary 
        guideposts but also considers the risks to the forecasts for those key 
        macro variables.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup><a name="f7"></a> </p>
      <p>One might think of this as a process of stress testing by monetary policy 
        decision makers in which they regularly assess not just the likely path 
        of output and inflation in reaching their policy decisions but also the 
        potential for adverse outcomes in light of recent or potential shocks. 
        For example, the FOMC reviews documents prior to each meeting that give 
        the staff&#8217;s forecasts for inflation, output, and other variables 
        based on economic models and the informed judgment of the staff. That 
        forecast forms a baseline for discussion of policy alternatives at each 
        FOMC meeting, although FOMC members of course develop their own view of 
        the economic outlook. Issues of financial stability can be fairly readily 
        incorporated in this process by considering &#8220;what if&#8221; exercises. 
        For example, following a sharp increase in risk spreads in fixed-income 
        markets, FOMC members might look not just at a baseline forecast but also 
        how that forecast might change if some type of financial instability&#8212;perhaps 
        a further, more extreme deterioration in credit availability&#8212;were 
        to ensue. This scenario might influence the FOMC&#8217;s monetary policy 
        decision, depending on the likelihood of the scenario and the potential 
        costs in terms of output or inflation variability associated with it. 
        This basic framework of guiding policy not just by the likely path of 
        key macro variables but also by a sense of the risks to that outlook provides 
        a structured way to incorporate concerns about financial instability into 
        the broader policy discussion.</p>
      <p> <em><strong>Recent Episodes of Financial Instability</strong></em><br>
        Unfortunately, central banks including the Federal Reserve have faced 
        an elevated frequency of episodes involving real or potential financial 
        instability in recent years. The discussion below provides a brief review 
        of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s approach in three such instances, and illustrates 
        how its actions could be rationalized in the decision-making framework 
        described above.</p>
      <p> <strong>Fall of 1998: </strong>The period of global financial turmoil 
        touched off by the Russian debt default in August 1998 and then greatly 
        exacerbated by the well-publicized travails of the hedge fund Long Term 
        Capital Management (LTCM) was perhaps the most intense episode of financial 
        instability in recent years. The Federal Reserve, like other central banks, 
        paid close attention to an array of financial indicators at this time. 
        Nearly all such indicators portrayed a dour picture of economic prospects&#8212;risk 
        spreads widened sharply, stocks prices fell, and banks reported tightening 
        terms and standards on business loans. Also disturbing were reports from 
        contacts with market participants that capital markets were seizing up 
        as dealers and other market makers recoiled from risk-taking. A sharp 
        widening in the spread between off-the-run and on-the-run Treasury securities 
        underscored the fact that investors were willing to pay a very high premium 
        for liquidity. Facing what some were referring to as the most acute financial 
        crisis in decades, the Federal Reserve eased policy by 75 basis points 
        in three equal steps, including an intermeeting move in mid-October of 
        1998, and maintained that lower funds rate through June of the subsequent 
        year. In part, these actions were motivated by a change in economic forecasts. 
        But at least part of this cautious behavior reflected the FOMC&#8217;s 
        concerns about financial instabilities and associated downside risks to 
        the economic forecast. Indeed, the minutes from the September 29, 1998, 
        FOMC meeting reported: 
      <blockquote> &#8220;In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
        economic conditions, members focused on developments that <em>pointed 
        to the potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending</em>. 
        They recognized that there were at present few statistical indications 

        that the economy was on a significantly slower growth track. Indeed, the 
        available data suggested that consumer expenditures and business investment 
        retained considerable strength. At the same time, however, investors' 
        perceptions of risks and their aversion to taking on more risk had increased 
        markedly in financial markets around the world. That change in sentiment 
        was exacerbating financial and economic problems in a number of important 
        trading partners of the United States. In addition, it was generating 
        lower equity prices and tightening credit availability in U.S. financial 
        markets. As a consequence, <em>the downside risks to the domestic expansion 
        appeared to have risen substantially in recent weeks</em>.&#8221; [emphasis 
        added] </blockquote>
      <p> <strong>Productivity Growth and the Stock Price Runup:</strong> Economic 
        developments in the United States in the late 1990s were quite favorable. 
        Output growth was unusually strong and, in no small part, that strength 
        seemed attributable to a sizable pickup in the trend growth of labor productivity 
        spurred by the proliferation of new technologies, especially in the computing 
        and telecommunications sectors. Investors read the favorable productivity 
        trends as auguring enhanced profit growth, prompting a substantial runup 
        in equity prices in 1999 and into 2000 that pushed standard valuation 
        measures&#8212;such as price-earnings ratios&#8212;well above historical 
        benchmarks. Although it is difficult to identify an equity risk premium 
        with great precision, it certainly seemed at the time that investors were 
        quite optimistic about the returns they could expect to earn by holding 
        equities. The rise in equity wealth and strong growth of income over this 
        period contributed to a brisk pace of consumer spending and an accompanying 
        decline in the personal savings rate. Core measures of inflation, however, 
        remained quite subdued even as the unemployment rate and other measures 
        of resource utilization moved to levels that previously would have been 
        viewed as threatening a rise in inflation pressures.</p>
      <p> In a sense, this period is similar to the situation that Borio and Lowe 
        posit in which &#8220;imbalances&#8221; may develop even during a period 
        when the current macroeconomic environment is viewed as quite favorable. 
        The FOMC, however, did not frame its policy deliberations over this period 
        in terms of the need to take action to address a potential bubble in the 
        stock market. Rather, it focused on the outlook for output and inflation 
        and the risks to that outlook. The FOMC was particularly aware that the 
        stronger trend productivity growth would tend to be associated with a 
        higher level of &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; real interest rates and that 
        the degree of monetary policy restraint associated with any given setting 
        of the target funds rate would need to be judged in this light.</p>
      <p> The FOMC responded to these economic developments by tightening policy 
        appreciably, moving the target federal funds rate up from 4-3/4 percent 
        in early 1999 to 6-1/2 percent in May of 2000. In explaining its actions, 
        the FOMC noted that it was concerned that growth of aggregate demand would 
        outstrip the growth in potential supply, leading to imbalances that would 
        pose a risk of inflation pressures. For example, in explaining its actions 
        in August of 1999 and February of 2000, the FOMC stated:
      <blockquote> &#8220;Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together 
        with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally 
        in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly <em>diminish 
        the risk of rising inflation going forward</em>.&#8221; (August 24, 1999). 
      </blockquote>
		
      <blockquote> &#8220;The Committee remains concerned that over time increases 
        in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even 
        after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. <em>Such 
        trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's 
        record economic expansion</em>.&#8221; (February 1, 2000). [emphasis added] 
      </blockquote>
      <p>An important factor underlying the Committee&#8217;s sense of the risks 
        of inflationary pressures was the role of accelerating productivity growth 
        in boosting earnings expectations and stock prices which, in turn, were 
        providing considerable impetus to wealth and spending. For example, the 
        minutes of the February 2000 meeting noted:
        
      <blockquote> &#8220;In the Committee's review of current and prospective 
        economic developments, members commented that the economy still seemed 
        to be growing very vigorously as it entered the new year&#8230;.<em>Accelerating 
        productivity, although adding to the growth of the economy's potential 
        output, also had induced expectations of rapidly accelerating business 
        earnings that in turn had generated sharp increases in stock market wealth 
        and lifted the growth of purchasing power and spending above that in incomes. 
        Relatively high real interest rates that reflected the increased productivity 
        and damped the rise in asset values would be needed to help restore balance</em>.&#8221; 
        [emphasis added] </blockquote>
        
      <strong>September 11 Attacks: </strong>The terrorist attacks offered another 
      example of the way in which policy decisions could be shaped importantly 
      by concerns about potential financial instabilities viewed as risks to the 
      economic forecast. On top of the appalling loss of life, the attacks caused 
      major damage to the physical infrastructure of a number of key firms central 
      to trading and market making activities. In an economy that had already 
      been weakening prior to the attacks, many policy makers worried that the 
      decline in stock prices, widening in risk spreads, and impairment of market 
      functioning raised the odds of highly adverse events in which economic activity 
      could plunge. In view of these risks, the FOMC eased policy 50 basis points 
      prior to the reopening of markets on Monday, September 17. In explaining 
      that action, the FOMC pointed both to a less sanguine economic outlook and 
      to significant uncertainties (downside risks) associated with that outlook. 
      The minutes from the FOMC&#8217;s August 2001 meeting (which included a 
      summary of the FOMC teleconference call held on the morning of the September 
      17th ) reported:
        
      <blockquote> &#8220;Subsequently, on September 17, 2001, the Committee members 
        voted unanimously to ease reserve conditions appreciably further, consistent 
        with a reduction in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points to a level 
        of 3 percent. This policy action was associated with the approval by the 
        Board of Governors of a reduction of equal size in the discount rate to 
        a level of 2-1/2 percent. <em>These actions were taken against the backdrop 
        of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist 
        attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the 
        performance of the economy</em>. In conjunction with these policy moves, 
        the Federal Reserve would continue to supply, as needed, an atypically 
        large volume of liquidity to the financial system. As a consequence, the 
        Committee recognized that the federal funds rate might fall below its 
        target on occasion until more normal conditions were restored in the functioning 
        of the financial system. The Committee's vote encompassed the retention 
        of a statement in its press release indicating that the balance of risks 
        remained weighted toward weakness for the foreseeable future.&#8221; [emphasis 
        added] </blockquote>
      <p>The September 11 attacks also provided an example of the way in which 
        the Federal Reserve employed its full range of policy tools to address 
        risks to the forecast. On the morning of September 11, the Federal Reserve 
        issued a brief public statement indicating that it was operating and that 
        the discount window was available. With an important market mechanism 
        for distributing reserves among banks&#8212;the brokered federal funds 
        market&#8212;significantly impaired, there were huge imbalances in reserve 
        positions across the banking system. These were met through extraordinarily 
        large levels of discount window lending for a few days and also by huge 
        injections of reserves via the open market desk. A sizable portion of 
        the funding needs on some days was concentrated at foreign banking organizations. 
        To allow foreign central banks to better meet the dollar-denominated funding 
        needs of their institutions, the Federal Reserve arranged swap lines with 
        the ECB and the Bank of England and expanded its existing swap line with 
        the Bank of Canada. To augment bank liquidity further, the Federal Reserve 
        waived all daylight overdraft fees and the penalty portion of charges 
        for overnight overdrafts and lengthened Fedwire operating hours for several 
        days after the attacks. The Federal Reserve also greatly eased the limits 
        on its security lending facility, thereby helping to reduce the pressure 
        firms faced in acquiring securities made scarce by settlement difficulties. 
        In addition, as noted earlier, the federal banking regulators issued a 
        joint statement recognizing the possibility of significant balance sheet 
        expansion for some banks and suggesting that banks contact them if they 
        had concerns about how this would affect their capital ratios. These temporary 
        arrangements were gradually unwound as financial conditions returned to 
        normal.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Conclusion</strong><br>
        Financial stability is and always will be of vital interest to central 
        banks and is certainly an appropriate objective for central banks. There 
        are some complexities, however, in determining just how financial stability 
        considerations should be taken into account in reaching policy decisions. 
        In this context, the Federal Reserve has found it useful to view financial 
        stability in terms of its impact on the economic outlook, including its 
        effects on the forecasts for key economic variables and the risks to those 
        forecasts. Much of the discussion above was framed in terms of an individual 
        central bank balancing concerns about domestic financial stability with 
        other objectives. But in today&#8217;s globally integrated markets, it 
        is more important than ever for central banks and other financial authorities 
        to share information, to communicate about crisis prevention measures, 
        and to recognize a common interest in effective crisis management actions. 
        In this vein, the work being done in various forums to develop a deeper 
        understanding of the international dimensions of financial instability 
        and to foster important structural improvements in areas such as payment 
        systems, banking and securities market regulations, and accounting standards 
        is especially important and relevant. </p>

      <p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Svensson (2002) argues that optimal policy is based 
        predominantly on an evaluation of forecasts for output and inflation and 
        that financial stability is best viewed as a constraint on policy that 
        becomes binding only on occasion. The FOMC tends to follow a more nuanced 
        approach in which an assessment of the asymmetries in the outlook is part 
        of its normal deliberations. Such risks sometimes include discussions 
        of various types of financial imbalances. <a href="#f7">Return to text</a>
