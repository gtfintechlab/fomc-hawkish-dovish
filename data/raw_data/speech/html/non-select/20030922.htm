	<p> I am pleased to be here today as you begin your meetings that relate to 
        a wide range of retail banking issues. The breadth and scope of the topics 
        to be addressed at this conference reflect the rate of change in the banking 
        industry, as well as the ever-increasing role of the consumer in this 
        industry. Certainly, the world of financial services has transformed since 
        I began my banking career nearly forty years ago. Perhaps even more remarkable 
        is the pace at which these changes have occurred, with many taking place 
        over the course of the past decade. Technology, deregulation, and product 
        innovation have redefined the way in which financial institutions conduct 
        every aspect of their business, from originating loans to delivering products 
        and services. Today, I would like to offer some compelling information 
        on the nature and scope of these changes, as well as their impact on the 
        availability of financial services to consumers. Finally, I will address 
        how the current marketplace for financial services has brought about shared 
        responsibilities and increased opportunities for the users, providers, 
        advocates, and regulators of financial services. 
      <p>Although my topic today is somewhat more broad than the general theme 
        of this conference, I believe it is appropriate for two reasons. First, 
        your industry is in continual evolution and I want to give this group 
        the benefit of the implications of these changes from my vantage point. 
        Second, marketplace changes often generate either new regulations or suggestions 
        for new regulations. The collective response of your members to these 
        changes may well help determine the agenda topics for future meetings 
        of this group. 
      <p><strong>Evolution of the Consumer Financial Services Industry </strong><br>
        Many of the changes in the delivery and production of financial services 
        are directly attributable to advances in technology and telecommunications. 
        Just as it has in nearly every other area of the economy, technological 
        progress has dramatically increased organizational efficiency and enhanced 
        consumer convenience in the financial services industry. Take, for example, 
        automated teller machines (ATMs), which emerged about twenty years ago 
        as one of the first means for electronic service delivery in banking. 
        Today, ATMs are ubiquitous and continue to gain acceptance by consumers. 
        Data from the Federal Reserve's most recent Survey of Consumer Finances 
        (SCF) indicate that 57 percent of families with banking relationships 
        use ATMs to access their accounts, a proportion that increased by nearly 
        67 percent from 1995. Similarly, consumers have increased their usage 
        of automated clearinghouse services, with the number of families using 
        electronic deposit and debit services increasing by about 20 percentage 
        points between 1995 and 2001. In addition, consumer use of computers to 
        conduct financial activities continues to grow in popularity: The 2001 
        SCF data revealed that 19 percent of families accessed at least one of 
        their accounts via the Internet, which is five times more than the number 
        of families responding to this question on the 1995 SCF. 
      <p>Technological advances in account access and processing mechanisms have 
        had considerable impact on the delivery of financial services. However, 
        the development of credit scoring technology has had the most significant 
        effect on the evolution of the financial services industry. The widespread 
        use of computer models to evaluate and predict credit risk has had a tremendous 
        impact on institutions' ability to reduce underwriting costs and has increased 
        opportunities for identifying new customers. Because of the efficiencies 
        and consistency in risk profiling that credit scoring offers, creditors 
        have continually sought to apply this technology to new areas of lending. 
        The use of credit scoring models has migrated from its origins in unsecured 
        consumer credit to its application in mortgage lending and, more recently, 
        small business credit and insurance underwriting. In addition, the use 
        of credit scoring technology has created other important efficiencies 
        within the industry, most notably, enabling lenders to more effectively 
        price for risk and package loans for sale in the secondary market. The 
        use of credit scoring technology has made the credit approval process 
        increasingly impersonal. At the same time, however, credit approvals are 
        increasingly age- race- and gender-blind, which has contributed to what 
        my predecessor Federal Reserve Board member Lawrence Lindsey referred 
        to as the "democratization" of credit. 
      <p>Coinciding with the technological advancements, significant policy changes 
        have contributed to greater efficiency and competition in the financial 
        services market. Low interest rates have increased the affordability of 
        credit, and deregulation has significantly broadened the number of credit-product 
        providers. In fact, the number of sources for credit now available to 
        consumers is so broad that it is difficult to quantify. In a recent effort 
        to identify the number of institutions offering credit in today's marketplace, 
        Federal Reserve Board staff estimated that more than 75,000 lending institutions 
        extend consumer credit, ranging from banks and credit unions to mortgage 
        companies and payday lenders. 
      <p><strong>Impact of Industry Changes on Consumers </strong><br>
        The culmination of improvements in information processing technology, 
        product innovation, the relaxation of regulatory restrictions, and enhanced 
        competition has helped lower costs and increase accessibility to credit. 
        The expansion of the consumer lending market has created new opportunities 
        for households to match their short-term spending needs with their longer-term 
        stream of income, helping them to achieve their broader financial and 
        life goals. Consumers who have traditionally had difficulty gaining access 
        to credit from mainstream financial institutions have particularly benfitted. 
        Over the past two decades, the proportion of households using credit has 
        risen dramatically. Evidence from the Federal Reserve's SCF shows that 
        the proportion of all households with outstanding debt increased 5 
        percentage points between 1983 and 2001. During the same time, the median 
        debt level of households more than doubled, to about $40,000, with most 
        of this volume increase relating to mortgage debt. 
      <p>The SCF findings indicate that one result of the ongoing financial-market 
        changes has been the democratization of credit. A review of the use of 
        credit across income groups over the past two decades shows the level 
        of debt has increased sharply in all income groups, and the median level 
        of debt has doubled for each group. Notably, the strongest growth in the 
        proportion of families having any debt occurred in the lowest two quintiles 
        of the income distribution, with the proportion increasing by about 20 
        percent in each group. 
      <p>Given such trends, some observers have expressed concern that recent 
        increases in the use of credit among lower-income and less financially 
        sophisticated households could lead to financial distress for these possibly 
        more vulnerable households. However, data from the SCF may alleviate some 
        of these concerns. Over the 1992-2001 interval, households' payment-to-income 
        ratio, an expression of debt burden, increased by less than a percentage 
        point at the median. Although this ratio grew more strongly in the lowest-income 
        bracket, by 4 percentage points, the most recent level for lower-income 
        households is still not much higher than that for all households. 
      <p>Perhaps more revealing as an indicator of financial distress is the proportion 
        of households with very high debt burdens--that is, those households dedicating 
        more than 40 percent of their income to debt payment. This measure rose 
        only slightly over the period for debtor households overall, as well as 
        for lower-income debtors. However, the proportion of low-income debtor 
        households with high payment burdens was more than two times higher than 
        that of all debtor households. A similar picture emerges from the examination 
        of the incidence of late payments. The SCF data show an increase of 1 
        percentage point in the frequency of late payments made by all debtor 
        households from 1992 to 2001. The rate of late payments by low-income 
        debtor households increased by 2.4 percentage points during this time 
        frame, and the rate of payments late by sixty days or more was nearly 
        twice as high for lower-income households. Although these financial struggles 
        are very difficult for the households involved, it is important to bear 
        in mind that such late-payment performance is a pressing problem for only 
        a small proportion of overall debtors in any given year. 
      <p>More important than just knowing the increased levels of debt that have 
        resulted from the democratization of credit is understanding how access 
        to credit has increased households' capacity for achieving asset accumulation. 
        Home ownership, of course, is perhaps the best illustration of how access 
        to credit can create new wealth-building opportunities. The 2001 SCF data 
        show that the percentage of families owning their primary residence increased 
        by 1.5 percentage points since 1998. Similarly, gains in home ownership 
        in the two lowest income groups increased by 1.8 and 2.0 percentage points, 
        respectively. The benefits that the democratization of credit have conveyed 
        can also be seen by looking at the growth in consumers' holdings of nonmonetary 
        assets, including homes, automobiles, and businesses. Between 1983 and 
        2001, the percentage of all families holding these assets increased by 
        6.4 percentage points. More noteworthy is the proportion of families in 
        the lowest income category owning such assets--this group grew by 16.4 
        percentage points during this time, more than 2.5 times the rate for all 
        families. 
      <p><strong>Role of Consumers in Retail Banking Portfolios </strong><br>
        Given the proliferation of consumer products and the democratization of 
        credit, it comes as no surprise that consumers account for an increasing 
        share of assets and profits for commercial banks, which experienced a 
        three-decade high in return on assets in 2002. Household borrowing was 
        a significant contributor to banks' positive financial performance last 
        year, particularly in residential mortgage lending. For commercial banks, 
        this asset class grew by 20 percent in 2002, and home equity loans expanded 
        by nearly 40 percent. Further, consumer installment loans in commercial 
        bank portfolios grew by 7.3 percent. Consumer activity also contributed 
        significantly to banks' profit margins in 2002. Fees generated by mortgage 
        lending was a factor in the 6.6 percent growth in non-interest income 
        by banks last year, while revenue generated from deposit accounts expanded 
        at a double-digit rate for the third consecutive year. 
      <p>Data on the increasing level of consumer financial activity and its positive 
        impact for both households and banking institutions demonstrate the mutually 
        beneficial relationship that exists between consumers and retail banking 
        institutions. Such information also underscores that, in today's current 
        market, the success of consumers and the performance of financial institutions 
        are directly correlated. As credit use by consumers continues to grow 
        to historically high levels, and as bank profits associated with consumer 
        lending reach new heights, concerns over the potential negative side effects 
        of the democratization of credit are likely to grow as well. Further, 
        the financial stability of consumers and banks has tremendous implications 
        for the success of communities and markets. With such broad consequences 
        come widespread responsibilities for facilitating efficiency and effectiveness 
        in the retail financial services market. As such, I believe that there 
        are four points of responsibility for ensuring positive outcomes in consumers' 
        financial experiences: (1) the consumer, (2) financial service providers, 
        (3) community groups, and (4) regulators. 
      <p><strong>Relationship between Innovation and Education </strong><br>
        As history has shown, the rate of change and the pace of innovation will 
        only continue to increase within consumer retail markets. This is true 
        of retail financial markets as well. The net result of these changes is 
        that an ever-increasing number of consumers will be able to access an 
        ever-increasing number of financial products. That scenario suggests both 
        increasing benefit and increasing risk for consumers of financial products. 
        When they are appropriately evaluated and used financial products allow 
        an increasing number of people to achieve financial goals previously considered 
        out of reach. In contrast, inappropriate or careless use of financial 
        products can put a consumer in a deep financial hole from which it can 
        be both difficult and time consuming to recover. 
      <p>The weight of the responsibility for supervising one's personal financial 
        circumstances is enormous and unrelenting. Consumers must be vigilant 
        in revisiting their decisions, reassessing priorities as their life circumstances 
        change, and modifying their strategy accordingly. Consumers should regard 
        access to credit as one of their most valuable assets and take care not 
        to abuse or overuse it, so that credit will be available to them as they 
        seek to realize future financial and life goals. 
      <p>The second point of responsibility in consumer markets resides with financial 
        service providers. With the myriad of products and services available, 
        the financial service providers offer the most sophisticated retail goods 
        in the service sector. Consequently, both banks and nonbanks bear a fundamental 
        duty to provide consumers with information that accurately represents 
        the terms and conditions associated with their products and should take 
        care to avoid deceptive language in marketing materials. In addition, 
        financial service providers have an implicit obligation to serve customers 
        in good faith by extending products that are appropriate to their financial 
        position. For example, granting a loan to an uncreditworthy borrower has 
        negative consequences for both the customer and the creditor. Today, many 
        consumers, including college students, are inundated with offers for credit, 
        ranging from direct mail solicitations to store sales promotions. Lenders 
        must remain committed to due diligence and underwriting standards that 
        will result in reasonable levels of debt for a consumer. In their efforts 
        to bolster profits generated from fee-based products and services, financial 
        service providers should be mindful of associated consumer protection 
        implications when pricing their products. Many benefits can accrue to 
        institutions that are attentive to their customers, whether institutions 
        seek to enter new markets, such as immigrant populations in which language 
        and cultural considerations present new challenges, or when institutions 
        seek to deepen their financial relationships with existing customers. 
        In addition, acting in good faith can reduce the likelihood of new regulatory 
        requirements designed to ensure fair practices. 
      <p>The third point of responsibility in the oversight of the consumer financial 
        services market resides with consumer and community groups. With close 
        ties to their constituencies, these groups are uniquely positioned to 
        understand the needs for financial products and services and to aid in 
        the development of products to meet them. Their mission to increase opportunities 
        for economic success in their neighborhoods makes community groups effective 
        advocates to ensure that economic opportunities are extended to groups 
        that are often underrepresented and underserved. Over the past 30 years, 
        these organizations have been instrumental in helping lower-income families 
        purchase homes, start businesses, and accumulate savings to help them 
        gain control of their personal finances. As credit becomes more readily 
        available in previously underserved markets, community groups should help 
        respond to the corresponding need for greater financial education.
      <p> The final point of responsibility lies with the agencies that regulate 
        financial service providers. Given their perspective and authority, regulators 
        play an essential role in ensuring that pertinent and accurate information 
        is provided to consumers who are contracting for financial services. In 
        performing this role, the goal is also to help consumers understand the 
        fundamental aspects and implications of financial transactions, including 
        their associated costs and contractual terms. By defining standard terminology, 
        regulators enable consumers to comparison shop for their financial services. 
        By establishing the boundaries of acceptable practices and taking action 
        against institutions that violate these standards, regulators help protect 
        consumers from unfair and unscrupulous policies. For financial institutions, 
        agencies offer guidance that assists them in developing policies and products 
        that are safe and sound and fair to consumers. With concern for the viability 
        of financial institutions and the well-being of consumers, regulators 
        seek to create regulations, policies, and guidance that achieve adequate 
        protection for consumers without creating undue regulatory burden that 
        could restrict the provision of credit and other banking services. 
      <p>Specific regulatory and supervisory actions taken in recent years demonstrate 
        how these tools are applied to address both consumer protection and safety-and-soundness 
        issues. In response to increased concerns about abusive lending practices 
        in the home equity market and the detrimental impact they have on consumers, 
        the Federal Reserve amended regulations implementing the Home Ownership 
        Equity and Protection Act (HOEPA) and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 
        (HMDA). HOEPA's provisions are triggered by high rates or fees, and changes 
        in the regulation have increased the number of high-cost loans subject 
        to the law, required additional disclosures to consumers, and prohibited 
        the use of certain contract provisions. Recent HMDA amendments require 
        the reporting of pricing data on loans with rates that exceed a level 
        defined by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as require the identification 
        of loans subject to HOEPA. The collection of these data will enable regulators 
        to gain new insight into trends in subprime lending and conduct research 
        on the implications of the cost of credit for various groups and communities. 
      <p>In addition, interagency guidance was issued to banks on managing risks 
        relating to subprime and credit card lending. The guidance issued on subprime 
        lending clarifies the characteristics of a subprime loan program and what 
        factors should be considered in determining adequate capital levels to 
        support subprime lending. A list of potentially predatory or abusive lending 
        practices that could be subject to criticism by examiners is also provided. 
        In managing an institution's risk profile for credit card lending, the 
        agencies have stipulated that bank management should adopt policies and 
        procedures that consider the repayment capacity of borrowers, direct the 
        timely repayment of over-limit amounts, and require minimum payments that 
        will amortize the current balance over a reasonable period of time. 
      <p>The four points of responsibility for consumers' financial experiences 
        I've discussed bring about a dynamic, productive tension within our banking 
        system. While the tension among these four groups can be contentious at 
        times, effective collaborations often emerge that result in positive outcomes 
        for consumers, financial institutions, and markets. The topic of financial 
        education is one example of how cooperation and partnership among all 
        of these parties has increased the resources devoted to improving consumer 
        financial literacy. 
      <p>In recent years, the importance of financial education has received increasing 
        attention from policymakers and consumer interest organizations. High-profile 
        consumer issues, such as predatory lending and the record levels of personal 
        bankruptcy filings, have illustrated the devastating consequences that 
        abusive and inappropriate contract terms, coupled with insufficient financial 
        acumen, can have on individuals and families. As a result, many effective 
        initiatives and collaborations by the stakeholders that I noted previously 
        have been established to help increase the availability of financial education 
        resources. Results of a recent survey conducted by the Consumer Bankers 
        Association indicate that 98 percent of the banks responding to the survey 
        sponsor or support financial literacy programs that range from mortgage 
        and home ownership counseling to efforts to combat predatory lending and 
        assist unbanked populations. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition, 
        a community advocacy organization, has undertaken a financial literacy 
        campaign in partnership with banks to provide materials and training to 
        community leaders, bankers, and government agencies to further financial 
        education for adults, youth, and businesses in lower-income neighborhoods. 
        Other nonprofit organizations, such as the Jump$tart Coalition and the 
        National Endowment for Financial Education, actively promote financial 
        education to youth through collaborations with schools. The Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Corporation developed a comprehensive financial education curriculum 
        that it offers to organizations seeking to provide training courses to 
        their audiences. This past spring, the Federal Reserve launched a national 
        financial education awareness campaign in both English and Spanish that 
        includes a public service announcement, a brochure highlighting fundamental 
        strategies to improve financial behavior, and a web site to help consumers 
        identify additional education and information resources. 
      <p>These activities represent only a small variety of the financial education 
        efforts under way throughout the country. Many other organizations and 
        partnerships that have embraced their responsibility to further financial 
        education and are providing critical support to consumers. All of these 
        efforts make an important contribution to the ongoing evolution of the 
        financial services industry by creating informed and educated customers 
        who can effectively choose and demand products that further their economic 
        and life goals. 
      <p>As you begin your meetings, I urge you to think creatively about ways 
        to leverage your role by capitalizing on the responsibility of the other 
        players in this industry and in your communities. As we have seen happen 
        in financial education efforts, tapping into the commitment of each group--consumers, 
        financial institutions, consumer groups, and regulators--can result in 
        new opportunities for all. </TD>
