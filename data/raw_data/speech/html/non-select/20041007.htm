<p>The role of trade
in the U.S. economy has moved well into the spotlight in recent years, and I am
pleased to be here today to share my thoughts on this important topic with such
distinguished and knowledgeable colleagues. Over the course of this day, you
will be hearing from leading analysts, policymakers, and commentators about
recent developments in the U.S. economy, past and prospective trends in job
creation, the role of sourcing (both out- and in-), and the implications of
trade for the coming elections. In my remarks this morning, I would like to
put these issues into the broader context of the debate over free trade and its
implications for the American economy.</p>

<p>Though my focus
will be on free trade, we must remember that prospects for the average American
depend on many other factors as well, including technological progress, the
education required to exploit this progress, a dynamic market-oriented economy,
a framework of limited but effective regulation, healthy and well-governed
financial institutions, and a stable macroeconomic environment. And free trade
is not necessarily the most important item on this list. Even so, it has been
a focus of interest and aspiration for economists dating back to Adam Smith and
David Ricardo. As you know, finding overwhelming agreement on issues is
difficult among economists, but free trade is an exception.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p> The supporters of free
trade have not been ignored. In the past half-century, global trade has become
freer and has expanded rapidly. The ratio of trade (exports plus imports) to
worldwide gross domestic product rose from only 16 percent in 1960 to 40
percent by 2001. In 1960, the United States, Germany, and Japan had average
tariff rates of around 7 percent; these rates were more than halved by 1993.
The number of members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), or its
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, rose from 18 in 1948
to 146 in 2003, and the number of regional trade agreements in the world ballooned
from only 1 in 1958 to 161 in 2003.</p>

<p>Although most
economists welcome these trends, the public at large has been much more
ambivalent about international trade. Attitudes toward free trade in principle
remain generally positive, but a substantial--and, perhaps, growing--minority
of Americans hold more negative views. According to a poll completed around
the beginning of this year, 41 percent of respondents viewed the process of increasing
international trade through reduction of barriers as proceeding too quickly;
this number was up from 30 percent in 1999. And 43 percent of respondents
believed that the government should try to slow or reverse the expansion of
international trade, up from 39 percent in 1999.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a></p>

<p>What accounts for
the apparent deterioration in public support for free trade over the past five
years? The widening of the U.S. trade deficit may have exacerbated concerns
about the country's international competitiveness. More important, some have
blamed overseas competition for the job losses associated with the economic slowdown
earlier in this decade.</p>

<p>Without solid
public support for free trade, achieving continued progress in reducing
protectionist barriers, both at home and abroad, may become more difficult. In
the remainder of my remarks, I'd like to review the arguments for and against
free trade, explore why it has been difficult to muster more widespread public
support for this goal, and address some of the consequences of trade protection
as it has been implemented in practice.</p>

<p><b>Arguments
for Free Trade</b><br>International trade contributes to prosperity and growth through several
channels. These channels are not especially subtle or esoteric, and I would
argue that the public at large understands them reasonably well. At the same
time, however, quantifying the contributions of trade to national welfare is by
no means straightforward.</p>

<p>First, and most
obviously, trade increases the variety of goods available to consumers. Trade
provides some products that otherwise would be beyond the reach of most
American households, such as roses for Valentine's Day, or peaches and
nectarines during the winter. More generally, international trade allows us to
choose from a wider array of goods than would otherwise be available: Japanese
and German cars in addition to American, Chilean apples as well as Washington
state, French and Australian wine as well as Californian. It is difficult to
put a dollar figure on the value of this increased variety to the consumer, but
estimates range as high as nearly 3 percent of GDP.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a></p>

<p>A second benefit
of international trade is its role in reducing the cost of goods and hence in
raising our standard of living. To anyone who has walked into a large discount
store and surveyed the range of low-priced items produced in any number of
distant economies, this benefit is abundantly clear. However, actually
measuring the extent to which trade holds down consumer costs is tricky.
Between 1990 and 2003, for example, the overall consumer price index rose 41
percent, whereas prices declined for many highly traded goods, including toys
(whose prices fell 26 percent), televisions (53 percent), and clocks and lamps
(15 percent); in just the past five years, the price of telephones,
calculators, and other such items has fallen 42 percent. Yet, we do not know
how much of the decline in these prices can be attributed to trade, as most
traded products are manufactures and are subject to greater productivity growth
(and hence steeper declines in costs) than nontraded products such as
services. </p>

<p>A more fruitful
approach may be to compare the prices of goods that are protected from
international competition with what they would be in the absence of such
barriers. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission indicates
that sectoral trade liberalization would lower the price of sugar for U.S.
consumers by 8 percent, of apparel by 5 percent, and of footwear and leather
products by 4 percent.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> Clearly, if
international trade were curtailed for a much broader range of goods, the cost
of living for American workers would be higher and the standard of living
correspondingly lower.</p>

<p>A third key
benefit of free trade is that it allows economies to specialize in the activities
they do best. This notion was at the core of the classical economists' defense
of free trade. By allowing England to specialize in cloth production and
Portugal in wine, for example, international commerce leads to a higher income
for both countries than if each tried to produce both goods for themselves. By
the same token, no American today would object to trade between Massachusetts
and Montana, or between Alaska and Alabama--the various U.S. states obviously
have their own comparative advantages in producing a variety of different
products, and trade among them makes such specialization possible. Extending
the example of trade among states to trade among countries is not much of a
stretch.</p>

<p>Can we measure the
extent to which the specialization associated with free trade may boost incomes
and welfare? Such an estimate is obviously no simple thing to calculate.
Economists frequently use so-called computable general equilibrium models,
often consisting of hundreds of equations, to address this issue. A recent
analysis of the effects of past trade liberalizations on the U.S. economy puts
the gains to U.S. welfare at about 1/2 percent of GDP.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>
A separate analysis of a hypothetical 33 percent reduction in trade barriers
around the world suggests it would raise welfare by 1-1/2 percent of global
GDP.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a></p>

<p>In addition to
promoting specialization, trade boosts productivity through a fourth channel of
influence: opening the economy to heightened competition. This effect could
occur either as firms are spurred by foreign competitors to become more
efficient, or as the least productive firms are forced to close, thus raising
the average level of productivity for the economy as a whole. Again, most
Americans likely recognize the importance of competition in boosting
performance--the ascendancy of Japanese automobiles, for example, has been
cited as a factor that has spurred Detroit to greater innovation and better
quality. By heightening competitive forces and thus incentives for
productivity and innovation, international trade has likely accelerated the
process of &quot;creative destruction&quot; by which outdated and less
productive activities are replaced by new technologies and more dynamic
enterprises.</p>

<p>Academic research
supports the view that import competition has led U.S. manufacturing firms to
become more capital intensive;<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a> trade
liberalization apparently has enhanced productivity in some import-competing
firms in foreign countries as well.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a> Producing for
export markets may also yield dividends: Research suggests that exporters are
more productive than non-exporters in the same industry and that they grow more
rapidly as well.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a> Finally,
many studies suggest that countries that are more open to international trade
have enjoyed higher rates of economic growth.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a>
Our sad experience after adoption of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, as well
as the record of Latin America, India, and other regions that experimented with
&quot;import-substituting industrialization,&quot; point to the deterioration
in economic performance that occurs when countries erect barriers to trade.<a href="#fn11" title="footnote 11"><sup>11</sup></a><a name="f11"></a>
</p>

<p><b>Arguments against Free Trade</b><br>If the benefits
conferred by international trade are reasonably straightforward, how can we
explain the apparent ambivalence toward trade picked up by recent surveys? Clearly,
many people view the benefits of free trade as being outweighed by its
perceived costs. </p>

<p>One concern about
free trade may be that it has given rise to large trade and current account
deficits, thereby adding to the nation's debt and putting future prosperity at
risk. Now at more than 5 percent of GDP, the current account deficit is in
record territory, it is growing, and it cannot be sustained indefinitely. We
cannot foresee when the deficit will stop growing and return to
more-sustainable levels, through what mechanisms this adjustment will occur, or
whether this adjustment will be smooth or disruptive for financial markets and
the economy more generally. No matter how a correction of the external
imbalance proceeds, however, it will involve a range of adjustments to
investment, saving, and asset prices, both for the U.S. economy and for our
trading partners. Research suggests that past corrections of large external
imbalances in industrial countries generally have occurred without crisis.<a href="#fn12" title="footnote 12"><sup>12</sup></a><a name="f12"></a>
Whether or not this will remain the case, I am confident that protectionism is
not the appropriate response to our growing current account deficit. The
amount of current account adjustment that would be gained from a given
tightening of import controls is questionable. Yet, it is certain that such
actions would impose costs on the economy that would persist long after
concerns about the deficit dissipated. </p>

<p>A second concern
about free trade that is frequently voiced, and probably a more important one
to many people, is that trade destroys American jobs and creates unemployment.
The same survey I mentioned earlier, showing a deterioration in general
attitudes toward trade, also indicated that 40 percent of respondents believed
that trade barriers should be maintained because of the threat to U.S. jobs, up
from 31 percent in 1999.<a href="#fn13" title="footnote 13"><sup>13</sup></a><a name="f13"></a></p>

<p>It is worth
distinguishing among several variants of the concern about trade and jobs. The
first variant holds that the rise in imports lowers employment and raises the
unemployment rate by shifting jobs overseas. This claim is strongly
contradicted both by theory and by experience. Make no mistake: Import
competition clearly has cost some American workers their jobs and has caused
them considerable hardship as a result. However, economywide equilibrating
forces, including monetary policy, ensure that over time such employment losses
are offset by gains elsewhere in the economy, so that the nationwide
unemployment rate averages around its equilibrium level. In fact, the inflow
of foreign capital that finances our trade deficit provides the funding for
investment projects that employ U.S. workers just as surely as does any other
productive activity in the economy. Between 1960 and 2003, the trade balance
moved from a slight surplus to a deficit of 4-1/2 percent of GDP, and nominal
imports rose from about 4 percent of GDP to 14 percent--yet, the current
unemployment rate of about 5-1/2 percent is little changed from its 1960 level,
while nonfarm private employment has grown by more than 60 million jobs.<a href="#fn14" title="footnote 14"><sup>14</sup></a><a name="f14"></a></p>

<p>It has also been
suggested that import competition has caused a significant portion of the
decline in employment since the recession of 2001. Yet, the ratio of the
nominal trade deficit to GDP widened less than 1 percentage point between 2000
and 2003. Moreover, this deterioration came entirely from a decline in the ratio
of exports to GDP, from 11.2 percent in 2000 to 9.5 percent in 2003; the ratio
of imports to GDP actually declined about 1 percentage point over this period.
</p>

<p>A second variant
of the concern over trade and jobs is certainly valid: Import competition can
be highly disruptive and cause considerable pain for those who lose their
jobs. One study of worker displacement indicates that only about two-thirds of
displaced workers found another job within three years, and even when they were
successful in finding full-time work, the earnings of these workers on average
declined 8 percent.<a href="#fn15" title="footnote 15"><sup>15</sup></a><a name="f15"></a> Another
study found that job losers in industries facing heavy import competition were
slightly less likely to be reemployed, and suffered greater earnings losses,
than workers who lost their jobs in industries facing less import competition.<a href="#fn16" title="footnote 16"><sup>16</sup></a><a name="f16"></a></p>

<p>We cannot and
should not minimize the hardships of workers displaced by imports. However, we
must also keep in mind that their numbers are relatively small compared with
either the total labor force or even the total number of jobs lost in the
United States. Estimates of the gross number of jobs lost to imports vary, but
one representative estimate puts them at a bit more than 300,000 per year
during the 1980s and 1990s.<a href="#fn17" title="footnote 17"><sup>17</sup></a><a name="f17"></a> This
number, while hardly negligible, is dwarfed by the roughly 15 million job
losses estimated to occur each year in the United States. As our dynamic
market economy evolves, it generates substantial churning in labor markets as
jobs are gained in some sectors and lost in others; jobs gained and lost
because of trade are only a small part of that process. </p>

<p>It is
understandable that concerns about job losses from import competition may
extend far beyond their actual incidence in the labor market, given more
general anxieties about employment security among American workers. However,
to echo a point that has been made before, the proper response to the
disruptions associated with trade is not to reduce trade, but rather to
ameliorate the pain associated with those disruptions through enhanced
assistance and retraining for displaced workers.</p>

<p>A final concern
about trade that I would like to discuss is that import competition, whether or
not it affects the number of jobs, shifts the employment mix from high-quality
jobs to low-quality jobs. For example, critics have long held that international
trade pushes workers out of manufacturing jobs and into less desirable service-sector
jobs. However, no conclusive evidence has shown that, over the long haul, the
service jobs being created pay less or are otherwise less desirable than
manufactured jobs being displaced. Moreover, the declining share of
manufacturing in U.S. employment most likely stems less from import competition
than it does from the rapid pace of productivity growth in manufacturing; this
growth outpaced the productivity growth of the overall economy by about 1-1/4 percentage
points annually from 1973 to 1994 and by 1-1/2 percentage points from 1994 to
2000. The higher rate of productivity growth in manufacturing has restrained
both price increases and employment in the sector, thus leading the services
area of the economy to expand its share of spending and jobs. This phenomenon
is hardly unique to the United States--the share of manufacturing has declined
in most of our major foreign trading partners as well.</p>

<p>More recently, the
outsourcing of service jobs to developing countries has come under the
spotlight. The increasing use of computer programming talent in India and
other low-wage countries has, understandably, struck a chord of anxiety among
American workers. For years, the response of pro-trade advocates to the loss
of low-wage jobs in manufacturing has been that they are being made up by the
creation of higher-paid, higher-skilled jobs in the service sector. The loss
of highly paid programming jobs to lower-paid workers abroad now appears to
suggest that there is no place where American workers can hold their own. </p>

<p>Yet, as in the
case of import competition more generally, we must not exaggerate the
importance of outsourcing to the nation's overall employment picture. There
are no conclusive data, but a prominent study puts the number of jobs displaced
through services outsourcing over the next decade or so at fewer than 300,000
annually, or less than 2 percent of the 15 million in total gross job losses I
noted earlier.<a href="#fn18" title="footnote 18"><sup>18</sup></a><a name="f18"></a> Moreover,
only a fraction of those jobs represent high-skilled, high-wage jobs; these
numbers are quite difficult to pin down, but one study puts the number of
software jobs lost to India since 2000 at fewer than 50,000 annually.<a href="#fn19" title="footnote 19"><sup>19</sup></a><a name="f19"></a>
Finally, we should remember that the United States gains jobs through what is
often referred to as &quot;insourcing,&quot; that is, performing service jobs
for other countries. In fact, the United States has consistently run a surplus
in those categories of the balance-of-payments associated with trade in
business services.</p>

<p>Turning from the
sectoral job mix to the impact of import competition on wages, the evidence is
particularly unclear. Some studies have suggested that import competition from
low-wage countries has depressed wages for low-skilled workers relative to
those for higher-skilled workers in recent decades. However, other studies
have argued that the rise in skill premiums is attributable to technological
developments that have raised relative demands for educated workers. Focusing
on the past few years, we see no consensus on how the mix of low- and high-wage
jobs in the economy has evolved; estimates are extremely sensitive to the
definition of job classes, the source of data, the time period, and method of
calculation. In any event, it is doubtful that changes in the pattern of wages
in the U.S. economy can be explained by any single factor--trends in trade, in
population and immigration, in unionization and labor market competition, in
minimum wage policy, in the skill mix of the labor force, and in technology all
play a role.</p>

<p><b>Drawbacks of Protectionism</b><br>To sum up the
discussion so far, the public likely has a reasonably good grasp of the
benefits of free trade. It is the perceived drawbacks to international trade
that probably account for the ambivalence indicated in opinion surveys. Some
of these fears may be overstated--for example, the claim that imports lower
aggregate employment. But other concerns cannot be dismissed out of
hand--especially the claim that trade leads to disruptions for some workers.
Balancing the pain for a few against the lasting gains for the economy as a
whole, economists generally view the latter as outweighing the former, but it
is admittedly difficult for many individuals in American society to share this
assessment.</p>

<p>Rather than
arguing the merits of international trade in the abstract, advocates of free
trade might gain more traction by arguing against concrete examples of
protectionism. Each year brings new actions by the U.S. government to protect
individual sectors from imports. Antidumping duties are imposed when domestic
industry is believed to be injured by the sale of imported goods at less than &quot;fair
value.&quot; Countervailing duties are intended to counteract subsidies to
foreign producers. Safeguard actions are intended to protect a domestic
industry that has been seriously injured by a surge in imports.<a href="#fn20" title="footnote 20"><sup>20</sup></a><a name="f20"></a>
As of August 2004, 359 antidumping and countervailing duty orders were in place
in the United States against imports from 51 countries.<a href="#fn21" title="footnote 21"><sup>21</sup></a><a name="f21"></a></p>

<p>By discouraging
unfair commercial practices, such actions, in principle, promote a more stable
and competitive environment for international trade. In practice, identifying
anticompetitive practices is a murky process. For example, in antidumping
cases, determining the &quot;fair value&quot; of a good may involve a degree of
discretion, thereby complicating the assessment of whether foreign goods are
being sold below their appropriate price.<a href="#fn22" title="footnote 22"><sup>22</sup></a><a name="f22"></a>
Domestic producers have a strong incentive to lobby for trade actions
regardless of whether such actions are merited. </p>

<p>Because they
inhibit free trade, protectionist actions have an array of adverse consequences
that one would expect: They reduce variety and raise costs for consumers; they
distort the allocation of resources in the economy by encouraging excessive
resources to flow into protected sectors; and they foster inefficiency by
reducing the extent of competition. Perhaps more important in the eyes of the
public, however, may be several related and highly egregious consequences of
protectionist actions. </p>

<p>First, by raising
the cost of goods that are inputs for other producers, import barriers may
destroy more jobs in so-called &quot;downstream&quot; sectors than they save in
protected sectors. According to one study, the 2002 steel safeguard program
contributed to higher steel prices that eliminated about 200,000 jobs in steel-<i>using</i>
industries, whereas only 187,500 workers were employed by U.S. steel-<i>producers</i>
in December 2002.<a href="#fn23" title="footnote 23"><sup>23</sup></a><a name="f23"></a> </p>

<p>Second, trade
protection may lead to very large payouts to a small number of producers and
hence is often inequitable. Any time a product receives import protection, of
course, a relatively small number of domestic producers receive
benefits--through higher prices--at the cost of all domestic consumers in the
economy. On top of this, a disproportionately small number of sectors, and often
a disproportionately small number of firms within a sector, tend to enjoy the
gains from protection. For example, more than one-half of the antidumping and
countervailing duty orders in place as of August were on iron and steel-related
products alone; by contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of total private
nonfarm employment is accounted for by iron and steel producers.<a href="#fn24" title="footnote 24"><sup>24</sup></a><a name="f24"></a>
As another example, according to a 1993 General Accounting Office study, 42
percent of the benefits to growers from sugar protection went to just 1 percent
of growers.<a href="#fn25" title="footnote 25"><sup>25</sup></a><a name="f25"></a> Although
Americans favor policies designed to help the small farmer, much larger
enterprises are also benefiting from agricultural trade protection. </p>

<p>This disturbingly
inequitable distribution of the benefits of protectionism is exacerbated under
current law by provisions allowing antidumping and countervailing duties to be
disbursed to the companies that petitioned for the duties. These provisions,
which have been ruled illegal by the WTO, lead to protected producers being
rewarded twice: Once through the higher prices stemming from the trade
protection and again through the disbursal of the higher duties paid by
importers. The distribution of these payouts has been extremely skewed: For
fiscal year 2003, a single firm received more than one-fourth of the $190
million in countervailing and antidumping duties that were distributed to U.S.
firms.<a href="#fn26" title="footnote 26"><sup>26</sup></a><a name="f26"></a> </p>

<p>Import quotas (as
opposed to tariffs) raise a third concern about trade protection. By
restricting the supply of certain types of imports within the United States,
quotas may benefit those foreign producers who retain the right to sell to U.S.
markets by raising the prices of their goods. For example, one study found
that, of the $8.6 billion in net welfare costs induced by the Multi-Fiber
Agreement, which restricts textile and apparel imports, about $6 billion
accrued to those foreign producers who were allotted shares of the import
quotas.<a href="#fn27" title="footnote 27"><sup>27</sup></a><a name="f27"></a> Surely,
many Americans would cease to support certain types of import protections if
they knew that such actions were serving to prop up the profits of foreign
producers. </p>

<p>Finally, we must
not forget that trade actions, while sometimes protecting some American workers
in import-competing industries, often invite the threat of foreign retaliation
that would hurt American workers in export industries. For example, after the
imposition of steel safeguard duties in March 2002, eight of our trading
partners initiated safeguard investigations of their own on steel imports. Given
the importance of export markets to the most dynamic areas of U.S.
manufacturing, we cannot afford to jeopardize them by inviting foreign barriers
to our products.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>In conclusion, I
think it unlikely that we will see a marked global reversal of trade
liberalization on the order of the restrictions enacted in the 1930s.
Policymakers have generally learned the lessons of that destructive episode.
Nevertheless, it is not inconceivable that progress in dismantling trade
barriers could stall. Many of the easiest negotiations--such as on lowering
tariffs--have already taken place. More ambitious and intrusive trade
liberalizations, which often involve dismantling barriers to internal
competition or cherished systems of domestic subsidies, may not have the
necessary public support. It is also possible that a multiplicity of narrow,
targeted trade actions--such as antidumping or safeguard actions--could lead to
a de facto rollback in the overall degree of free trade even without a
concerted shift in national policies.</p>

<p>Thus, it is
crucial to maintain public pressure for free trade. First, it is important to
continue to educate the public and create a political environment supportive of
free trade. In this respect, targeted criticisms of protectionist actions may
be more effective than general paeans to free trade. In a recent speech, my
colleague, William Poole, urged journalists describing trade restrictions to
ask who gains, who loses, and what is the net gain or loss for the economy as a
whole?<a href="#fn28" title="footnote 28"><sup>28</sup></a><a name="f28"></a> I very much
support that sentiment. Second, it is crucial to implement policies that
foster stability and economic growth. Reducing unemployment and diminishing
economic insecurity will likely be more effective against protectionism than a
thousand speeches like this one. Toward that end, the Federal Reserve will do
its part by working to promote stable financial conditions and sustainable,
noninflationary growth.</p>
