	  <strong><em>Economic flexibility</em></strong><br>
      <b>Before the National Italian American Foundation, Washington, D.C.</b><br>
	  <b>October 12, 2005</b> 


<P>	It is a pleasure once again to speak before the National Italian American Foundation.  I have
long since been awarded the status of honorary Italian, for which I am sincerely appreciative.</P>

<P>	In my more than eighteen years at the Federal Reserve, much has surprised me, but nothing
more than the remarkable ability of our economy to absorb and recover from the shocks of stock
market crashes, credit crunches, terrorism, and hurricanes--blows that would have almost certainly
precipitated deep recessions in decades past.  This resilience, not evident except in retrospect, owes to
a remarkable increase in economic flexibility, partly the consequence of deliberate economic policy and
partly the consequence of innovations in information technology.</P>

<P>	A couple of weeks ago, I outlined to a convention of fellow economists how I believe this all
came about.  I should like to share some of those views with you this morning.</P>

<P>	For this country's first century and a half, government was only peripherally engaged in what
we currently term the management of aggregate demand.  Any endeavor to alter the path of private
economic activity through active intervention would have been deemed inappropriate and, more
important, unnecessary.  In one of the more notable coincidences of history, our Declaration of
Independence was signed the same year in which Adam Smith published his <EM>Wealth of Nations</EM>. 
Smith's prescription of letting markets prevail with minimal governmental interference became the
guiding philosophy of American leadership for much of our history.</P>

<P>	With a masterful insight into the workings of the free-market institutions that were then
emerging, Smith postulated an "invisible hand" in which competitive behavior drove an economy's
resources toward their fullest and most efficient use.  Economic growth and prosperity, he argued,
would emerge if governments stood aside and allowed markets to work.</P>

<P>	Indeed, within a very few decades, free-market capitalism became the prevailing stance of most
governments' economic policy, even if it was often implemented imperfectly.  This framework
withstood the conceptual onslaughts of Robert Owen's utopians, Karl Marx's communists and later,
the Fabian socialists.</P>

<P>	The free-market paradigm came under more-vigorous attack after the collapse of the world's
major economies in the 1930s.  As the global depression deepened, the seeming failure of competitive
markets to restore full employment perplexed economists until John Maynard Keynes offered an
explanation that was to influence policy practitioners for generations to come.  He argued that, contrary
to the tenets of Smith and his followers, market systems did not always converge to full employment. 
They often appeared to settle at an equilibrium in which significant segments of the workforce were
unable to find jobs.  In the place of Smith's laissez-faire approach arose the view that government
action was required to restore full employment and to rectify what were seen as other deficiencies of
market-driven outcomes.</P>

<P>	A tidal wave of regulation soon swept over much of the American business community.  Labor
relations, securities markets, banking, agricultural pricing, and many other segments of the
U.S. economy became subject to the oversight of government.</P>

<P>	The apparent success of the economy during World War II, which operated at full employment
in contrast to the earlier frightening developments during the Depression years, led to a considerable
reluctance to fully dismantle wartime regulations when the hostilities came to an end.</P>

<P>	However, cracks in the facade of government economic management appeared early in the
post-World War II years, and those cracks continued to widen as time passed.  At the macro level, the
system of wage and price controls imposed in the 1970s to deal with the problem of inflation proved
unworkable and ineffective.  And at the micro level, heavy regulation of many industries was
increasingly seen as impeding efficiency and competitiveness.  By the early 1980s, the long-prevalent
notion that the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union was catching up with the West had
begun to be discredited, though it was not fully discarded until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989
exposed the economic ruin behind the Iron Curtain.</P>

<P>	Starting in the 1970s, U.S. Presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities in the Congress,
responded to the growing recognition of the distortions created by regulation, by deregulating large
segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and financial services industries.  The stated
purpose of this deregulation was to enhance competition, which had come to be seen as a significant
spur to productivity growth and elevated standards of living.  Assisting in the dismantling of economic
restraints was the persistent, albeit slow, lowering of barriers to cross-border trade and finance.</P>

<P>	As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once-great economic power that
had lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned
Harvard professor, had called "creative destruction"--the continual scrapping of old technologies to
make way for the innovative.  In that paradigm, standards of living rise because depreciation and other
cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent technologies are marshaled, along
with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge
technologies.  Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital.</P>

<P>	Through this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step, as high levels of
productivity associated with innovative technologies displace less-efficient productive capacity.  The
model presupposes the continuous churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new
displaces the old.</P>

<P>	As the 1980s progressed, the success of that strategy confirmed the earlier views that a
loosening of regulatory restraint on business would improve the flexibility of our economy.  No specific
program encompassed and coordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, but there was a growing
recognition that a market economy could best withstand and recover from shocks when provided
maximum flexibility.</P>

<P>	Beyond deregulation, innovative technologies, especially information technologies, have
contributed critically to enhanced flexibility.  A quarter-century ago, for example, companies often
required weeks to discover the emergence of inventory imbalances, allowing production to continue to
exacerbate the excess.  Excessive stockbuilding, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline in output than
would have been necessary had the knowledge of the status of inventories been fully current.  The
advent of innovative information technologies significantly shortened the reporting lag, enabling flexible
real-time responses to emerging imbalances.</P>

<P>	Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and
elsewhere, to advance flexibility in the financial sector.  Financial stability may turn out to have been the
most important contributor to the evident significant gains in economic stability over the past two
decades.</P>

<P>	Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their
ability to leverage offers an efficient source of funding.  But in periods of severe financial stress, such
leverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crises
that led to recession or worse.  But recent regulatory reform, coupled with innovative technologies, has
stimulated the development of financial products, such as asset-backed securities, collateral loan
obligations, and credit default swaps, that facilitate the dispersion of risk.</P>

<P>	Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with
improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs
of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. 
The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in their
credit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less
leverage.  Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds
continue to be willing, at a price, to supply credit protection.</P>

<P>	These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far
more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than the one that existed just a
quarter-century ago.  After the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000, unlike previous periods
following large financial shocks, no major financial institution defaulted, and the economy held up far
better than many had anticipated.</P>

<P>	If we have attained a degree of flexibility that can mitigate most significant shocks--a
proposition as yet not fully tested--the performance of the economy will be improved and the job of
macroeconomic policymakers will be made much simpler.</P>

<P>	Governments today, although still far more activist than in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, are rediscovering the benefits of competition and the resilience to economic shocks that it
fosters.  We are also beginning to recognize an international version of Smith's invisible hand in the
globalization of economic forces.</P>

<P>	Whether by intention or by happenstance, many, if not most, governments in recent decades
have been relying more and more on the forces of the marketplace and reducing their intervention in
market outcomes.  We appear to be revisiting Adam Smith's notion that the more flexible an economy,
the greater its ability to self-correct after inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances.  That greater
tendency toward self-correction has made the cyclical stability of the economy less dependent on the
actions of macroeconomic policymakers, whose responses often have come too late or have been
misguided.</P>

<P>	It is important to remember that most adjustment of a market imbalance is well under way
before the imbalance becomes widely identified as a problem.  Individual prices, exchange rates, and
interest rates, adjust incrementally in real time to restore balance.  In contrast, administrative or policy
actions that await clear evidence of imbalance are of necessity late.</P>

<P>	Being able to rely on markets to do the heavy lifting of adjustment is an exceptionally valuable
policy asset.  The impressive performance of the U.S. economy over the past couple of decades,
despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers the
clearest evidence of the benefits of increased market flexibility.</P>

<P>	We weathered a decline on October 19, 1987, of a fifth of the market value of U.S. equities
with little evidence of subsequent macroeconomic stress--an episode that hinted at a change in
adjustment dynamics.  The credit crunch of the early 1990s and the bursting of the stock market bubble
in 2000 were absorbed with the shallowest recessions in the post-World War II period.  And the
economic fallout from the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was moderated by market forces, with
severe economic weakness evident for only a few weeks.  Most recently, the flexibility of our
market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and
futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years.  The
consequence has been a far more stable economy.</P>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<P>	Flexibility is most readily achieved by fostering an environment of maximum competition.  A key
element in creating this environment is flexible labor markets.  Many working people, regrettably,
equate labor market flexibility with job insecurity.</P>

<P>	Despite that perception, flexible labor policies appear to <EM>promote</EM> job creation, not destroy it. 
An increased capacity of management to discharge workers without excessive cost, for example,
apparently increases companies' willingness to hire without fear of unremediable mistakes.  The net
effect, to the surprise of most, has been what appears to be a <EM>decline</EM> in the structural unemployment
rate in the United States.</P>

<P>	Protectionism in all its guises, both domestic and international, does not contribute to the
welfare of American workers.  At best, it is a short-term fix at a cost of lower standards of living for the
nation as a whole.  We need increased education and training for those displaced by creative
destruction, not a stifling of competition.</P>

<P>	A consequence of our highly competitive, rapidly growing economy is that the average
American will hold many different jobs in a lifetime.  Accordingly, education is no longer the sole
province of the young.  Significant numbers of workers continue their education well beyond their
twenties.  Millions enroll in community colleges in later life, for example, to upgrade their skills or get
new ones.  It is a measure of the dynamism of the U.S. economy that community colleges are one of the
fastest growing segments of our educational system.</P>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<P>	Moving forward, I trust that we have learned durable lessons about the benefits of fostering and
preserving a flexible economy.  That flexibility has been the product of the economic dynamism of our
workers and firms that was unleashed, in part, by the efforts of policymakers to remove rigidities and
promote competition.</P>

<P>	Although the business cycle has not disappeared, flexibility has made the economy more
resilient to shocks and more stable overall during the past couple of decades.  To be sure, that stability,
by fostering speculative excesses, has created some new challenges for policymakers.  But more
fundamentally, an environment of greater economic stability has been key to the impressive growth in
the standards of living and economic welfare so evident in the United States.</P>
