    <TD> It's a pleasure to participate in your annual summit on economic development. 
      Given the nature of the conference, I would like to focus on a matter of 
      mutual interest--improvements in asset accumulation in traditionally underserved 
      markets of our household and business sectors and the importance of access 
      to the financing and information tools that promote and sustain this progress.<br>
      <br>
      In our economy, the three principal means for household asset accumulation 
      are through home ownership, small business ownership, and savings. As important 
      as these are for the individual, they also represent distinct and important 
      benefits to the broader economy and, therefore, play prominent roles in 
      the operation of our financial markets and the priorities of our public 
      policy. <br>
      <br>
      The choice to buy a home is a decision to plant a family's roots in a community 
      with all the implicit incentives to make that community thrive. Where home 
      ownership flourishes, it is no surprise to find increased neighborhood stability, 
      more civic-minded residents, better school systems, and reduced crime rates.<br>
      <br>
      Just as important is the effect of home ownership on a household's ability 
      to accumulate assets. For most households, home ownership represents a significant 
      financial milestone and is an important vehicle for ongoing savings. The 
      Federal Reserve's 1998 triennial Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that 
      home ownership represented 44 percent of gross assets for families earning 
      $50,000 or less annually. Further, investment in residential property has 
      been generally more stable than other types of investment, and it is perceived 
      to be largely permanent.<br>
      <br>
      With these important benefits, an increased rate of home ownership has been 
      chosen by our society as a national priority, with many public- and private-sector 
      resources devoted to achieving this goal. Indeed, measurable progress has 
      been made toward this end, with the overall rate of home ownership reaching 
      68 percent, a new high, in the third quarter of last year. In assessing 
      the opportunity for home ownership in underserved markets, the Census Bureau 
      reports significant gains. The homeownership rate for blacks and Hispanics, 
      between 1997 and 2001, grew at more than double the pace for the general 
      population. Additionally, the homeownership rate among households earning 
      less than the median income increased more than three times the pace for 
      households with incomes above the median. <br>
      <br>
      Small business accounts for about half of private gross domestic product 
      in our economy. It is an important vehicle for significant numbers of minority 
      families to accumulate assets.<br>
      <br>
      Recently released data from the Census Bureau, for example, indicate that, 
      between 1992 and 1997, the number of minority-owned businesses grew more 
      than four times as fast as the number of U.S. firms overall, increasing 
      from 2.1 million to about 2.8 million. In addition, the Census Bureau estimates 
      that during this five-year period the number of women-owned businesses increased 
      16 percent, to 5.4 million enterprises.<br>
      <br>
      These data suggest that the increases in small business ownership and equity 
      investment by traditionally underserved populations result, in part, from 
      increased access to appropriate financing to fund the start-up and growth 
      of businesses. It is essential that the opportunity to start an enterprise 
      is open to anyone with a viable business concept. We must continue to seek 
      ways to promote the creation and expansion of viable firms by lowering barriers 
      to funding and financial services.<br>
      <br>
      To the extent that market participants discriminate--consciously or, more 
      insidiously, unconsciously--capital does not flow to its most profitable 
      uses, and the distribution of output is distorted. In the end, costs are 
      higher, less real output is produced, and national wealth accumulation is 
      slowed. By removing the non-economic distortions that arise as a result 
      of discrimination, we can generate higher returns to human capital and other 
      productive resources. Investors and lenders need to understand that failure 
      to recognize the profitable opportunities represented by minority enterprises 
      not only harms these firms, it harms the lending institutions as well. Accordingly, 
      we must make further progress in establishing business relationships between 
      the financial services sector and the rapidly growing number of minority- 
      and women-owned businesses. <br>
      <br>
      Doing so is crucial since pursuing the obviously worthwhile goal of increasing 
      home ownership in minority communities also increases the debt of homeowners 
      in these communities. Debt cannot indefinitely be pyramided against home 
      equity as the principal or sole asset. Developing non-home equity, largely 
      through small-business ownership, not only enhances home ownership among 
      business owners in minority communities, it more importantly offers a source 
      of risk capital to budding entrepreneurs in that community.<br>
      <br>
      Household saving, of course, is a fundamental component for increasing financial 
      capacity and serves as a starting point for the accumulation of future tangible 
      assets, such as homes and businesses. It is also a source of funding for 
      education, which can materially improve future earning capacity. In the 
      1998 Survey of Consumer Finances, the top three reasons for saving given 
      by respondents were retirement, liquidity, and education. These survey data, 
      once again, exhibit positive trends among lower-income and minority populations.<br>
      <br>
      Some progress is being made regarding the ownership of financial assets 
      by families in the bottom quintile of net worth and by those who are nonwhite 
      or Hispanic. In addition, survey respondents in these two categories experienced 
      the largest increases in the ownership of transaction accounts, an important 
      indicator of financial progress because the accounts often serve as the 
      point of entry into the financial services industry. Despite these gains, 
      however, lower-income and minority families continue to represent a large 
      fraction of families that do not possess a checking account or, for that 
      matter, other assets. <br>
      <br>
      Sparse holdings of financial assets may, in part, be due to lack of access 
      to savings vehicles such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement 
      plans. Recognizing this possible link, community organizations have collaborated 
      with their partners in government and the private sector to design innovative 
      mechanisms for saving. One such vehicle is the individual development account, 
      which state and federal government agencies have embraced as a means for 
      facilitating saving for low-income households. Through tax benefits and 
      matching funds, this instrument helps individuals earmark funds to achieve 
      longer-term financial goals, such as purchasing a home, starting a business, 
      or pursuing higher education or job training. Besides providing a structured 
      account that offers a high incentive to save, individual development account 
      programs require participation in financial training to help individuals 
      continue on the path of economic betterment. <br>
      <br>
      Structural changes in the financial services industry, in recent years, 
      have heightened competition, encouraging market efficiencies that continue 
      to help drive down costs and to foster the emergence of increasingly diverse 
      and highly specialized organizations. These organizations--which range from 
      firms that offer their services through electronic delivery mechanisms to 
      local partnerships that provide one-on-one counseling and financing arrangements--provide 
      consumers with increased access to various credit and savings instruments.<br>
      <br>
      Community-based organizations have contributed in this evolving marketplace 
      by helping to ensure that traditionally underserved populations and geographic 
      areas are able to achieve gains in asset accumulation. And, as in the broader 
      economy, market-driven innovation has advanced community development, enabling 
      community-based organizations to more effectively respond to the needs of 
      the communities and families they serve. Community development organizations 
      working in partnership with financial corporations and governments have 
      created new intermediaries--community development corporations, micro-business 
      loan funds, and multibank and investor loan pools, among them--to provide 
      financial opportunity for lower-income individuals and families. These innovators 
      have succeeded in developing new approaches for engaging disadvantaged participants 
      in the economy in the same manner that any successful organization does--by 
      assessing need, evaluating risks, managing costs, and developing appropriate 
      products.<br>
      <br>
      Educational and training programs may be the most critical service offered 
      by community-based organizations to enhance the ability of lower-income 
      households to accumulate assets. Indeed, analysts have shown that a comprehensive 
      understanding of basic principles of budgeting and saving, at the start, 
      increases household wealth in later years.<br>
      <br>
      Education can also increase economic opportunity by enabling individuals 
      to overcome their reluctance or inability to take full advantage of technological 
      advances and product innovation. As market forces continue to expand the 
      range of financial services, consumers will have more choice and flexibility 
      in how they manage their finances, and they will seek instruction in the 
      use of the new technologies to help formulate better decisions. Financial 
      education can equip consumers with the fundamental knowledge required to 
      choose among the myriad of products and providers in the financial services 
      industry. It can also help to inculcate individuals with the financial knowledge 
      necessary to create household budgets, initiate savings plans, and make 
      strategic investment decisions. Such financial planning can help families 
      meet near-term obligations and maximize their longer-term well being and 
      is especially valuable for populations that have traditionally been underserved 
      by our financial system.<br>
      <br>
      Community-based organizations have an integral role in disseminating information 
      that can assist lower-income families in exploiting financial opportunity. 
      Because of their local focus, these organizations can develop educational 
      and training programs tailored to the markets they serve. Through homeownership 
      counseling programs, they offer families information that is fundamental 
      to obtaining and maintaining mortgage credit. (A recent study conducted 
      by one of the leading purchasers of home mortgages found that homeownership 
      counseling can effectively reduce delinquency rates by as much as a third.) 
      Community organizations are also using financial literacy campaigns to help 
      prevent vulnerable consumers from becoming entangled in financially devastating 
      credit arrangements. The campaigns are important in addressing abusive lending 
      practices that target specific neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the 
      population and can result in unaffordable payments, equity stripping, and 
      foreclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, training programs for microenterprise development provide information 
      on the fundamentals of starting a business, such as developing a business 
      plan and financial statements, that allow lenders and investors to evaluate 
      risk.<br>
      <br>
      Community groups are not alone in the effort to provide life-long financial 
      education. Some school systems have introduced financial management curricula, 
      and some employers have taken up the challenge. At the Federal Reserve Board, 
      for example, our Consumer and Community Affairs staff recently hosted several 
      well-attended educational programs for Federal Reserve employees, providing 
      information on qualifying for a mortgage and managing debt. The Community 
      Affairs and Public Information offices at the twelve Federal Reserve Banks 
      also have joined together, with the strong support of Governor Gramlich, 
      to promote both local and national financial literacy and economic education 
      programs. <br>
      <br>
      The Community Affairs Offices help financial institutions, community organizations, 
      and local governments increase economic opportunity in distressed neighborhoods 
      through strategic partnerships. The offices provide information on innovative 
      funding strategies for community economic development. And they seek new 
      ways of measuring the effectiveness of financial literacy programs. In our 
      call for papers for the Community Affairs Research Conference scheduled 
      for the spring of 2003, we have asked for studies that evaluate the effect 
      of such education initiatives. Measurement of the quality and long-term 
      success of these efforts will be particularly useful to the Federal Reserve 
      System as we develop and distribute financial and economic literacy products. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, I encourage community groups such as those represented here 
      to continue productive partnerships and activities that have yielded much 
      progress in increasing the assets of their constituencies. With your continued 
      commitment and market-driven product innovation, the prospect for increased 
      economic opportunity for traditionally underserved markets remains promising.<br>
