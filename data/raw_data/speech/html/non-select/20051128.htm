        <b> (on November 8) <br>
        To the Fourth Joint Central Bank Research Conference on Risk Management 
        and Systemic Risk, Frankfurt, Germany <br>
        (via videoconference) </b>
      <p><b> Financial Regulation: Seeking the Middle Way</b> </p>
      <p> I am pleased to participate in the panel discussion at this Fourth Joint 
        Central Bank Research Conference. As I will make clear, I think conferences 
        of this sort, by contributing to our understanding of financial innovations, 
        can play a critical role in policymakers' decisions. Financial innovations 
        have been coming at a rapid pace in recent years; new financial products 
        have been introduced and are expanding rapidly, and new institutions have 
        taken on prominent roles in key financial markets. Financial technologies 
        have improved as well and have the potential to contribute to the efficiency 
        and resilience of financial markets. However, with new products and institutions 
        comes the potential for new risks to financial stability. As a result, 
        we policymakers are likely to be torn. On the one hand, we may want to 
        encourage welfare-improving innovations by limiting the extent of regulation. 
        On the other hand, because of possible systemic concerns, some policymakers 
        may want to regulate innovative instruments and institutions even as they 
        are developing. In my view, policymakers can best balance these goals 
        by expending the effort needed to understand financial innovations as 
        they emerge and by avoiding overregulation that may stifle valuable innovations. 
      <p> When I talk about financial innovations, I have in mind several types 
        of developments. A far-reaching set of innovations--and the focus of this 
        panel--is the development and increasing popularity of products for the 
        transfer of credit risk. Prominent among such innovations are credit derivatives, 
        asset-backed securities, and secondary-market trading of syndicated loans. 
        Another important development has been the rapid growth of the hedge fund 
        industry, about which we learned a lot this morning, and its expanded 
        role in the financial system. On the retail side, we have seen a proliferation 
        of new lending products in the United States, including home-equity lines 
        of credit, interest-only and even negative-amortization mortgages, and 
        subprime mortgages and consumer loans. 
      <p> Today, I will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks associated 
        with new products and institutions and a middle way that regulators might 
        pursue as these new products and institutions emerge.
      <p> <strong>Benefits and Drawbacks</strong><br>
        Financial innovations hold the promise of improved efficiency and increased 
        overall economic welfare. For example, new products and markets can open 
        the door to new investment opportunities for a variety of market participants. 
        And improved risk-measurement and risk-management technologies can contribute 
        to an improved allocation of risk as risk is shifted to those more willing 
        and able to bear it. 
      <p> Financial innovations also have the potential to boost financial stability. 
        Risk-transfer mechanisms can not only better allocate risk but also reduce 
        its concentration. Improved efficiencies and increased competition may 
        result in substantially lower trading costs and may consequently improve 
        liquidity in many markets. Better liquidity, which is instrumental to 
        faster and more accurate price discovery and therefore to more-informative 
        prices, can also be brought about by an increased presence of new institutions 
        in new or existing markets. The entry of those new institutions into new 
        markets can, so long as the institutions prove resilient, increase the 
        availability of funds to borrowers in times of stress and may thus reduce 
        the likelihood of credit crunches. 
      <p> Although financial innovations have the capacity to improve economic 
        welfare overall, it is natural for policymakers to worry that innovations 
        may have unexpected and undesirable side effects and may even represent 
        new sources of systemic risk. For example, policymakers may be concerned 
        about unexpected price dynamics or problems in infrastructure or operations. 
        Market participants estimate how prices and investment flows are likely 
        to behave for new instruments, but their understanding becomes more detailed 
        and more accurate only as behavior under a variety of economic conditions 
        is observed, and the development of that understanding obviously takes 
        time. Under turbulent conditions, or when new information causes market 
        participants to question their own investment strategies, their behavior 
        may change rapidly, leading to rapid price changes that may seem outsized 
        relative to changes in economic fundamentals. That was briefly the case 
        recently in the market for synthetic collateralized debt obligations. 
        Market participants did not anticipate the sharp decline in implied default 
        correlations that followed the downgrades of Ford and General Motors debt. 
        Prices moved quite a bit for a short time as portfolios were rebalanced, 
        but spillovers to other markets were limited, and market volatility subsequently 
        eased. 
      <p> Problems with the infrastructure or operations that support an innovation--including 
        the underlying legal documentation and accounting--are also likely to 
        be revealed only over time, as exemplified by the technical difficulties 
        with restructuring clauses in credit default swaps that became apparent 
        a few years ago. In that case, default events and related payoffs sometimes 
        did not occur as expected, and so actual exposures differed from those 
        investors had intended. The result was a change in the value of existing 
        contracts and a period of market adjustment as new restructuring clauses 
        were developed and implemented. 
      <p> Of course, we should not want to prevent rapid price changes or changes 
        in investment flows, as such changes may be appropriate as new information 
        about fundamentals emerges. And the occurrence of glitches in new markets 
        and institutions need not reflect policy failures or provide evidence 
        that an innovation is undesirable. Preventing all such occurrences would 
        probably require us to stop all innovation. But neither is it desirable 
        that growing pains in one market or at a few institutions spill over so 
        strongly that the financial system as a whole could be destabilized. 
      <p> <strong>A Middle Way in Regulation</strong><br>
        Policymakers have a range of strategies available for dealing with innovation. 
        At one extreme, in theory we could take a completely hands-off approach, 
        allowing new financial markets and instruments to develop without restrictions 
        and indeed without any scrutiny, trusting private market participants 
        to do everything necessary for stability and efficiency. At the other 
        extreme, policymakers theoretically might be quite heavy-handed, either 
        imposing regulations on virtually every market and instrument to stop 
        any innovations that, in their judgment, could cause harm or, conversely, 
        actively fostering or subsidizing innovations seen as desirable.
      <p> Obviously, these are extreme positions, and I do not know of any practicing 
        policymaker who seriously wants to pursue either extreme course. Today 
        I wish to argue for a middle ground in which markets are allowed to work 
        and develop and in which policymakers work hard to understand new developments 
        and to help market participants see the need for improvements where appropriate. 
        In my view, regulations should be imposed only when market participants 
        do not have the incentive or the capability to effectively manage the 
        risks created by financial innovation. For example, explicit or implicit 
        subsidies of some institutions could limit market discipline of their 
        risk-taking, leading to a concentration of risk so large that even the 
        most sophisticated institutions would find it next to impossible to manage 
        the risk under stressful circumstances. Or policymakers may be concerned 
        that some potential parties to innovative contracts, especially in the 
        retail arena, are insufficiently knowledgeable to understand or manage 
        the associated risks. I believe such instances are rare. Making a case 
        for early regulatory intervention is particularly difficult when the private 
        parties involved in an innovation are sophisticated because, in many cases, 
        they will be the first to recognize possible problems and will have strong 
        incentives to fix them and also to protect themselves against fraud or 
        unfair dealing. 
      <p> So how should policymakers proceed down this middle path? First of all, 
        we need to learn--we need to understand and evaluate the innovations that 
        are taking place in financial markets. This process should include information 
        sharing with other authorities, including those in other nations, in order 
        to benefit from the experiences in other markets and regions. The resulting 
        improved understanding is often enough to prepare policymakers to deal 
        with any breakdowns that do occur and to avoid having the breakdowns turn 
        into systemic problems. The U.S. response to the century date change is 
        an example from a different context that fits into this category. In that 
        case, policymakers worked hard to understand the complex practical issues 
        and to share that knowledge with financial firms. Those firms independently 
        evaluated the risks they faced and took appropriate action to manage them 
        effectively. 
      <p> Improved understanding may also ease concerns about potential risks. 
        For example, in light of the effects of financial consolidation on the 
        number of firms acting as dealers in the market for dollar interest rate 
        options, the Federal Reserve became concerned about possible risks to 
        the functioning of that market. These concerns included questions about 
        the adequacy of risk management at the remaining dealers and about the 
        possible effects that problems at one of those dealers could have on its 
        counterparties and market liquidity. However, further investigation by 
        Federal Reserve staff suggested that market participants were generally 
        managing their market and counterparty risks effectively and that those 
        hedging risk in the options market would not unduly suffer from a temporary 
        disruption in liquidity. Our wariness about concentration in this market 
        has not disappeared as a result of our improved understanding, but it 
        has diminished. In general, improved knowledge about financial innovations 
        may prevent the imposition of unwarranted restrictions and is surely a 
        precursor to intelligent regulation in the event it is warranted. 
      <p> A second step for policymakers walking the middle path should be to 
        ensure that market participants have the proper incentives and the information 
        they need to protect themselves from any problems related to new products, 
        markets, or institutions; by so doing, policymakers can perhaps mitigate 
        those problems. Policymakers should insist that regulated firms effectively 
        manage the risks associated with new activities and markets, thereby fostering 
        effective market discipline of risk-taking, including risk-taking by unregulated 
        firms. Such an insistence generally does not require new regulation but 
        rather is an application of existing regulation in a potentially new context. 
        One of the lessons of the difficulties at Long-Term Capital Management 
        (LTCM) was that the hedge fund had been able to achieve very high levels 
        of leverage because some regulated counterparties had not appropriately 
        managed their counterparty risk exposures. Subsequently, both banks and 
        supervisors had to reassess what such management entailed. Clearly, supervisors 
        should strongly encourage institutions to know their risk posture and 
        to be able to control it and react appropriately as circumstances change. 
        Policymakers should insist on similarly high risk-management standards 
        for regulated financial institutions that provide retail products. As 
        a case in point, bank supervisors in the United States recently issued 
        guidance about the management of risks related to home-equity lines of 
        credit. This guidance did not involve new regulation of these instruments 
        but rather reminded institutions offering such products that they have 
        an obligation to manage the resulting risks appropriately.
      <p> A pervasive lack of awareness about the risks embedded in new financial 
        products certainly increases the likelihood that users of those products 
        may face difficulties and that those difficulties may become systemic. 
        One way policymakers can help prevent this possibility from happening 
        is by supporting increased transparency and disclosure. Although counterparties 
        in wholesale markets should generally be expected to demand and obtain 
        the information they need to evaluate their risks, policymakers can no 
        doubt help establish high standards. In the case of retail transactions, 
        support for efforts to foster the basic financial literacy of households 
        is a useful complement to efforts to promote appropriate disclosure. The 
        more consumers are equipped to interpret disclosures, the more effective 
        those disclosures are likely to be.
      <p> A third feature of the moderate approach I am trying to chart is an 
        active dialogue between policymakers and market participants. In my view, 
        policymakers should serve as a voice for the development of infrastructure 
        and sensible standards and practices. Ideally such steps would be taken 
        by market participants of their own volition, but sometimes informal interventions 
        by policymakers can help foster cooperative efforts by market participants. 
        For example, partly in reaction to the report of the second Counterparty 
        Risk Management Policy Group, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently 
        hosted a meeting with representatives of major participants in the credit 
        default swap market, as well as with their domestic and international 
        supervisors, to discuss a range of issues, including market practices 
        with regard to assignments of trades and operational issues associated 
        with confirmation backlogs. The result was an industry commitment to take 
        concrete steps to address issues of concern. 
      <p> A fourth dimension of my proposed middle path is the ongoing monitoring 
        of key markets and institutions. Policymakers should be aware of any emerging 
        stresses in the financial system, including those related to new instruments 
        and institutions. Indeed, some central banks have created "financial 
        stability" staff groups to oversee such monitoring and, in some 
        cases, to publish regular financial stability reports. In the event that 
        such monitoring suggests that the operations of some institutions or markets 
        are under significant strain and, importantly, that the resulting pressures 
        on businesses and households could have a material adverse effect on the 
        real economy, the central bank may want to respond by adjusting the stance 
        of monetary policy. 
      <p> Finally, financial innovations may on occasion warrant new regulations 
        because financial institutions either cannot or will not manage the associated 
        risks appropriately. Indeed, regulation should be seen as part of the 
        broader "infrastructure" that supports both financial stability 
        and innovation, and like other more traditional infrastructure, regulatory 
        regimes have to keep up. For example, developments in financial markets 
        and advances in the ability of banks to measure and manage their risks 
        have increasingly made the existing capital regulation of the largest 
        banks, the 1988 Basel Accord, look antiquated. Basel II is a more flexible 
        framework than Basel I and is intended to better permit capital regulation 
        to keep up with financial market innovations in the future.
      <p> To conclude, I wish to emphasize that policymakers should have a bias 
        toward trusting financial markets to manage the introduction of new products 
        and the development of new institutions smoothly and without undue stress 
        to the financial system. However, we cannot take such an outcome for granted: 
        Financial firms may not consider the effects of their decisions on the 
        stability of other firms or on the broader financial markets, and some 
        may lack the incentives and ability to learn about and manage the risks 
        induced by financial innovations. In such cases, policymakers may need 
        to work with markets and their participants, and on occasion regulate 
        them, to achieve the desired outcomes. However, policymakers should, wherever 
        possible, avoid premature regulation that could stifle innovation. I would 
        note that a significant number of substantial shocks to financial markets 
        have occurred in recent years--including, for example, the difficulties 
        at Long-Term Capital Management and the unexpected and massive fraud at 
        some high-profile companies--and yet the broader effects on the real economy 
        have ultimately been quite small. Our financial markets are flexible and 
        resilient, and they can absorb shocks surprisingly well. As a result, 
        most risks caused by new developments in financial markets should be manageable 
        without heavy-handed regulation. This meeting is a good example of what 
        my middle course suggests we should be doing: working hard to understand 
        innovations and their possible implications. Alertness and knowledge on 
        the part of policymakers would go a long way toward ensuring that our 
        positive recent track record will carry on amid what I am sure will continue 
        to be a rapidly changing financial landscape.<br><br>
