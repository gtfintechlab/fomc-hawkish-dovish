    <TD> 
      <p>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the U.S. economy 
        entered its tenth postwar recession early this year. At this point, and 
        according to the Blue Chip forecasters, the recession seems to have been 
        much milder than most, with the unemployment rate unlikely to go much 
        above 6 percent. But in the early fall there were moments when the risk 
        of a serious downturn was much greater, and even the relatively flat 2001 
        recession prompted renewed policy discussions about how to deal with recessions. 
        Today, I offer my own views on the subject. For obvious reasons, I will 
        avoid an evaluation of specific actions or pieces of legislation and just 
        discuss a general strategy.</p>
      <p>My central point is that putting in place a sensible long-term macroeconomic 
        policy strategy, covering both fiscal and monetary policy, is extremely 
        important. The main importance of such a strategy involves the effects 
        of the policy position on trend economic growth, not recessions or expansions. 
        Business-cycle movements obviously have to be dealt with, but for the 
        most part they can be addressed through the existing system of fiscal 
        and monetary shock absorbers. At times, these shock absorbers may have 
        to be augmented with discretionary antirecessionary fiscal actions, but 
        these times are relatively rare. And the discretionary antirecessionary 
        fiscal actions should meet stringent criteria to make sure that they do 
        more good than harm. </p>
      <p><b>Sound Long-Run Policies</b><br>
        The fundamental reason for establishing a sound long-run macroeconomic 
        policy strategy is that the path of trend productivity growth is a nation's 
        most crucial economic variable. It determines the long-run growth of living 
        standards and is a main determinant of the affordability of entitlement 
        spending programs, the level of household wealth, the value of the currency, 
        and other economic magnitudes. Whatever policy does in response to short-term 
        needs, that policy should be formulated in the context of a sound overall 
        long-run strategy.</p>
      <p>The path of trend productivity growth has many underlying determinants--the 
        vibrancy of technology, the strength of entrepreneurial motives, the flexibility 
        of labor and capital markets, and the effectiveness of regulatory policies, 
        to name a few. But there are also two vital macroeconomic policy determinants. 
        One, involving monetary policy, is a credible commitment to stable prices 
        in the long run. The second, involving fiscal policy, concerns the share 
        of total output devoted to national saving. Output that is not devoted 
        to saving will be consumed, and that's that. Output that is saved, or 
        reserved from consumption, will be devoted to capital investment, which 
        equips workers with new capital, enhances productivity, and raises living 
        standards.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the United States has been the fortunate beneficiary 
        of a productivity growth spurt. Both monetary and fiscal policy have played 
        an important role. The commitment to and realization of stable prices 
        have surely been critical background forces, facilitating long-term 
        planning and a more efficient allocation of resources. On the fiscal side, 
        the role of saving and investment has been important as well. Production-function 
        decompositions of this growth spurt suggest that a good 30 to 40 percent 
        of it has been due to so-called capital-deepening productivity change, 
        reflecting increases in the economy's capital-labor ratio. </p>
      <p>Fiscal policy is relevant because it helps determine the national saving 
        that finances this capital investment. National saving can be generated 
        privately, by households and business, or by government. Efforts to promote 
        private saving certainly have merit in theory, but the bald empirical 
        fact for the United States is that the government has introduced a number 
        of tax provisions to increase private saving over the past twenty years, 
        and almost all of them have been correlated with a reduction in the overall 
        rate of private saving. These measures could have been effective at the 
        margin, but they have not had a large enough effect to counter the general 
        downward trend in private saving. As an added caution, from a standpoint 
        of national saving, it makes no sense to introduce costly private saving 
        incentives that then reduce government saving more than they raise private 
        saving.</p>
      <p>What has seemed to raise national saving is government fiscal policy, 
        the budget surpluses. Government saving, or a surplus, leads to a reduction 
        in outstanding government debt to which wealth-holders, for the most part, 
        seem to respond by devoting the funds to private credit markets. This 
        response, in turn, finances capital investment. Much of this capital investment 
        is likely to be in the United States, directly influencing output and 
        productivity. But even if the saving flows abroad, either through the 
        buying back of foreign-owned capital or the purchase of new capital in 
        foreign countries, the United States gets the returns on this investment, 
        which raise income growth and future consumption.</p>
      <p>The only instance in which government surpluses do not raise national 
        saving is the so-called Ricardian equivalence scenario. In this scenario, 
        households learn that the government plans to run a surplus, and they 
        reduce their own saving by their proportionate share of this surplus. 
        In general, economists find that if Ricardian offsets exist at all, they 
        are a modest share of the relevant government surpluses. At a more casual 
        level, I have, for many years surveyed my non-economist friends to see 
        how they alter their own consumption behavior in response to national 
        fiscal policy. The usual response is a blank stare: If these non-economists 
        have even imagined there to be a connection between government deficits 
        and their own saving, they have no idea how much to respond and in what 
        direction.</p>
      <p><b>Fiscal Policy</b><br>
        What, then, is the long-run fiscal policy that leads to a vibrant economy 
        with a high rate of productivity growth? In general, it implies nudging 
        the economy in the direction of raising the overall rate of national saving. 
        It is theoretically possible for an economy to save so much that the long-term 
        path of consumption per capita is actually lowered, but generally economists 
        believe that the U.S. economy is well short of that saturation point. 
        For the present circumstances, I am proceeding on the assumption that 
        more saving is better.</p>
      <p>I start by decomposing the federal budget into two components, the cash 
        surplus of the trust funds for social security and some other entitlement 
        programs, and the net surplus for all other activities of government, 
        which I will call the general budget surplus. For the general budget surplus, 
        let me repeat a very simple rule, similar to that enunciated by both the 
        Committee for Economic Development and Milton Friedman fifty years ago. 
        The rule is that the general budget surplus should average zero over the 
        long run. This general budget should not be exactly balanced each year, 
        but there should be long-run balance. In the event of a recession, for 
        example, it is natural, and actually healthy, for revenues to fall, spending 
        to rise, and the general budget to move into deficit. This deficit helps 
        prop up the economy in the recession, which is why these budgetary movements 
        are called automatic fiscal stabilizers. But though deficits are excusable 
        in a recession, they are not desirable in general. If the following period 
        sees an expansion, the general budget should move into surplus, and over 
        time the general budget surplus should average zero. Indeed, the long-term 
        value of higher national saving gives an argument for aiming at a positive 
        general budget surplus on average, but I will not push that argument here 
        because it is most likely a political nonstarter.</p>
      <p>For the surpluses of the entitlement program trust funds, covering social 
        security, Medicare, and the retirement benefits of government employees, 
        one would follow a different rule. These trust funds are set up to finance 
        long-term entitlement expenditures. To illustrate, for social security, 
        the largest of these entitlement programs, revenue from worker payroll 
        taxes go into a trust fund and, along with any earnings on asset holdings, 
        are used to pay retiree benefits. These trust funds should then be evaluated 
        on an actuarial basis--whether present and future anticipated inflows 
        are adequate to pay anticipated present and future program benefits. If 
        not, corrective steps should be taken. Again using social security as 
        an example, inflows currently exceed outflows (a cash surplus), but forecast 
        inflows do not cover forecast outflows (an actuarial deficit). Even though 
        the fund has a cash surplus today, some combination of tax increases or 
        long-term cuts in benefits is needed to maintain these surpluses into 
        the future and to restore actuarial soundness. This situation is not atypical 
        for countries like the United States with an aging population.</p>
      <p>For a country with an aging population, the combination of a general 
        budget surplus that is zero on average and trust funds in cash surplus 
        will normally lead to surpluses in the overall, or unified, budget. These 
        surpluses can be rationalized as a technique to build up the nation's 
        future capital stock. Since the population is aging, a relatively small 
        cohort of workers will soon have to pay benefits for a relatively large 
        cohort of retirees, and the idea is at least to give this small cohort 
        of workers a larger capital stock to work with. Having this type of a 
        budget policy accomplishes three objectives simultaneously:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The surpluses provide for capital accumulation.</li>
        <li>They do that to a greater extent the more the country's population 
          is aging.</li>
        <li>Automatic fiscal stabilizers remain to deal with recessions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The discussion to this point has been entirely in terms of the federal 
        budget. In principle, state governments could follow the same countercyclical 
        fiscal policy, except for one problem. States typically operate under 
        legislative or constitutional limits on their deficits. The only way states 
        could run deficits in recessions is if they had saved a store of assets 
        in earlier booms. This presaving strategy sounds nice in principle and 
        is a good idea, but very few states actually follow it to a sufficient 
        degree. So, as state budget situations worsen because of the state automatic 
        fiscal stabilizers, the unfortunate but likely result is that states will 
        lack the rainy day resources to run deficits and will need to make budget 
        changes that neutralize their own automatic stabilizers. </p>
      <p><b>Monetary Policy</b><br>
        The automatic fiscal stabilizers help in stabilizing the economy over 
        the business cycle, but the main burden of fighting recessions is left 
        to the central bank. Traditionally there have been two reasons for this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monetary policy responds to shocks much more quickly than fiscal <br>
          policy.</li>
        <li>It is generally believed that, if an economy is open to foreign trade 
          and capital<br>
          flows and has flexible exchange rates, monetary policy becomes more<br>
          effective in fighting cycles whereas fiscal policy becomes less effective.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be sure, one can raise questions about the second reason--the argument 
        hinges on the fact that the value of the domestic currency is positively 
        correlated with interest rates, which in recent years has often not seemed 
        to be the case for the United States. But despite any qualms about the 
        second reason, the first reason seems solid for just about any known real 
        world economy.</p>
      <p>For a long time now, central banks have been trying to stabilize economies, 
        in an art form known as &quot;leaning against the wind.&quot; John Taylor 
        has developed an equation that provides one statistical description of 
        how this practice might be followed. Under what is known as the Taylor 
        rule, there is a certain equilibrium position for some short-term interest 
        rate. The central bank uses open market operations to raise the short-term 
        rate above this equilibrium in response to threats of inflation and to 
        lower the rate below equilibrium in response to threats of unemployment. 
        I won't go into details, but if the central bank is willing to announce 
        an inflation target, the policy responses implicit in a Taylor rule could 
        be similar to those implicit in forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting, 
        a policy strategy now used successfully in controlling inflation by about 
        ten leading economies around the world (twenty, if one counts the European 
        Central Bank, which practices a form of inflation targeting).</p>
      <p>Determining how much central banks should raise short-term interest rates 
        in response to inflation, or lower them in response to recession, or even 
        in response to subpar growth, becomes an empirical matter. However much 
        they do, we have another stabilizer for the economy. As demand growth 
        heats up, the central bank will raise short-term rates to try to limit 
        the boom and the resulting inflation. As recessions threaten, the central 
        bank will lower short-term rates to try to limit the downturn.</p>
      <p><b>Discretionary Fiscal Policy?</b><br>
        With this long-run strategy in place, and with at least two shock absorbers--one 
        monetary, one fiscal--we are now ready for the sixty-four dollar question. 
        In the average recession, should there be additional discretionary fiscal 
        actions? For such actions to be effective, they must satisfy three conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They should stimulate spending.</li>
        <li>They should be instituted quickly.</li>
        <li>They should be reversed quickly or automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The reason speed and reversibility are important is that most recessions 
        are not very long, averaging about twelve months in the United States. 
        If some expansionary action comes into effect late in a recession, say 
        in the twelfth month, it is likely to add to the vigor of the next expansion 
        and hence increase business-cycle volatility. Reversibility is also important 
        because of the overall budget rule discussed earlier. If the general budget 
        were already in approximate balance, any continuing expansionary fiscal 
        action taken on top of that would generate normal deficits, not normal 
        budget balance.</p>
      <p>There is a limited set of fiscal actions that satisfy all these conditions. 
        Many of the commonly discussed proposals fall short on at least one ground. 
        By way of illustration, I will discuss a few that have been mentioned 
        in recent debates.</p>
      <p><i>Extend unemployment insurance</i>. Unemployment insurance benefits 
        run out after twenty-six weeks in the United States. In general having 
        a time limit to control caseloads is helpful--the basic idea of unemployment 
        insurance is to provide temporary, not permanent, support to unemployed 
        workers. But in recessions, when unemployed workers have much more difficulty 
        in getting new jobs, it may make sense for policy to be more lenient by 
        extending time limits. Such extensions have been enacted in nearly all 
        postwar U.S. recessions. The extensions would provide benefits to unemployed 
        workers who might have trouble maintaining their pre-unemployment standard 
        of living, implying that the extensions should stimulate consumption spending. 
        The extensions, say to thirty-nine weeks, could be made for a defined 
        period, such as a year. Even if the period exceeded a year, most of the 
        budget dollars would be reversed as workers would naturally be better 
        able to get jobs and would not be remaining on the unemployment rolls. 
        This is one action that seems to satisfy all three conditions.</p>
      <p><i>Accelerate scheduled cuts in tax rates</i>. If future tax-rate cuts 
        are already enacted into law, putting them into effect sooner than planned 
        could be done quickly. Presumably the relevant political compromises have 
        already been made. As the acceleration would not damage the long-run budget 
        position, the reversibility condition is satisfied. But that property 
        could lessen the effect of the rate cuts. It has been found that consumers 
        spend relatively little out of one-shot increases in their income. They 
        spend much more when tax cuts are viewed as permanent rather than one-time 
        events. Since rational, forward-looking consumers should view accelerated 
        rate cuts as one-shot increases in income, the effect of these cuts on 
        consumption could be limited. On the other hand, if consumers are not 
        forward-looking but wait for their tax cuts before they begin spending, 
        the accelerated rate cuts could stimulate a normal amount of consumer 
        spending. In this case accelerated rate cuts could satisfy all three conditions.</p>
      <p>If one changed the tax policy expectations, the overall verdict is, if 
        anything, less favorable. Suppose households did not expect proposed future 
        rate cuts to become law. In such cases, moving up rate cuts might have 
        a stronger perceived effect on permanent income and consumption and more 
        clearly satisfy the impact test. But the same action might take the general 
        budget out of long-term balance, at least as far as bond markets are concerned, 
        and would fail the reversibility test. In this latter case, the accelerated 
        tax cuts satisfy only two conditions.</p>
      <p><i>Temporary cuts in payroll taxes</i>. One could also respond to recessions 
        by cutting payroll taxes for a limited period. The cuts could be made 
        quickly, satisfying the first requirement. But as with income taxes, if 
        rates are cut only for a short time, the funds will appear to be temporary 
        to consumers, in which case their effect on consumption may not be very 
        large. </p>
      <p>Another problem with changing payroll taxes involves the fact that virtually 
        all of them are now devoted to entitlement trust funds such as social 
        security. The social security trust fund is already underfunded in a long-term 
        actuarial sense, and payroll-tax revenues could not be removed from the 
        fund, even for a short period, without raising the long-term actuarial 
        deficit. Moreover, one would not want to start the tradition of using 
        a long-term program to fund short-term needs--soon no long-term program 
        would exist. Thus, if payroll taxes were to be cut, the fiscal flows would 
        have to be kept separate from the social security system. Income taxes 
        would need to be cut by an amount that workers would otherwise have paid 
        into the fund as payroll taxes, without actually taking money from the 
        fund itself. Such logistical complications could be difficult to work 
        out and could lead to delays in enactment or implementation. </p>
      <p><i>Temporary cuts in sales taxes</i>. A fast-acting, short-term measure 
        with a powerful spending impact is a temporary cut in sales taxes. Whereas 
        temporary income-tax cuts can be viewed as making a one-shot change in 
        household disposable income, temporary sales-tax cuts bring about a temporary 
        reduction in the prices of goods that consumers buy. The switch from a 
        temporary income change to a temporary price change makes all the difference. 
        The government is offering a sale on consumption goods and consumers should 
        respond by raising consumption. The period of reduction should be kept 
        reasonably short, to encourage households to take advantage of the favorable 
        terms. It appears that this measure might satisfy all three tests.</p>
      <p>The only problem with temporary sales-tax cuts at the federal level is 
        that the federal government does not impose any sales taxes. Most states 
        do. Hence, for this measure to be effective, the federal government must 
        give grants to those state governments that cut their sales taxes, roughly 
        in the amount of the revenue lost to states from the cuts. Other arrangements 
        might need to be made for the few states that do not impose sales taxes. 
        Our supposedly quick program just got a bit more complicated, and one 
        can easily imagine various states arguing about the revenue flows in the 
        bill, holding up passage until the cyclical need has passed.</p>
      <p><i>Temporary inducements for investment</i>. Following the same principles, 
        the federal government, which does levy corporate taxes, could offer a 
        sale on investment goods. Until 1986, the normal way of doing this was 
        with a temporary investment credit. But the new tax laws make such a measure 
        much more difficult. What can be done instead is to offer a temporary 
        acceleration of depreciation allowances. As with temporary sales-tax reductions, 
        making the period reasonably short could accelerate investment expenditures 
        to the time when aggregate demand is weakest.<br>
        A pro and a con are associated with focusing on investment instead of 
        consumption. The advantageous feature is that investment represents capital 
        deepening--the whole goal of keeping the long-run general government budget 
        in balance is to encourage an investment-oriented economy. The con is 
        that investment is already a more volatile spending component than consumption. 
        If the temporary investment inducements are not timed to coincide with 
        the cyclical dip in investment, they could exacerbate investment cycles 
        and instability. But under some circumstances the investment inducements 
        could pass all three tests.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
        The important point is to establish the right long-run policy framework, 
        with general budget fiscal policy aimed at establishing budget balance 
        on average over the cycle and entitlement trust fund policy aimed at making 
        these programs actuarially sound over the long run. Monetary policy should 
        be aimed at long-run price stability, with short-term flexibility in response 
        to demand conditions. The fiscal measures and the monetary commitment 
        to price stability stimulate investment, productivity, and technological 
        change over the long term. The flexible monetary policy and the automatic 
        fiscal stabilizers provide the economy with shock absorbers to smooth 
        out business cycles.</p>
      <p>The unanswered question then involves the role of discretionary fiscal 
        changes-- are they a valuable addition to this macroeconomic strategy? 
        To be valuable, the measures should stimulate spending, take effect quickly, 
        and be easily reversible. A number of temporary tax changes might do the 
        job, but if they do not stimulate spending, their enactment is delayed, 
        or if they are not easily reversible, they might do little more than to 
        undermine the long-run fiscal strategy. The outcome ultimately depends 
        on the details of the program, the speed of enactment, and the ease of 
        reversibility.<br>
