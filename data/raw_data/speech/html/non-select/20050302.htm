<p> An old saw has it that
central bankers are paid to worry. They are supposed to look past any
superficial good news and try to discern longer-run problems--perhaps inflation
heating up, perhaps something else. For a central banker, every silver lining
has a cloud.</p>

<p> The present time provides
a good illustration. We are just completing the forecasting season, at which
time various economists make their projections. The Blue Chip survey of
leading business forecasters predicts that the growth of real gross domestic
product will average 3.5 percent over the next two years and that unemployment
rates will decline slightly. Unemployment rates are near their normal, or
equilibrium, level, yet these forecasters still look for basic stability in
core inflation rates. According to the Blue Chip survey, investment should
grow at healthy rates, and productivity growth should remain strong. In these
forecasts, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising short-term interest
rates toward their equilibrium level. It all seems pretty healthy--what is
there to worry about?</p>

<p> Well, unfortunately, there
could be something to worry about, and that is what I want to talk about
today. It is the nation's low national saving rate, basically the share of our
output that is devoted to building up the country. This share can be defined either
as the share of output not consumed either by households or government, or as
the share of output devoted to capital investment less the share represented by
borrowing from foreigners. The last clause is important--high investment is a
good thing, but if much of this investment is financed by borrowing from
foreigners rather than by our own saving, there could be trouble spots down the
road. Whether there will be such trouble spots, I don't know. That is
another issue I'd like to discuss.</p>


<p><b>National Saving</b><br> As important as I think it
is, national saving has always been relegated to the B list of economic
measures. When economic data are released, there is always a great deal of
attention to overall output, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and
budget and trade deficits. National saving rates have a lot to do with
shaping each of these variables, but one searches in vain for mention of such
rates. Today I am going to elevate national saving rates to center stage.</p>

<p> I begin with a simple
identity, taken from the national income accounts:</p>

<p align="center">NS = S - BD = I - B</p>

<p>The left side of this identity
covers the sources of national saving (NS), which are private saving in the
economy (S) less budget deficits (BD). Budget deficits are subtracted because
budget deficits imply that private saving is in part going to pay for the
deficits of the government and not going into private investment.</p>

<p> The more interesting part
of the equation involves the uses of national saving, given on the right side
of the identity. In an economy closed to international trade and capital
flows, the long-time staple of undergraduate macroeconomics classes, national
saving equals just domestic investment (I), which is spending on new capital
equipment. This is the spending that raises productivity and output in the
long run, and for that reason it is of special interest. But since economies
are now open to international trade and capital flows, the identity must also
account for the portion of national saving lent abroad or the portion of investment
financed by borrowing from abroad (B). This is done by deducting B, essentially
the nation's current account deficit (through another accounting identity of
which I will spare you discussion).</p>

<p> One value of writing out
the national saving identity is to bring out an important short-run, long-run
dichotomy. In the short-run, international borrowing can go up or down
depending on cyclical movements, exchange rates, and a host of other factors.
Very few countries do without any international borrowing or lending in a
particular year. But over a longer period of time international borrowing
kept close to zero stabilizes a country's ratio of international obligations to
its gross domestic product (GDP).<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>
When this liability ratio is stable, a nation's saving is implicitly financing
most of its domestic investment. Persistent borrowing, keeping investment
above saving, may be possible, but it is not common, and in any case it
automatically implies a buildup of international liabilities relative to its
national output. If a nation wants to have its investment and not pay
increasing shares of income in interest or dividends, it has to finance this
investment by its own national saving. Or, turning the equation around, high
national saving will raise future living standards whether it finances
investment directly or reduces international borrowing.</p>

<p> A further value in
writing out the identity is to tie all this to budget and current account
deficits, which are the focus of much popular discussion. In a word, both
deficits are subtraction items. Budget deficits reduce national saving by, as
I said earlier, siphoning off some private saving to pay for government
deficits. Current account deficits can be associated with low national saving
if a nation borrows to finance its investment. Some economists talk about a "twin
deficit" scenario in which budget deficits lead to current account deficits
of exactly the same size. There are macroeconomic scenarios that can lead to
that result, and these, according to the equation, imply that investment and
private saving move together or are fixed. But it is also possible to imagine
many scenarios in which budget and current account deficits move independently.
These deficits are certainly linked through their impact on national saving,
but they are not twins.</p>

<p> Finally, the numbers.
National saving rates can be given in two ways, either by comparing gross
national saving with gross domestic product, or by subtracting depreciation
from both sides and comparing net national saving with net domestic product. It
turns out not to matter for this discussion--by either definition, national
saving rates are at a post-World War II low. The numbers since the mid-1960s
are shown in <a href="#fig_1" name="fig1">figure 1</a>. As suggested in the preceding discussion, when national
saving rates are this low, the nation suffers from some combination of low
investment and high borrowing. The former is bad from the standpoint of
future productivity, the latter is likely not sustainable. Neither situation is
desirable.</p>

<p><b>Sources Side</b><br> National saving has
dropped because private saving rates have dropped, especially those for
households.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>
Moreover, in recent years federal budget deficits have shot up. From a national
saving point of view, the rise in deficits would not be particularly alarming
if private saving rates were high, nor would the decline in private saving
rates be particularly alarming if the budget were in surplus. But the
combination of low private saving rates and deficits can lead to problems.</p>

<p> While there are ways to
influence private saving rates by policy measures, changes in national saving for
the most part follow changes in fiscal policy.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
<a href="#fig_2" name="fig2">Figure 2</a> shows the historical path for fiscal policy, specifically the federal
deficit (in effect consigning state and local governments to the private
sector). The dotted line shows the primary deficit, which is the total federal
deficit less interest payments, as a share of GDP. To stabilize the ratio of the
stock of federal debt to GDP, this primary deficit should be kept close to zero.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>
The solid line gives just this federal debt to GDP ratio.</p>

<p> When viewed in a
historical context the federal deficit picture does not look particularly
troubling. The primary deficit ratio has cycled around zero, and the debt-GDP
ratio has cycled between 25 and 50 percent. The debt-GDP ratio had a long
downswing in the 1960s and early 1970s, followed by a long upswing in the
1980s. The United States ran fairly large primary surpluses in the 1990s,
enough so to inspire talk of paying off the entire outstanding federal debt.
But that brief period of good fortune has passed; primary deficits are back,
and the debt-GDP ratio is rising again.</p>

<p> For the intermediate
future, the picture worsens somewhat. Recently, the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) made projections for the next decade. One of their scenarios
took the so-called baseline budget, added in likely military spending for Iraq
and Afghanistan, extended the recently enacted tax cuts, and adjusted the
alternative minimum tax for inflation.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>
Under these assumptions, the recent turn for the worse is likely to be reversed
only slowly. The primary deficit averages around 2 percent of GDP for the
next few years before gradually shrinking, and the debt-GDP ratio climbs back
to about 45 percent by 2015. But these projections include only relatively
certain budget obligations, and one can be forgiven for fearing that the actual
numbers will turn out to be worse than the CBO projections, as they often do
through no fault of the CBO. Hence, the medium-term projections do not give
much reason for thinking that the downward pressure on overall national saving
rates will be quickly reversed.</p>

<p> If the medium term looks
uncertain, the far future looks much worse. As is well known, the population
of the United States is aging, and in a few decades a much larger share of the
population will be in its retirement years, drawing on both Social Security and
Medicare. The share of output devoted to these two programs will rise
rapidly, putting even further downward pressure on national saving rates. The
trends, especially for Medicare, are so alarming that these two programs alone
could, in the space of little more than a decade, account for about half of
federal spending. Changes have to be made in these large entitlement programs
to avoid a real fiscal disaster.</p>

<p> Of course changes can be
made. While there are as yet not a great number of feasible ideas for significantly
reducing the cost of Medicare, there are a number of proposals to reform Social
Security. The President is touting a proposal, and ten years ago as chair of
another Presidential advisory council on Social Security, I devised a proposal
of my own.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>
This is not the place to get into a full discussion of Social Security reform
proposals, but one aspect of Social Security reform is important. Given the
low national saving rates, and the fact that many American households do not
save enough to avoid a big cut in their standard of living in retirement, it
would seem desirable to have Social Security reforms that also raise national
saving. One obvious and immediate way to do that would be to raise payroll
taxes; another obvious, and perhaps less painful, way to do that would be to
have individual accounts on top of Social Security. If these "add-on"
individual accounts were to be mandated, as I proposed, those households who
already save amply could reduce their other individual accounts while those who
do no private saving for retirement would be forced to do more. Hence national
saving would be increased, and increased for just those households who
presently do little saving.</p>

<p> Other types of Social
Security reform seem less promising from a national saving point of view. If,
for example, the individual accounts were to be "carved out" of
present payroll tax payments, as President Bush has recently proposed, household
saving would go up but government saving, in the first instance, would go down by
the same amount, meaning that the initial impact on overall national saving would
be nil. But carve-out individual accounts might eventually reduce saving because
households getting individual accounts who are already saving for retirement might
cut back on their pre-existing saving. Hence carve-out individual accounts
seem more likely to reduce than increase national saving. This is not the
only criterion for judging between add-on and carve-out individual accounts,
but I think it is an important one. </p>

<p> There may also be some
way to compromise between mandatory add-on individual accounts that raise
national saving but could be a tough sell politically, and carve-out individual
accounts that are not likely to raise national saving. Some have suggested
raising employee pension contribution rates by automatic default options for employer
defined-contribution account. Under such a plan employees would be
automatically enrolled in the employer's plan and would have to "opt out"
to reject participation. Moreover, firms could be forced to carry employer defined-contribution
accounts, as is done in Ireland.</p>

<p> Other measures that might
raise national saving are tax incentives to increase private saving, such as
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). These essentially reduce or eliminate
the taxation of interest income and hence provide a price inducement for
households to save more. While such measures are often advertised as ways to
increase saving, one must be very careful. On one side, many households can
easily claim the tax advantages by diverting existing assets into IRAs and not
saving any more. On the other side, IRAs entail a federal revenue loss and a
rise in deficits. Since national saving is defined as private saving less
deficits, the larger deficits can actually make national saving decline in
response to a measure that purports to increase national saving. If the
private saving effect were large enough and the revenue loss small, it is also
possible that IRAs would have the anticipated effect of increasing national
saving. One cannot give a purely theoretical answer to the question--it
depends on how the numbers come out.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a>
For years the economics profession has been engaged in a strenuous debate about
these numbers, but it should be noted that overall household and national
saving rates have declined significantly since IRA-type provisions were first
introduced to the tax code. </p>

<p> Even the mortgage
interest deduction can enter in to the question. Through this deduction,
households can borrow, add to their mortgage, reduce their taxes, and invest
the proceeds in IRAs. Hence the mere presence of the mortgage interest
deduction means that IRA-type measures, or consumption tax measures, that purport
to increase private saving will, in fact, not increase private saving and could
reduce national saving. That is why consumption-tax reform measures that omit
treatment of the mortgage interest deduction are unlikely to promote national
saving.</p>

<p><b>Uses Side</b><br> We have seen that
national saving is likely to continue to be low, the result of a combination of
low personal saving in the presence of possibly persisting budget deficits. As
was mentioned, this sets up a difficult quandary--either investment will have
to decrease, lowering future productivity, or international borrowing will have
to continue at high levels, raising international liability ratios. The real
question is whether the large-scale borrowing is sustainable.</p>

<p> The historical record for
the United States, presented in a form similar to that for budget deficits, is
shown in <a href="#fig_3" name="fig3">figure 3</a>. Again, the dotted line is the primary deficit ratio, which
in the case of international accounts is just the trade deficit. The solid
line is the ratio of net international liabilities to domestic GDP, a measure
of the nation's ability to afford its liabilities. As recently as 1985, net U.S.
liabilities to foreigners were zero. But since 1990 the United States has
embarked on a long-term period of high trade deficits, and now the
international liability rate is close to 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply.
International wealth portfolios are getting increasingly heavy in
dollar-denominated assets. How long can this process continue?</p>

<p> We can first examine the
international record. The international deficit that determines the growth or
decline in a country's international liability ratio is the trade deficit, and
there are few cases of countries running large-scale trade deficits for more
than four or five years. By this standard, the U.S. borrowing spurt should
have ended a long time ago. In line with this record, many authors have been
predicting for some time that the combination of interest rates, income, prices,
and exchange rates would adjust to end the U.S. trade deficits.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a>
</p>

<p> But the deficits have not
ended, and international economists are searching for reasons to explain the
situation. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the current situation
meets the apparent needs of many countries. Under this view, which has been
labeled the "co-dependency" view, the United States is permitted to
overconsume through the combination of its inability to cut budget deficits and
its unwillingness to save much privately. Other countries are permitted to
support their export industries by keeping the dollar strong and their own
currencies weak.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a>
These countries in effect create reserves by buying and holding stocks of U.S.
Treasury debt. These international open-market purchases keep the dollar
strong, the home currencies weak, and export industries competitive. Were countries
trying to keep their own currencies strong, they would run out of the foreign
assets to sell to support their own currency. But in keeping the dollar
strong, all central banks have to do is to create reserves, and central banks
can create reserves.</p>

<p> Another possibility is
that other countries, in Europe and much of Asia, have populations that are
aging more rapidly than those in the United States. They may want to build up
a stock of assets to prepare for their own retirement spending crises. Largely
because of the productivity revolution here, these countries have been able to
get better returns on their assets in this country than in their own, and they
have been putting great quantities of saving in world capital markets, perhaps
explaining the present low level of world long-term real interest rates. As a
result, foreigners may be quite willing to accumulate dollar-denominated
assets, and may appreciate the low U.S. national saving rate.</p>

<p> A third possibility is
that the so-called "home bias" in international saving-investment
choices is gradually eroding.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a>
In this view, globalization has generally reduced the barriers to international
asset diversification, and we are witnessing a rebalancing of wealth portfolios
which, in the transition, can lead to persisting current account deficits or
surpluses.</p>

<p> It is very difficult to
tell which of these explanations, or some combination of them, is on the mark
and whether there are unknown fourth or fifth explanations. In each case
there is an international self-interest argument to explain the situation, and
it is difficult to assess the durability of this self-interest. The
co-dependency view could have a natural stopping point when foreign central
banks begin to worry about their heavy asset concentration in
dollar-denomination assets and diversify their stock. The world-saving view
could have a natural stopping point when the populations of the accumulating
countries begin to retire, run down their assets, and sell their
dollar-denominated assets to support the consumption of retirees. The disappearing-home-bias
view could have a natural stopping point when wealth portfolios are
rebalanced. This is all new and unexplored territory.</p>

<p> But determining what explanation
may be correct and stable may also be somewhat beside the point. However
stable the underlying phenomena, it is much more stable for the United States
to increase its own national saving and finance its own investment. This
approach would support investment in the short run and make this investment
more profitable in the long run, because the returns on capital would not be
sent abroad. Other countries may still invest their saving here, but the
United States would have a higher base of its self-financed investment. This
situation would seem to be far and away the preferred course from a
risk-management standpoint.</p>

<p> Under such an approach,
which I will term co-independence, the United States would gradually cut its
budget deficit. Doing so would reduce aggregate demand and hence require
other changes to preserve full employment. One such change would be that
currency rates might shift in the direction of increasing U.S. net exports.
To the extent that stimulation of net exports did not offset the fiscal actions
fully, there is always monetary accommodation. One of the key mandates of the
Federal Reserve is to preserve sustainable employment levels, and the Fed
certainly could do that.</p>

<p> In this strategy, other
countries would have two requirements. To the extent that currency rates
might need to adjust to restore international balance, foreign central banks
should permit normal market readjustments. And to the extent that foreign net
exports might decline as the United States cut its own trade deficits, foreign
countries may need to stimulate their own economies, which they could do with
some combination of monetary and fiscal policy. The result would be to preserve
full employment around the world but with reduced capital account imbalances.</p>


<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
The message here could be
worrisome but is really designed to provoke action. In the short run, output
growth is healthy and inflation rates are stable. Investment shares are
reasonable, but that is largely because the United States is borrowing such a
huge amount from world capital markets. The key question is whether this borrowing
is sustainable. </p>

<p> However sustainable it
is, the United States would seem well-advised to minimize risks by raising its
own national saving to finance its own investment. That would stabilize
investment in the short run and increase profitability in the long run. It
could raise national saving with some combination of fiscal tightening
and measures to raise private saving, coupled with other measures, here and
abroad, to increase demand throughout the world economy. </p>

The precise proposition is that the primary, or noninterest, component of both
budget and current account deficits must remain close to zero to stabilize the
ratio of debt to national output. For a demonstration see Edward M. Gramlich

Economists have a Ricardian equivalence exception--national saving rates do not
follow changes in fiscal policy if private households offset fiscal actions
with their own saving. In general, the evidence does not support this
proposition. See Douglas W. Elmendorf and N. Gregory Mankiw (1999),
