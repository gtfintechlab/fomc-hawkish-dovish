    <TD> <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank the SWIFT 
        organization for inviting me to speak to you about disaster recovery and 
        business continuity, one of the main topics you have been discussing this 
        week. It has now been a little more than one year since the events of 
        September 11. Since then, bankers and the regulatory authorities in various 
        financial centers have been intensively discussing new business-continuity 
        challenges. This forum is very important for two reasons. First, SWIFT 
        itself is a critical service provider for the largest financial institutions 
        and markets. SWIFT&#8217;s efforts to provide leadership in strengthening 
        business continuity are both welcome and important. Second, the annual 
        Sibos meetings bring together financial industry leaders from around the 
        world to discuss common issues affecting funds transfer, securities clearing, 
        and other payment and settlement businesses. The people at this conference 
        have both the responsibility and the experience to address serious common 
        issues involving disaster recovery and business continuity. This afternoon 
        I would like to share some thoughts with you about business-continuity 
        challenges and to discuss a white paper on this topic that regulators 
        in the United States have recently published for public consultation. 
        I would also like to underscore the opportunities and responsibilities 
        that financial firms and their financial utilities have in this new environment.</p>
      <p><strong> Lessons from September 11 about business continuity in financial 
        markets</strong><br>
        One of the essential lessons of September 11 is that the human spirit 
        is both noble and resilient in the face of tragedy. Many acts of heroism 
        have been recorded. I am sure that many more have not been recorded. Unparalleled 
        cooperation in the financial markets supported both assistance to those 
        in need and resumption of day-to-day operations. In the end, although 
        the financial markets quickly returned to normal operations, I hope that 
        we have learned from our experiences and are able, in a continuing spirit 
        of cooperation, to address the vulnerabilities of the financial industry 
        that were revealed by those events. </p>
      <p> It is critical that we vigorously address the possibility of terrorist 
        attacks in areas where major financial markets or operational centers 
        are concentrated. In discussions with financial institutions, someone 
        typically asks, What are the specific threats or scenarios that we need 
        to guard against? The answer to this question is not easy because law-enforcement 
        officials and knowledgeable experts discuss a wide range of scenarios, 
        including some with very serious consequences. In addition, the next event 
        may be the one that we have not foreseen. We have therefore concluded 
        that, for key planning purposes, financial institutions and financial 
        authorities should place more emphasis on the potential effects of regional 
        disruptions than on the potential sources of those disruptions.</p>
      <p> At the national and international level, we must focus on the systemic 
        risk that could result from large-scale, regional disruptions in one or 
        more financial centers. In a recent white paper issued jointly by the 
        Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission, and the New York State Banking Department, we identified critical 
        financial markets in the United States. These include the markets for 
        federal funds, foreign exchange, and commercial paper, as well as the 
        markets for government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, 
        most of these markets are closely integrated with global financial markets 
        with respect to institutional participation and liquidity management as 
        well as pricing and overall risk management.</p>
      <p> From working with clearing organizations and private financial firms 
        since September 11, we know that they are taking steps to reassess their 
        vulnerabilities to regional events. They have strong incentives to strengthen 
        their own resiliency. Their counterparties expect it. The regulatory community 
        has also been working hard to strengthen the foundations of critical markets, 
        for three reasons. First, because clearing and settlement functions are 
        performed as part of an interdependent network of activity, there is a 
        concern that the incentives of one organization to strengthen resilience 
        may not fully reflect either the impact of its loss on others or the benefits 
        of its greater resilience for the entire market. Second, there is a concern 
        that in times of cost pressures organizations may be tempted to overly 
        discount the risk of future regional events. Third, there is a concern 
        that competitive pressures will lead some firms to delay improvements 
        in resilience in the hope that others will shoulder the responsibility. 
        In other words, there is a concern that some private organizations may 
        not make sufficient and consistent investments in resilience for the sake 
        of the industry as a whole.</p>
      <p> In addition, over the past thirty years the clearing and settlement 
        infrastructure has become increasingly concentrated in the United States 
        and in some other countries as financial firms have pursued the advantages 
        of economies of scale and invested in technology to reduce costs and streamline 
        procedures. In Europe, this process accelerated following the introduction 
        of the euro. Not surprisingly, the overall consolidation of infrastructure 
        has been accompanied by increasing technical linkages and interdependence 
        within and across markets. In this type of environment, significant single 
        points of failure within clearing and settlement processes can have far-reaching 
        effects throughout the financial markets.</p>
      <p> To address these concerns, the regulatory community has adopted a strategy 
        to help reduce systemic risk from regional disruptions to the clearing 
        and settlement infrastructure. This strategy has three broad components: 
        first, prevention; second, management; third, testing and assurance. The 
        objective is to reduce the probability that a regional event would bring 
        critical financial markets to a standstill and to ensure the smooth operation 
        of critical infrastructure, if possible. Another objective is to allow 
        the most active firms, at a minimum, to wind up transactions, manage the 
        related financial risk, and to resume trading as soon as commercially 
        reasonable.</p>
      <p><strong> Sound practices</strong><br>
        Our recent white paper sets out several sound practices to achieve these 
        objectives. To help prevent and contain the effects of a regional event, 
        financial utilities and critical firms should regionally diversify their 
        back offices and operational sites that support clearing and settlement 
        for critical markets. In particular, primary operations and backup operations 
        need to be significantly more diverse in order to meet the greater regional 
        risks. The old model of having primary and backup operations centers in 
        close proximity so that they can be served by a common labor pool does 
        not address the possibility of a significant threat to an entire region 
        and labor pool.</p>
      <p> To help manage a regional event, the white paper sets out as a sound 
        practice that financial utilities should plan to recover and fully resume 
        operations on an intraday basis. The paper notes that an emerging sound 
        practice is for these utilities to plan to recover and to resume operations 
        within two hours or less. Of course, actual recovery times will depend 
        on circumstances. However, the objective of rapid intraday recovery provides 
        an important focal point for planning and testing by both utilities and 
        their financial institution customers. I should note that the Federal 
        Reserve&#8217;s own current recovery objectives for Fedwire are much more 
        aggressive than two hours.</p>
      <p> The paper recognizes clearly that financial firms&#8217; ability to 
        recover their overall operations is critically dependent on their financial 
        utilities. This means, in general, that the utilities will have to recover 
        and resume operations more quickly than their participants in order to 
        enable those participants and the overall market to recover in an orderly 
        way. Many financial institutions are shareholders and board members as 
        well as participants in private-sector utilities. It will be very important 
        for the management of these utilities and their shareholder-participants 
        to work closely to ensure that the recovery and resumption strategies 
        of both the utilities and the participants meet sound practices and are 
        consistent with one another.</p>
      <p> The white paper also proposes that firms that play significant roles 
        in critical financial markets should plan to recover their operations 
        sufficiently so that they can clear and settle trades that have already 
        been executed, as well as complete funds-transfer and other critical operations, 
        on the same business day that an event occurs. The paper notes that an 
        emerging sound practice in the industry would call on these significant 
        players to plan to recover in four hours or less, again depending somewhat 
        on circumstances. </p>
      <p> To help prepare for a regional event, the white paper encourages greater 
        contingency and assurance testing. As we learned from Y2K and again from 
        September 11, testing is one of the vital elements of contingency planning. 
        Our white paper recommends that financial utilities and firms that play 
        significant roles in critical markets routinely use or test their recovery 
        and resumption arrangements for the required connectivity, functionality, 
        and capacity. </p>
      <p> In particular, greater testing between the backup facilities of financial 
        utilities and the backup facilities of their critical members would help 
        the clearing and settlement infrastructure perform more smoothly in the 
        event of a regional disruption. Much more coordinated testing among utilities 
        and firms serving different markets would also help in the management 
        of problems involving cross-market clearing and settlement linkages. Obviously, 
        in preparing for Y2K we engaged in very large-scale testing. In the current 
        context we understand that there may ultimately be diminishing returns 
        from repeated testing and that we must learn from our experiences in preparing 
        for Y2K. The industry again is working together to help define reasonable 
        and meaningful tests and to cooperate by participating in them. In the 
        United States, the Federal Reserve and Clearing House Interbank Payments 
        System (CHIPS) have already coordinated their test schedules. The Federal 
        Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s Payment Risk Committee, the Securities 
        Industry Association, and the Banking Industry Technology Secretariat 
        are working together to address testing and similar issues. As I have 
        said before, this spirit of cooperation in addressing critical, cross-industry 
        problems of business continuity and testing is welcome.</p>
      <p> SWIFT played a very important role in preparations for Y2K and since 
        September 11 has been working to share ideas and coordinate testing with 
        other organizations. I hope the results of your meetings this week will 
        provide additional ideas and the ongoing support necessary to address 
        the difficult issues involved in strengthening the industry&#8217;s level 
        of testing. SWIFT clearly can play an important role in promoting and 
        facilitating testing. More broadly, SWIFT can adopt and foster emerging 
        best practices for business continuity.</p>
      <p><strong> Challenges in addressing the risks of regional disruptions</strong><br>
        I would now like to identify three primary challenges in implementing 
        a strategy to address regional disruptions. These challenges involve people, 
        business, and technology.</p>
      <p> In developing strategies for regional disruption, we must recognize 
        that the safety of people--our colleagues, employees, and their families--is 
        paramount. Different strategies of regional diversification, along with 
        efforts to strengthen security and crisis response within regions, will 
        help protect our people. One of the challenges that we face, however, 
        is how to increase individual safety without losing the efficiencies that 
        we have gained from concentrating staff and expertise at critical geographic 
        locations. </p>
      <p> The effect of regional diversification on business also presents challenges. 
        Firms will both incur costs and reap benefits with diversification, but 
        it is often difficult to justify adding costs to address contingencies. 
        Firms inevitably have a number of strategic priorities and projects that 
        contend for resources. We also recognize that some firms are in different 
        positions than others in addressing regional issues. Some firms have a 
        national or international &#8220;footprint&#8221; that makes it somewhat 
        easier to take important measures to diversify operational centers and 
        back-office operations. Others, because of historical circumstances or 
        regional specialization, have harder decisions to make. These issues are 
        always difficult.</p>
      <p> Firms that play significant roles in critical markets, in particular, 
        need to think very carefully about the new situation we are facing, along 
        with their importance to their customers, counterparties, and the markets 
        generally. At the highest levels of major firms, there is a real need 
        for leadership in dealing with an issue that goes beyond ordinary business 
        decisions. Our white paper asks a series of questions about how to identify 
        critical firms that need to adopt sound practices for regional diversification 
        and seeks guidance on cost and similar issues. </p>
      <p> The third important challenge involves technology. Some key technologies 
        for data storage and communication do not accommodate regional diversification 
        as readily as we all would like. The challenge here will be to modify 
        existing arrangements, solve technological problems, and find new ways 
        to facilitate diversification. I am sure that the firms attending Sibos 
        are very aware of these issues, and I trust that the market for these 
        technologies will see a flow of very creative solutions over the coming 
        months.</p>
      <p> I would like to add a note about telecommunications. We have known for 
        some time that our progress in automating the financial markets has made 
        us highly dependent on telecommunications. In our own discussions within 
        the Federal Reserve and our discussions with others, the issue of telecommunications 
        circuit diversity is very important. I encourage firms to take this issue 
        seriously and to discuss it with individual telecommunications providers, 
        industry groups, and appropriate government officials.</p>
      <p><strong> Conclusion</strong><br>
        In taking the next steps to strengthen the foundations of our critical 
        financial markets, we need to constantly remember how dependent we are 
        on one another. We will not accomplish our task if one or two organizations 
        strengthen their resilience and others do not. Instead, we need to work 
        hard to adopt consistent strategies to meet regional risks that together 
        address prevention, management, and testing.</p>
      <p> The importance of creating and maintaining a highly resilient financial 
        services sector is self-evident. Similarly, the challenges to achieving 
        that goal are numerous, involving, as I indicated, people, business, and 
        technology. Given the importance and complexity of this topic, senior 
        management will need to become fully engaged.</p>
      <p> At the international level, the openness of our financial systems means 
        that the business-continuity practices in one country can affect critical 
        markets in another. We will therefore need to share information and sound 
        practices that will help us address regional risks in various countries. 
        At this stage, this does not necessarily mean traditional regulatory coordination. 
        Rather, private firms and the financial authorities will need to work 
        together within their various communities and with each other to make 
        our key business-continuity practices more robust and more consistent.</p>
      <p> We also need to recognize that new business-continuity strategies need 
        to be practical. We are looking forward to receiving the views of market 
        participants and other knowledgeable experts to help ensure that the final 
        white paper ultimately sets out sound practices that are well grounded 
        and practical. As we work through these new challenges, however, we must 
        keep in mind that to do nothing would leave serious risks unaddressed. 
      </p>
      <p> I would like to close by noting the importance of our financial centers. 
        These cities are a source of work, play, and inspiration for millions 
        of people. These cities need to be vibrant and resilient, even as new 
        challenges arise for security and stability. Our financial policies to 
        address new regional challenges should be designed to strengthen the resilience 
        of these great centers and their people, not to abandon them. The regional 
        diversification of back offices and operational sites is intended as a 
        prudent strategy that will enable financial centers and their markets 
        to continue to serve as robust sources of economic progress.</p></td>
