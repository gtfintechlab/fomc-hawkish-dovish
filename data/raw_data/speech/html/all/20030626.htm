<TD>
<p>Much has been said about the challenges for monetary policymakers in the current 
        low-interest-rate environment. It is important to note that the same economic 
        forces that are confronting the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market 
        Committee (FOMC) are also creating new management challenges for the banking 
        industry. 
      <p>Because we are now in a blackout period following yesterday's FOMC meeting, 
        I will not comment on monetary policy. Instead, I will focus on the challenges 
        that I see for bank management in a low-interest-rate setting. These views 
        are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on 
        the Board of Governors or the FOMC. 
      <p>After posting record profits in 2002, the United States banking industry 
        produced another new record in the first quarter of this year by generating 
        $24.6 billion in earnings. Growth in core deposits, vibrant mortgage banking 
        activity, and improved asset quality are some of the major factors contributing 
        to the strong earnings performance. 
      <p>A close examination of the first-quarter call report data, however, indicates 
        significant changes in banks' balance sheets and income statements that 
        reflect how the banking industry has adapted in this low-interest-rate 
        environment. Let me first review some of these changes, then discuss what 
        I believe to be the management challenges they present. 
      <p>The most pronounced effect of the current climate has not been prominent 
        in the headlines but is well known to the industry. We have seen remarkable 
        and sustained growth in core deposits, especially money market deposit 
        accounts (MMDAs) and savings accounts. Already a large component of bank 
        balance sheets, these two accounts grew by an astounding 21 percent in 
        2001 and 18 percent in 2002. That growth rate--essentially 5 percent each 
        quarter--continued in the first quarter of this year. MMDAs and savings 
        accounts have historically been characterized as stable and slow-growing. 
        Their remarkable transition to high-growth products reflects both the 
        weak equity market and limited alternatives for higher yields. 
      <p>Now, however, these two types of accounts fund approximately 30 percent 
        of bank assets, which means the composition of bank deposits has changed 
        quite a bit in a short period of time. For many years, banks relied increasingly 
        on short- to medium-term wholesale deposits (foreign time deposits and 
        large dollar, or jumbo, certificates of deposit) to fund much of their 
        asset growth. As recently as year-end 2000, these wholesale deposits accounted 
        for about one-fifth of overall funding, about the same share as MMDAs 
        and savings accounts. Since that time, the remarkable growth in MMDA and 
        savings deposits suggests that the proportion of funds provided by wholesale 
        deposits has fallen off considerably. Smaller certificates of deposit--those 
        under $100,000--have actually declined in absolute terms over the same 
        period. 
      <p>As MMDAs and savings accounts have continued to grow, low interest rates 
        have also affected the pricing of these deposits. The rates paid on these 
        accounts have generally moved in tandem with interest rates on short-term 
        investments such as repos and fed funds. As market interest rates fell 
        to very low levels in 2001, however, the spread between these deposit 
        rates and market rates narrowed considerably. When the average effective 
        rate on MMDAs and savings accounts reached about 1 percent in early 2002, 
        banks seemed to become much more reluctant to reduce their rates on these 
        accounts. <img src="image002a.gif" alt="Chart of Effective Rate on MMDA and Savings Deposits" width="600" height="291"> 
      <p>A second impact of low interest rates has been reflected in mortgage 
        loan activity. Banks have accumulated mortgage-related assets both in 
        their loan portfolios and in the form of mortgage-related securities--in 
        particular, pass-through securities. Taken together, one- to four-family 
        residential mortgage loans and pass-through securities grew by 10 percent 
        in 2001 and by more than 17 percent in 2002. Residential closed-end mortgages 
        and mortgage pass-through securities represented more than 20 percent 
        of bank assets as of March 2003, up from 17.5 percent in 2002. Home equity 
        lines of credit grew at an even more rapid 20 percent in 2001 and 39 percent 
        last year. The underlying economic strength of the U.S. household sector 
        made residential mortgages attractive to banks at a time when business-loan 
        demand was low. 
      <p>The continuing decline in interest rates that fueled the growth in mortgage 
        lending has also, predictably, had an impact on yields in mortgage loan 
        and mortgage securities portfolios. Yields on mortgage-backed securities 
        (MBSs) have declined from 5.63 percent in the first quarter of 2002 to 
        4.58 percent in the first quarter of 2003. This decline of over 100 basis 
        points represents both accelerating prepayments and declining rates for 
        newly issued securities. Non-interest income from mortgage activity was 
        both positively and negatively affected. While mortgage-origination fees 
        increased, prepayment activity reduced the value of mortgage servicing 
        rights and ultimately realization of income from that source. 
      <p>As low interest rates have persisted, the key rate of revenue generation 
        for banks--the net interest margin--has come under considerable downward 
        pressure. Although low market rates initially helped to widen the spreads 
        earned by banks, the industrywide net interest margin declined steadily 
        over the past year, from 4.15 percent in early 2002 to 3.87 percent in 
        the first quarter of 2003. That 28-basis-point decline in one year compares 
        with a 35-basis-point drop during the entire decade 1992 to 2002. <img src="image004a.gif" alt="Chart of Net Interest Margin" width="600" height="288"> 
      <p>The source of this recent margin compression can be traced to two primary 
        influences: the self-imposed restraints in pricing MMDA and savings deposits 
        and movement in the spread between residential mortgage assets and these 
        deposits. In short, the two balance-sheet categories that have been most 
        affected by the current environment appear to explain much of the movement 
        in the industry's net interest margins. <img src="image006a.gif" alt="Chart of Effective Rate on MMDA/Savings vs. MBS Yields" width="600" height="292"> 
      <p>Also contributing to the strong profit performance of the first quarter 
        were securities gains. We have not seen such a sizable contribution to 
        pretax profits from securities gains since 1993. To some extent, these 
        one-time gains have been used to offset well-publicized and unusual expenses 
        related to credit losses and anticipated litigation expenses. Though relatively 
        large, the gains recorded in recent quarters are arguably not out of line 
        with historic experience, if measured as a percentage of total unrealized 
        gains on the securities portfolio. 
      <p><strong>Management Challenges</strong><br>
        Decisions made by bankers in today's unusual interest-rate environment 
        can have important long-term consequences. The compression of interest 
        margins is alerting bankers to the fact that their ample supply of core 
        deposits provides a liquidity cushion that is fairly expensive in this 
        setting. A natural reaction for banks would be to move out on the yield 
        curve to achieve better interest margins. With much of the asset growth 
        for banks being funded by core deposits, it would be natural to assume 
        that savings and MMDA accounts will continue to demonstrate the same relative 
        stability and reliability as in past years. However, past experience indicates 
        that depositors' behavior can change significantly as interest rates change, 
        particularly under unusual or exceptional interest-rate conditions such 
        as we have today. In another period of exceptional interest rates--the 
        late 1970s and early 1980s--many banks that were funding long-term assets 
        with four-and-one-half or six-year certificates of deposit found that 
        depositors were accepting substantial interest penalties--as much as six 
        months' interest--to shorten their maturities and considerably improve 
        their yields. Banks and thrifts then faced significant, and in some cases 
        critical, interest rate risk exposures. 
      <p>Should interest rates return to levels of prior years, banks that rely 
        on their savings accounts and MMDAs to fund long-term assets may be wise 
        to consider the possibility of facing unexpected liquidity or interest 
        rate risk pressures if depositors choose to shift deposit funds into other 
        investment vehicles to enhance the return on their assets. Neither bankers 
        nor supervisors have yet experienced such a situation, and it might present 
        unusual challenges to both parties. For example, in such a setting, banks 
        would be forced to decide whether to adopt deposit-pricing strategies 
        to maximize near-term earning or, alternatively, focus on deposit retention. 
      <p>A second example of how a decision made today might affect future performance 
        involves the large volume of securities gains being recorded by the banking 
        industry. Booking such gains will enhance near-term profits, but only 
        at the price of sacrificing higher-yielding assets from future net interest 
        earnings. 
      <p>If the management challenges of this environment could be reduced to 
        a single issue, that issue would be the need to balance the opportunities 
        of the present with the prospects for the future. Through a surge in core 
        deposits, today's low interest rates have given banks an unusual opportunity 
        to regain deposits lost during the past decade to money market funds and 
        other investments, without the need for massive investment in bricks and 
        mortar. Through judicious management, banks may be able to retain some 
        portion of these gains beyond this period of low interest rates. 
      <p>Now that I have discussed the management challenges posed to bankers 
        by low interest rates, I should note that this environment also affects 
        their customers. Some, such as mortgage borrowers, obviously have benefited. 
        For others, namely depositors on a fixed income, low rates are a challenge. 
        We at the Federal Reserve do assess the impact that changes in interest 
        rates can have on particular segments of the economy, both advantageous 
        and disadvantageous, and we are, of course, aware that people on fixed 
        incomes can be adversely affected as rates decline. The goals of monetary 
        policy, however, are to foster conditions conducive over time to maintaining 
        low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable economic growth. As policymakers, 
        we must make decisions that provide the greatest benefit to the economy 
        overall. When the economy is weak, for example, increasing rates would 
        likely result in further weakness, a result that would not be in our nation's 
        best interest. 
      <p><strong>Today's EGRPRA Meeting</strong><br>
        Adapting to changes like these is part of the banking business. Supervision 
        and regulation must also evolve and adapt to new developments. But shifting 
        regulatory approaches unavoidably leave obsolete regulations in their 
        wake. Business people and bankers in particular complain, certainly with 
        some justification and perhaps with some exaggeration, that so many regulations 
        are on the books that at any given time they are probably unknowingly 
        in violation of some of them. 
      <p>We at the Federal Reserve endeavor to review all of our existing regulations 
        every five years in order to revise or rescind those that are unnecessary 
        or out-of-date. Other banking regulators have adopted a similar approach. 
        The current Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) 
        regulatory review supplements these periodic reviews by the agencies. 
        It provides a unique opportunity for financial institutions, the agencies, 
        and other interested parties to step back and look at groups of related 
        regulations and identify opportunities for streamlining regulatory requirements, 
        implementing other burden-reducing actions, and identifying needed statutory 
        changes. 
      <p>We welcome this opportunity to revisit and streamline our rules. Some 
        improvements can be made by the agencies; others will require congressional 
        legislative action. Both regulatory and congressional efforts to eliminate 
        rules that are not needed to protect the taxpayer are worthwhile. But 
        we can make these improvements only with your help; so we welcome your 
        suggestions. These suggestions can be most productive if you tell us how 
        we can accomplish the goals of regulation--safety and soundness and consumer 
        protection--in a less burdensome way. We look forward to working together--regulators, 
        bankers, and the public--through this interagency EGRPRA review process 
        to rid ourselves of unnecessary regulation and ensure the continued vitality 
        and safety of our banking system. It is in the long-range interest of 
        both bankers and regulators that the ultimate goal of this exercise be 
        to improve both the efficiency and the financial stability of our banking 
        system. </TD>
