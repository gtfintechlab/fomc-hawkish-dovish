<P>	One of the defining characteristics of the recent business expansion in the United States has
been the evident reluctance of corporate managers to expand spending and hiring aggressively in
response to and in anticipation of continued cyclical growth. A substantial rebound in business
spending had been a hallmark of most past economic expansions.  Judging by the pickup in capital
spending in recent quarters, businesses are becoming more confident in the strength and durability of
the cyclical upturn.  Still, over the four quarters ending in March, corporate investment in capital and
inventories likely fell short of rapidly rising cash flow for the first time, over a comparable period,
since the mid-1970s.  Corporate debt expansion has accordingly been tepid.  Indeed, corporate net
bond issuance was negative in May.</P>

<P>	The exceptional reluctance to expand payrolls also appears to have waned this year, and
businesses are once again hiring with some vigor. But for nearly three years prior, managers sought
every avenue to forestall new hiring despite rising business sales.  Their ability to boost output
without adding appreciably to their workforces, appears to have reflected a backlog of unexploited
capabilities to enhance productivity with minimal capital investment, a delayed effect of the capital
goods boom of the 1990s.  Even now, the proportion of increases in temporary workers relative to
total employment gains has been unusually large, suggesting that business caution remains a feature
of the economic landscape. </P>

<P>	This hesitancy on the part of businesses to expand risk-taking, as I have noted in the past, is
an apparent consequence of scandals surrounding corporate accounting and governance, an
aftermath of the stock market surge.  Although there is no compelling evidence that corporate
governance risk has fully subsided, with time, it should.  An increased willingness to borrow, and
ample liquid assets, should provide a further lift to capital investment and, with it, economic activity.</P>

<P align="center">* * *</P>

<P>	With concerns of deflation now presumably safely behind us, developments ahead are likely
to be dominated by the paths of productivity growth and profit margins--assuming, of course, the
always latent danger of terrorism in the United States remains in check.  Profits of nonfinancial
corporations as a share of sector output, after falling to 7 percent in the third quarter of 2001,
rebounded to 12 percent in the first quarter of 2004, a pace of advance not experienced since 1983. 
This sharp recovery in profits reflects, at least in part, the dramatic swing over the past couple of
years from relatively heavy business price discounting to the restoration of a significant degree of
pricing power. </P>

<P>	The most visible manifestation of the return to pricing power can be seen in the recent
acceleration of core consumer prices.  The twelve-month percent change in the core PCE price
index, which stood at just above 0.8 percent in December of last year, was at 1.4 percent in April.</P>

<P>	To better understand recent developments, it is helpful to view prices from the perspective
of consolidated costs and profit margins.  From the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2004,
consolidated unit costs for the nonfinancial corporate business sector declined.  Hence, at least from
an accounting perspective, all of the 1.1 percent increase in the prices of final goods and services
produced in that sector during that period was the consequence of a rise in profit margins.  The
6.4&nbsp;percent increase in nonfinancial corporate business productivity over those four quarters
accounts for much of the decline in unit costs.  The remainder of the decline is accounted for by the
effects of accelerating output in reducing nonlabor fixed costs per unit of output.</P>

<P>	Productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector evidently decelerated somewhat this year. 
Moreover, as best we can judge, the growth of compensation per hour has stepped up in recent
months.  With gains in hourly compensation now apparently outstripping advances in productivity,
unit labor costs have moved up.  Moreover, the increase in overall operating expenses over the last
couple of months has also reflected higher energy costs and rising prices of imported non-oil inputs. 
It seems unlikely, however, that a further rise in profit margins will contribute to significantly higher
prices of final goods and services.  In an endeavor to exploit current high margins, businesses are
being driven to expand their use of capital and labor resources.  If history is any guide, this will tend
to increase both real wages and interest rates.  Fears of losing market share should dissuade
businesses from passing these high costs fully through to prices.  Accordingly, the forces of
competition should cap the rise in profit margins and ultimately return them to more normal levels.</P>

<P>	To date, the aforementioned cost pressures have been relatively subdued.  Nonetheless, the
persistence of the rise in energy prices is a worrisome element in the cost picture.</P>

<P>	Fears for the long-term security of oil production in the Middle East, along with increased
concerns about prospects in other oil-producing countries, are doubtless key factors behind the
nearly $9 per barrel rise in distant crude oil futures since 2000.  This run-up presumably reflects a
broadening of demand for claims on oil inventories beyond traditional commercial buyers and sellers
of crude oil and petroleum products. The marked rise in the net long positions of non-commercial
investors in oil futures and options since May 2003 has increased net claims on an already
diminished global level of commercial crude and product inventories.  Oil prices accordingly have
surged.  </P>

<P>	At some point, however, investors will have achieved the level of claims on oil that they
seek.  When that occurs, their demand will presumably stop rising, thus removing some of the
current upward pressure on prices.  Nonetheless, the increased value of oil imports has been a net
drain on purchasing power, spending, and production in the United States.  Moreover, higher oil
prices, if they persist, are likely to boost core consumer prices, as well as the total price level, in this
country.  The recent modest declines in oil and natural gas prices may or may not signal a trend but
are nonetheless welcome.</P>

<P align="center">* * *</P>

<P>	The end of deflationary fears and the onset of modest upward pressure on costs, coupled
with a strengthening economic outlook in the United States, have driven long-term interest rates
higher, which has spurred a marked shift in credit flows and has prompted many firms to focus on
the possibility of further interest rate increases in developing their hedging strategies.  The rise in
rates, for example, has induced a dramatic fall in mortgage refinancing and, hence, has produced a
pronounced rise in the duration of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  Owing to the volume of the
earlier wave of mortgage refinancing, there is now a paucity of existing mortgages at rates
appreciably above current levels, implying that the extent of further duration hedging is likely to be
quite modest.</P>

<P>	As a consequence of record levels of refinancing in the second half of 2002 and the first half
of 2003--which, by our estimates, encompassed roughly 45 percent of the total value of home
mortgages outstanding--MBS duration fell to exceptionally low levels.  As mortgage and other long-term rates rebounded last summer, a consequence of rapidly improving economic conditions and the
fading of deflationary concerns, refinancing fell sharply, removing most downward pressure on
duration.  Holders of MBS endeavoring to hedge developing interest rate gaps rapidly shed
receive-fixed swaps and Treasuries, and these actions markedly aggravated last summer's long-term
interest rate upturn.</P>

<P>	In recent months, mortgage rates have risen further, suppressing much of what is left of
incentives to refinance, thereby increasing mortgage duration to its current elevated level.  This
suggests that the vast secondary market for home mortgages has largely adjusted to the recent
increases in mortgage rates.</P>

<P>	Moreover, the expectation of Federal Reserve tightening has apparently already induced
other significant balance sheet adjustments as well.  An unwinding of carry trades is notably under
way at least judging from the shift in the trading portfolios of primary dealers.  In addition, a swing
toward a net short position on ten-year Treasury note futures among investors has been the largest
since the inception of the contract in the 1980s.</P>

<P align="center">* * *</P>

<P>	Economic developments going forward will determine the level and term structure of interest
rates.  Federal funds futures prices already reflect expectations of a substantial firming of policy by
the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Unlike 1994, there has been an appreciable
increase of market rates in anticipation of policy tightening, though history cautions that investors'
anticipations of the cumulative magnitude of policy actions and their timing under such circumstances
are far from perfect. </P>

<P>	Lastly, let me emphasize that recent financial indicators, including rapid growth of the money
supply, underscore that the FOMC has provided ample liquidity to the financial system that will
become increasingly unnecessary over time.  The Committee is of the view, as you know, that
monetary policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  That
conclusion is based on our current best judgment of how economic and financial forces will evolve in
the months and quarters ahead.  Should that judgment prove misplaced, however, the FOMC is
prepared to do what is required to fulfill our obligations to achieve the maintenance of price stability
so as to ensure maximum sustainable economic growth.</P>
