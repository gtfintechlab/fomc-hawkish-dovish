	<p>I am very pleased
to join you. Today I want to begin with a brief assessment of the economic
outlook before discussing financial conditions of businesses and households in more
detail. Then, I will turn to some issues related to the management of personal
credit and savings and the greater need that consumers have to improve their
understanding of financial services and providers as the financial marketplace
has expanded. </p>

<p>I also need to add
that I am expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily those of my
colleagues on the Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

<p><b>The Economic Outlook</b><br>
As you know, the
economy has been expanding at a solid pace lately. Real gross domestic product
grew at an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter and growth in the
first quarter looks to have remained solid. Labor markets have continued to improve,
albeit at a slow pace, with private nonfarm payroll employment posting moderate
gains in 2004 and in the first three months of this year. Business outlays for
capital equipment grew robustly in the past two quarters. Consumer spending also
has continued to expand, although higher energy prices may be crimping
household purchases recently. Consumer and business confidence remain
favorable, despite a slight dip in consumer sentiment in early April, and, with
accommodative financial conditions, I expect that the economy will continue to
expand at a solid pace this year. </p>

<p> On the inflation front,
broad measures of consumer inflation have risen somewhat faster than they did
in the year-earlier period, boosted by higher energy prices. Focusing on the
core price index, which excludes food and energy, it too has been a bit higher
than it was the year before, likely reflecting the indirect effects of rising
energy prices and the falling dollar. Productivity is slowing from its
exceptional pace of the past couple years and unit labor costs are again
increasing. Though inflation pressures have risen somewhat in recent months, longer-term
inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained. I believe that,
while underlying inflation is expected to continue to be low, the Federal
Reserve must be more alert to monitoring incoming data, and continue to remove
policy accommodation at a measured pace, consistent with the incoming data and its
commitment to maintain price stability.</p>

<p><b>Financial Conditions of Businesses</b><br>
Business expansion
solidified last year and continued growth by businesses will depend in part on
their financial conditions. So let me take a few minutes to review the
financial position of the business sector, and especially the dramatic improvement
from a few years ago. Since 2001, firms have improved their balance sheet
liquidity, reduced leverage, and restructured their liabilities, responding in
part to investors' concerns arising from some high-profile unanticipated
meltdowns in the early part of this decade. In addition, firms have significantly
cut costs through dramatic gains in productivity, which has boosted profits.
In my view, even with a rise in interest rates and some moderation in profit
growth, the business sector should remain
financially strong and continue to expand.</p>

<p>The improvement in
corporate balance sheets in the past few years has been substantial. Most
noteworthy are the gains achieved in balance sheet liquidity. Firms have taken
advantage of low long-term interest rates to pay down short-term debt with
longer-maturity debt. At the same time, firms have built up their cash
positions to extraordinary levels. At the end of last year, the ratio of cash
and equivalents to short-term debt at nonfinancial corporations stood at about
twice its average level since the 1950s.</p>

<p>In addition, many
firms have taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to refinance
high-cost debt, and others have used profits from operations or asset sales to
retire debt. As a result, interest expense burdens have declined on balance
and nonfinancial corporate debt has grown only modestly in recent years, its
slowest pace since the early 1990s. </p>

<p>These repairs to
balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest
rates, especially in the near term. In particular, the replacement of
short-term debt by long-term bonds means that less debt will have to be rolled
over in the near term at higher rates. In addition, because much of the
long-term debt has a fixed rate, interest payments typically are unaffected
over the life of the bond. Moreover, research by the Board staff suggests that
firms that rely more on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more
vulnerable to rising rates, have in recent years tended to use derivatives to
hedge some of their exposure to interest rate risk. Thus, for many firms, the
effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and spread out over time. </p>

<p>Also, as we
learned from the episode of policy tightening in 1994, rising interest rates
have little detrimental effect on the financial health of the corporate sector
when the rate increases occur in the context of an expanding economy. Indeed,
corporate credit quality improved on balance after 1994 with the pickup in
economic activity and corporate profits.</p>

<p>Some of the
improvement in financial conditions among businesses is due to significant
belt-tightening by many firms. Over the past few years, the drive to cut costs
and boost efficiency has generated rapid productivity gains. Fuller
utilization of the capabilities of capital already in place, ongoing
improvements in inventory management, and streamlined production processes requiring fewer
workers, to name but a few examples of efficiency enhancements, have boosted
corporate profitability. </p>

<p>The pickup in
revenue growth since mid-2002, combined with outsized productivity gains, has
produced a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability. The profits
of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output continued to climb and
reached almost 12 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, up from its
cyclical trough of 7 percent in 2001. This share lies well above its long-run
average over the past few decades. To be sure, the profit share likely will
slip a bit from its high level as the expansion gains steam and businesses hire
new workers more aggressively. But some decline in the profit share is to be
expected and will not, in my view, significantly impair the financial health of
companies. This favorable view is reflected in risk spreads on corporate bonds
and credit default swaps, which have dropped dramatically from their historic
highs in the fall of 2002. </p>

<p><b>Household Financial Conditions</b><br> In the household
sector, some analysts have expressed concern about the rapid growth in
household debt in recent years and the decline in the household saving rate.
They fear that households have become overextended and will need to rein in
their spending to keep their debt burdens under control. My view is
considerably more sanguine. Although pockets of financial stress exist among
households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good shape. </p>

<p> It is true that
households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several years.
According to the latest available data, total household debt grew at an annual
rate of about 10 percent between 1999 and 2004; in comparison, after-tax
household income increased at a rate of about 5 percent over this period. This
rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing,
which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates, strong
growth in house prices, and an increasing share of households owning their home
rather than renting. </p>

<p> Indeed, many homeowners
have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some
having done so several times over the past couple years. Survey data suggest
that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these &quot;refis,&quot;
often to pay down loans having higher interest rates. On net, the resulting
drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the
lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made
by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt. </p>

<p> The Federal Reserve
publishes two data series that quantify the burden of household obligations.
The first series, the debt-service ratio, measures the required payments on
mortgage and consumer debt as a share of after-tax personal income. The second
series, the financial-obligations ratio, is a broader version of the debt-service
ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases,
homeowners insurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s,
and both reached a peak in late 2002. Since then, however, the debt-service
ratio has been stable and the financial obligations ratio has receded a bit, an
indication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on their
financial commitments. Consistent with these patterns, delinquency rates for a
wide range of household loans either have drifted down over the past year or
held about steady at levels below recent highs. </p>

<p>The low interest
rates of the past few years, however, will give way as the economy continues to
expand, and we have already seen an increase in mortgage rates and on some other
consumer loans during this past year. To be sure, some households will be
pressured by the higher rates, but I believe that concerns about their effect
on repayment burdens can be overstated. First, most household debt--mortgage
and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the
adjustment of interest costs to rising rates. Second, although interest rates
on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large
number of variable-rate loans could occur rather slowly. For example, many
adjustable-rate mortgages start off with a fixed rate for several years,
providing households with some protection from rising rates. </p>

<p>Another concern is
that house prices will reverse and erase a considerable amount of home equity
built up in recent years. Recent gains in house prices have been notable: the
average house price rose 11 percent in 2004, and cumulative gains since 1997
now top 65 percent.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>
Despite a rise in mortgage debt, the current loan-to-value ratio for outstanding
mortgages is estimated to be around 45 percent, roughly the level that has
prevailed since the mid-1990s. It is true that some households have
considerably less equity in their homes, and these households tend to have
lower income and fewer other financial assets to cushion shocks. Based on the
2001 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a small share, 7 percent, of households
had a loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent or more. Unfortunately, we cannot
characterize the current share as accurately, at least not until the 2004
survey becomes available later this year, but it is unlikely that the share has
risen by a lot. While new originations of mortgages with high loan-to-value
ratios in recent years would push this share up, the substantial house price
appreciation in that same period likely improved the financial positions of the
households with high loan-to-value ratios in 2001.</p>

<p>However, we are
beginning to see signs that housing prices may be reaching a peak in some
markets. An increasing share of new mortgages is being taken out by investors
rather than by occupants of the property. Some borrowers are stretching to buy
their new homes using adjustable-rate, interest-only mortgages. Not only will
these households face higher monthly payments as interest rates rise, they are
also not building equity in their homes as quickly as they would with a
traditional amortizing mortgage. </p>

<p> Some analysts have also
expressed concerns about the decline in the personal saving rate. Aggregate
personal saving, measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, averaged just
above 1 percent of disposable income in 2004, more than 6 percentage points
lower than the average that has prevailed since the early 1960s. The saving
rate, measured by the Board's flow of funds accounts, is higher, at 4 percent
of disposable income, though it, too, is significantly lower than its average
level in the past. Analysis by Board staff using data from the SCF indicate
that households in the top income quintile can account for nearly all of the
decline in the aggregate saving rate since 1989. Given that these
higher-income households have more financial resources to weather shocks, the
significant decline in savings is less troublesome than if it had occurred in
the lower part of the income distribution. </p>

<p>This comparison
points out two different perspectives on household financial health. While
analysts usually focus on the saving rate as a share of current income and
funds flow, some argue that a more relevant measure of saving adequacy is not
the portion of current income set aside for saving but rather the change in net
worth. And in this regard, the picture of household saving looks more
favorable than suggested by the saving rate. The ratio of net
worth-to-disposable income has come down from its peak in 2000, but remains at
a high level relative to the past few decades, because capital appreciation on
household assets, such as equities and real estate, has considerably outpaced
income gains. This is a passive perspective on savings, though, where
households rely on the markets to raise the value of their assets over time.
But, to create these assets, households need to consistently set aside some of
their current earnings to invest for their future needs. While the experience
of the past few years of exceptionally low interest rates and lower expected
stock returns encouraged a rational consumer to spend and not save, as the
markets return to more long-term trends, we should see consumers moderate their
behavior as well. <b> </b></p>

<p><b>Managing Personal Finances</b><br><b> </b>I now want to
turn from an aggregate view of household finances to savings and credit at the
individual level. In particular, I want to discuss issues relating to managing
personal finances, including managing personal credit and saving for retirement,
and the special importance of financial education. </p>

<p>College graduates
preparing to enter the labor force will soon assume a new level of
responsibility for managing their finances. Personal financial management
includes the strategic use of both credit and savings to enhance asset
accumulation and financial well being. Just as the choices that students have
made regarding their education play a vital role in determining career
opportunities, the decisions they make and behaviors they establish regarding
financial management in the coming years will also impact future opportunities
and their ability to capitalize on them. </p>

<p> Compared to a
generation ago, the financial marketplace of today is significantly more
complex. There is now an extensive range of consumer financial products and
services, and providers of these goods and services. Advances in
communications technologies and other technological tools have dramatically
broadened the provision of financial services. For example, the development of
sophisticated credit-scoring models permits lenders to more efficiently
evaluate credit risk and underwrite loans and thus provide a broader array of loans
to more closely meet the specific financial needs of different consumers. In
addition, as workers have become more mobile and more likely to change jobs
several times over the course of their careers, they have increased their
demand for retirement savings vehicles that are portable and have benefits that
are less tied to longevity at a single firm. These developments have increased
the opportunity for consumers to build their asset base through education and
home ownership, exercise greater control over their retirement savings, as well
as acquire at lower cost the goods and services that enhance daily life.</p>

<p> With this increased
access and availability of financial products, consumers also have to assume
greater personal responsibility for managing the use of credit and their
financial outcomes. As I have already noted, in the aggregate, household debt
has grown more rapidly than income in recent years. Of special relevance to
this audience is that the increase in consumer debt loads in recent years is particularly
apparent among younger adults. The majority of this increase is attributable
to student loans, with a 2002 survey by Nellie Mae indicating a 66 percent
increase in the average undergraduate student loan debt from 1997.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>
Credit card debt is another factor contributing to the increased level of debt
among young adults. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data shows that 18-to-24
year olds experienced on average about a 100 percent increase in credit card
debt between 1992 and 2001, albeit from a small base, but still substantially
higher than the rate for other households.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
Moreover, there are indications that some of these younger households are
having difficulty managing their debt successfully. The 2001 SCF indicates
that delinquency rates (one debt payment more than 60 days past due) were twice
as high among households headed by someone less than 35 years old than for
households in the 35-to-44-year age group.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>
Finally, surveys continue to indicate that many workers are not currently
saving for retirement, and many that are saving, by their own calculations, are
not saving enough.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>
</p>

<p>Clearly, these
statistics are sobering and raise some concerns about financial security. In
recognition of the reality of both the promises and pitfalls of the consumer
finance market, there has been a heightened appreciation for consumer
protection. Lawmakers and regulators are mindful of the possibility of abusive
and fraudulent credit practices, commonly known as predatory lending, and have
undertaken efforts to thwart such activity. In addition, employers have
adopted strategies through plan design and education programs to encourage
retirement savings of its workers. But consumers cannot rely solely on the
efforts of others for financial security. They need to develop an
understanding of the available options and be able to comprehend the
implications of their financing and savings decisions. Indeed, lawmakers,
regulators, and employers look to consumer savvy to promote efficiency in the
consumer financial services industry. </p>

<p>In recent years,
surveys and other studies that evaluate the understanding of financial concepts
have demonstrated the need for improved financial education, especially among
younger consumers. One nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing
financial education for youth, the Jump$tart Coalition, has conducted a survey
of financial literacy of high school seniors every two years since 1997.
Overall, the results have been disappointing: Results from the 2004 survey
showed more than 65 percent of students failed the survey's questionnaire, with
only 6 percent scoring a &quot;C&quot; or better. In terms of credit card
usage by college students, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found
that students were more likely than other borrowers to run up debts they could
not pay because of financial inexperience. In recognition of this behavior, many
credit card issuers provided access to financial education materials, and debt
counseling services for students who faced repayment difficulties, but the GAO did
not try to determine the effectiveness of these education efforts.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>
Some preliminary research by others suggests some possible benefits from
online credit education tutorials to college student cardholders, but it is
possible that more responsible usage only reflects the type of student who
would participate in the tutorial.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a>
Clearly, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of consumer education,
and the Federal Reserve System has been an active promoter. In fact, the
System hosted a conference in early April on consumer financial awareness, including
a session on the efficiency of delivering financial education to consumers.</p>

<p>So what resources
are available to consumers to help them become sufficiently familiar with
financial concepts to make sound financial decisions? Many public, private, and
nonprofit organizations have developed a variety of financial education
programs, and many are available on the Internet. These educational materials
address the full range of personal financial management, from the essential
fundamentals of creating a budget and defining specific savings plans to
understanding more complex transactions, such as applying for mortgage credit.
Valuable information on consumer protection matters is also available, concerning
the rights of consumers if a credit or ATM card is stolen or if they are a
victim of identity theft. Similarly, many federal agencies publish a variety
of consumer protection and financial education materials. In fact, the Federal
Reserve System offers a wide variety of consumer information relating to
financial services on its web site. In addition, the Federal Reserve launched a
national personal financial education campaign in 2001 to promote the
importance of financial education, as well as to provide support for the wide
variety of resources committed to this topic.</p>

<p>In addition, in
recognition of the importance of financial education, Congress established the
Financial Literacy and Education Commission in 2003. This Commission, headed
by the Treasury Department, is composed of the heads of twenty federal
agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, to encourage collaboration and
coordination of government and private-sector efforts to promote financial
literacy. The Commission is also charged with establishing a web site and
toll-free number for obtaining financial education resources offered by the
government resources, as well as for developing a national strategy for
promoting financial literacy and education. Under the direction of the
Treasury Department, interagency task forces have worked to streamline access
to the wide variety of consumer information and financial education materials
offered by government agencies. These resources are available on the Internet
at <a href="javascript:exitalert('http://www.mymoney.gov/')">www.mymoney.gov</a>.
Consumers can also call 1-888-MYMONEY to obtain a tool kit of financial
education information that can assist them in understanding credit, savings,
and investment products before they become obligated, and provide a foundation
for shopping for financial products and providers that are most appropriate for
their circumstances and needs. By obtaining a firm grasp of the fundamentals
of financial management, consumers can create savings and spending plans that
are compatible with their earnings throughout their lives and that help them
meet their short- and long-term life goals.</p>

<p>Turning to
retirement savings in particular, workers entering the labor force today will bear
more of the risk of financial security later in life than workers of a
generation ago. Far fewer workers will be covered by defined-benefit pension
plans established by their employers, which provide pre-set benefits after
retirement. Data from the SCF indicate that among workers with a retirement
savings plan, nearly 60 percent of workers aged 25 to 34 were covered by a
defined-benefit plan in 1989; by 2001, this share had declined to 31 percent. Instead
the vast majority of employees with retirement benefits will be offered the
opportunity to contribute to a defined-contribution pension plan, most likely a
401(k) plan, which allows workers to take their retirement assets with them as
they change jobs over the course of their careers. Under a typical 401(k)
plan, retirement wealth will depend primarily on workers' own contributions,
often supplemented with some matching contributions by the employer, returns
realized on the investments chosen, and what workers choose to do with balances
when they change jobs. </p>

<p>However, studies
have found some troubling patterns related to individual savings in 401(k)
plans that suggest that workers may not be giving adequate attention to their retirement
savings. First, despite the tax advantages of 401(k) contributions,
one-quarter of workers eligible for 401(k) plans do not participate at all,
even if the employer would match a portion of their own contributions.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a>
These workers are effectively giving up a pay raise. And among those that
contribute, many save just a little. In a survey last year, one-quarter of
firms reported that their rank-and-file 401(k) participants saved an average of
less than 4 percent of pay.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a>
</p>

<p>Another concern
relates to the way employees manage their 401(k) plans. Some participants
simply invest contributions equally across the investment options or according
to plan defaults, which in many cases is a low-risk, low-return money market
fund.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a>
And, as has been publicized widely in recent years, many 401(k) participants
invest heavily in employer stock. Among companies that offer company stock as
an investment option, more than one-quarter of 401(k) balances are in company
stock.<a href="#fn11" title="footnote 11"><sup>11</sup></a><a name="f11"></a>
This high concentration cannot be attributed entirely to an employer match that
is required to be held in company stock. Instead, employees appear to
voluntarily purchase and hold abundant amounts of company stock, despite the
obvious risk of linking their current income and retirement wealth to the
financial health of their employer. </p>

<p>These patterns are
troubling because they raise doubts about the financial security of workers in
later life. Fortunately, new research in the discipline of behavioral finance
provides some important insights into the behavior of 401(k) participants and
suggests some promising changes that can lead workers to make savings choices
that will leave them better prepared for retirement. Contrary to predictions
of traditional finance theory, the way the retirement-plan options are framed
affects the choices made by participants. Researchers have found that &quot;opt-out&quot;
plans--those that automatically enroll workers unless they actively choose not
to enroll--have substantially higher participation rates than plans in which
employees must take the initiative to opt in.<a href="#fn12" title="footnote 12"><sup>12</sup></a><a name="f12"></a>
Moreover, when defaults are designated, many workers tend to enroll using the
default contribution rates and investment options and to leave these in place
for many years after enrollment, even though the default may be set too low to
allow for the accumulation of sufficient retirement assets.<a href="#fn13" title="footnote 13"><sup>13</sup></a><a name="f13"></a>
</p>

<p>If workers are
influenced by how choices are offered, then employers can make changes to the
plans to help participants make better decisions. For example, employers might
set default contribution rates to rise as workers receive pay raises, or set
the default investment option to a diversified portfolio that adjusts as the
worker ages.<a href="#fn14" title="footnote 14"><sup>14</sup></a><a name="f14"></a>
In addition, employees have increasingly expressed interest in
employer-provided financial education, and firms and lawmakers are responding.
Congress has passed legislation that makes it easier for firms to provide investment
advice with less fear of being held liable should such advice lead to losses.
Some firms have started to provide access to a third-party who will advise
employees about how much to contribute and how to invest their contributions. Moreover,
a recent study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI ) suggests that
education about retirement planning provided by employers led to a substantial
portion of employees altering their retirement savings. </p>

<p>In closing, as credit
availability and financial alternatives continue to expand, it has become ever-more
important for consumers to develop the skills necessary to make informed financial
choices. I encourage prospective graduates to place the same priority and
attention to managing their personal finances as they do to developing their
careers. Beginning early and remaining committed to thoughtful management of
personal finances throughout one's life is an essential element to long-term
financial success.</p>
