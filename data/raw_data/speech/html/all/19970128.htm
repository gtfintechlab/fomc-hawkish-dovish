<P><FONT SIZE="+1">International Competition:  Should We Harmonize
                     Our National Regulatory Systems?</FONT>

<P>
     Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a topic that
has become more important in a world of global financial markets--the matter of
coordinating and harmonizing our national regulatory systems.  On the
conference agenda, the topic was phrased as a question, that is, whether we
<I>should</I> harmonize our systems.  In a sense, the question is somewhat moot--the
globalization of the markets and the breadth of international conglomerate
financial institutions is forcing us in that direction.  But I would quickly add
that one definition of "harmony" is "a pleasing combination of elements."  We
can sing compatible and pleasant-sounding notes, without singing the same note.
It is in that sense that I believe harmonization of our regulatory systems will
develop.
<P>     In my comments this afternoon, I will mention some of the efforts
underway in which the United States is working with other countries to develop
more consistent supervisory and regulatory systems, particularly for large
financial conglomerates.  That experience may provide others with ideas about
how they might pursue similar efforts, either on a bilateral or multilateral basis.
Perhaps more importantly, though, I will also offer my views on where our
interests are likely to be most similar and why and how regulators around the
world are likely to continue working toward compatible or "harmonized"
systems.  Let me begin with those thoughts.
<P>
<B>The Importance of Compatible Regulatory Regimes</B>
<BR>     One cannot have dealt with U.S. and world financial markets during the
past few decades without being thoroughly impressed with the rapid pace of
change and the manner in which technology and financial innovation have
affected market practice.  The improvements in communications and
transportation and, importantly, the gains from technology and the
miniaturization of the goods we produce have fueled a growing volume of
international trade.  Our financial institutions, in turn, have sought constantly to
find more effective and efficient ways to facilitate and finance these activities,
and at the same time manage the related risks.  As a result, we have seen
dramatic growth in financial derivatives, strong support within the industry for
new clearinghouses and netting procedures to reduce counterparty credit risk, a
growing need to clarify our laws and regulations regarding financial contracts,
and financial markets that are far more closely linked today than they were even
a decade ago.

<TABLE WIDTH="600">
<TR>
<TD>     In the area of bank regulation and supervision, substantial progress has
been made in developing capital standards that help to ensure the financial
strength of internationally active banks and that promote greater competition.
Simply put, firms in need of international financial services will utilize domestic
or foreign financial institutions to the extent their prices are competitive and
their financial stability can be assured.  As a result, regulators are recognizing
the need to harmonize laws and regulations in order to promote economic
growth and to deal with important and oftentimes increasingly complex matters
that are of common interest to us all.
<P>     We are recognizing also the need to enhance financial systems--including
supervision and regulation--in the emerging market economies, primarily for the
sake of those economies, themselves, but also because of their increasing
importance in international financial markets.  Indeed, G-7 leaders at their
summit meeting in Lyon last summer identified this goal as an important
element in efforts to promote international financial stability.
<P>     That we need <I>some</I> level of conformity seems, I'm sure, quite clear.
Otherwise, the inconsistency and incompatibility of rules and regulations across
countries may make it difficult, if not impossible, for some firms to engage in
global business activities.  Such barriers are detrimental to the efficiency of
international trade and finance, generally.
<P>     The difficulty, of course, is the precise nature and level of conformity that
is necessary to maintain an efficient and equitable world financial system.  Here
I submit that it may be less important that we standardize <I>particular</I> banking
laws and regulations, than it is for us to pursue similar <I>goals</I>, as we
independently develop our domestic regulation and supervisory structures.
Specifically, if we apply market-based <I>incentives</I> in our regulatory structures,
that, alone, should keep our rules sufficiently similar and compatible.

<TABLE WIDTH="600">
<TR>
<TD>     We must also recognize that technology and financial innovation are
permitting banks today to become ever-more adept at avoiding regulatory
barriers and other restrictions that artificially constrain their activities.
Moreover, to the extent they are effective, such restrictions can work against
local institutions, businesses, or consumers by making banks less competitive
internationally or by withholding from their customers the benefits that
competition can bring.  Regulatory regimes are likely to be more effective in the
long run for financial institutions and for domestic economic growth if they are
market-compatible.
<P>
<B>Areas of Common Interests</B>
<BR>     In our roles as central bankers, bank supervisors, and regulators, what are
the areas of greatest common interest to us for which we should develop
compatible rules and regulations?  To keep it simple, let me suggest two.   First,
to maintain a healthy, responsive, and financially strong banking and financial
system will facilitate the growing needs of our domestic economies.  Second, to
build and maintain an adequate legal and regulatory structure will permit our
institutions to compete safely on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis, both
domestically and abroad.  These thoughts may not sound original; they're not.
They are essentially the two reasons the Basle Committee on Supervision exists,
and they underpin most other international efforts to coordinate banking issues.
<P>     When I consider the past successes in coordinating international bank
supervisory or regulatory policies, I think first of the Bank for International
Settlements and the work of the supervisors' committee.  After all, the BIS has
been the principal forum for developing international supervisory standards for
banks in industrialized countries and, by their voluntary adoption, for banks and
bank supervisors in other countries throughout the world.  Bilateral discussions
can also serve useful functions either where particular issues are of concern or
as a basis for subsequent broader dissemination.
<P>     Nearly a decade ago, such bilateral and--through the BIS--multilateral
efforts produced the risk-based capital standard, known as the Basle Accord.
Since then, we have produced numerous other policy statements dealing with
sound risk management practices for banks.  These statements related first to
derivatives activities and most recently involve the management of interest rate
risk.  Dr. Padoa-Schioppa, chairman of the supervisors' committee, has probably
already discussed these initiatives with you.
<P>     One of the Committee's most recent accomplishments, however, is the
development of new capital standards for market risk in trading activities.  That
standard is notable because it reflects a new approach for constructing
international banking standards.  In particular, the internal models approach
contained within that standard builds on leading industry practices and helps
supervisors to promote risk management in banks.
<P>     Promoting sound risk management is a goal we should all pursue more
aggressively in considering new banking policies and regulations.  It is also the
type of approach I had in mind when I said earlier that our laws and regulations
should be compatible with underlying economics and market demands.  To the
extent we can continue building on "best" or sound banking practices in
designing our rules and regulations, we will be working toward a common end.
As we work together identifying those practices and deciding how to apply them
as supervisory or regulatory standards, we will also be strengthening relations
among ourselves that can prove invaluable in times of market stress.
<P>     Not to over-use the example of the market risk standard, but it illustrates
another useful point, as well.  Reliance on a bank's own risk measurement and
modeling process in determining regulatory capital standards also acknowledges
that no single or specific technique is best for everyone.  Each institution should
tailor its risk measurement and management process to its own needs.  <I>While
adhering to basic principles</I>, each institution must determine for itself the proper
incentives and techniques for managing its affairs.  No two banks or banking
markets are identical in their operations, structure, or historical development.
Permitting a range of compatible responses to similar situations encourages
experimentation, innovation, and growth.  Accommodating a certain level of
flexibility is necessary for banks, and it is necessary for regulators, too.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<A HREF="#pagetop"><IMG SRC="/gifjpg/uparrow.gif" ALT="Return to top" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5"></A><A HREF="#pagetop">Return to top</A><P>
<TABLE WIDTH="600">
<TR>
<TD>     Indeed, flexibility may be even more important for non-G-10 countries
than it is for those of us with large, developed financial systems because of the
greater range of capital market and economic infrastructures among developing
countries.  Materially different situations typically require different solutions.
Accommodating differences, though, does not reduce the need for minimum
regulatory or supervisory standards based upon well-known principles of sound
banking.  It is up to supervisors and, if necessary, legislators to craft regulations
and laws consistent with internationally recognized standards, but
accommodative to local customs and economic needs.
<P>     In developing sufficiently flexible, market-compatible regulations, I
believe we should rely as much as prudently possible on market discipline and
on banks' internal incentives to perform well.  This approach requires that the
public have information about the risk exposures of banks and about their
procedures for managing those risks.  As regulators, we can encourage this
process by requiring or prodding banks to disclose information to the markets
that is both relevant and comparable among institutions.
<P>     Whether such disclosures are imposed by official regulations or evolve
through more subtle efforts, supervisors can help guide the process by
considering carefully the kinds of information the private sector needs and that
banks use--or should use--to manage risk.  Even in the United States, where
surveys show disclosure is relatively good, supervisors make available to the
public data collected on Call Reports.
<P>     In countries where disclosure practices are minimal at best, bank
regulators may be able to perform a particularly important role by publicly
disclosing some, if not much, of the information banks report to them.  By
fueling market information in this way, regulators may stimulate greater investor
interest in banks and the growth of local capital markets.  Improved disclosure
practices by banks may, in turn, also spill over to other industries.  One thing
we know for sure is that investors dislike uncertainty.  By shedding light on a
bank's condition and future prospects, some of that uncertainty should disappear.
<P>     While it is important that key prudential standards be sufficiently robust
and consistent among countries, certain variations in the details and applications
of these standards can be useful.  As with private markets, some level of
competition among regulators can stimulate improvements and change.  I will
grant that the United States may take regulatory competition to an extreme, but
it also demonstrates, I believe, the advantages that derive from accommodating
different views and permitting financial institutions alternative ways to do
business.  In my view, and considering the political difficulties we have faced in
trying to change U.S. banking laws, our current regulatory structure, offering
some choice in charter that is administered by multiple regulators, has provided
financial institutions with more freedom and expanded powers than they would
likely have received with a single regulator.
<P>     Supervisors must be careful, however, as they try new or different
techniques, that they not impair their oversight efforts or relax them beyond
prudent bounds.  In such global markets as we have today, weak or ineffective
supervision in either large or small countries can have far reaching
consequences.  Those concerns were at the heart of early work of the Basle
Committee and its efforts to identify the respective roles and responsibilities of
home and host authorities for internationally active banks.  It is important for
supervisors to be able to rely on their counterparts in other countries to
administer agreed-upon standards of financial institution safety and soundness.
<P>     Whether we conduct our own on-site examinations, rely on external
auditors, or use combinations of other supervisory techniques, we need to assure
ourselves that all banking offices are adequately managed and supervised.  I
would note here that among G-10 countries a more consistent approach may
begin to emerge.  We in the United States are making greater use of the
findings of a bank's internal and external auditors to guide or supplement our
on-site examinations, while some of our counterparts abroad are recognizing
more the benefits of on-site exams.
<P>
<B>Financial Conglomerates</B>
<BR>     Some of the greatest challenges to bank supervisors may arise when
organizations link banking activities with other financial or nonfinancial
businesses.  Such financial conglomerates, which often combine banking,
insurance, and securities activities, are not currently allowed to provide a full
array of financial services in the United States, but they may do so abroad.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<A HREF="#pagetop"><IMG SRC="/gifjpg/uparrow.gif" ALT="Return to top" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5"></A><A HREF="#pagetop">Return to top</A><P>
<TABLE WIDTH="600">
<TR>
<TD>    The existence of such firms--and the fact that some of them are
headquartered in this country--have required regulators and supervisors in the
United States to work with counterparts abroad to discuss oversight
arrangements and develop ways to deal with matters in times of crises.  This
very issue is one of our current challenges.  I have to say that this is not a
particularly quick or easy process and is further complicated by the diverse
regulatory structures, both here and abroad, involving banking, securities, and
sometimes insurance regulators.
<P>     These discussions often raise difficult issues, since they tend to break new
ground in supervision.  For example, what approach should be taken regarding
nonbank--or even nonfinancial--activities of companies that own banks?  In the
context of these conglomerates, what does or should "consolidated supervision"
mean?  Within the context of consolidated supervision, how can the traditional
safety-and-soundness approach used by bank supervisors be reconciled with the
disclosure/self-regulatory approach used by many securities regulators?
Moreover, do the diverse operating structures of conglomerates imply an
extension of the safety net that virtually all governments currently extend to
banks?  One thing is clear:  as we address the challenges of promoting a more
consistent bank supervisory and regulatory process worldwide, we cannot always
take official descriptions of regulatory and oversight regimes at face value.  We
need to dig deeper to understand how laws are interpreted and how individual
banking agencies monitor and enforce safe banking.
<P>     Different countries necessarily have different banking and financial
systems that face unique combinations of exposures and business risks.  Even
within the United States, for example, we have a relatively uniform supervisory
approach for all banks and a risk-based capital standard that applies to them all.
In practice, however, the activities of our banks, their capital levels, and their
operating practices are quite diverse, and our oversight efforts take those
differences into account.  Small banks, themselves, recognize the greater risks
they face from their lack of size and diversity, and have consistently maintained
higher capital ratios than do money center banks.  But they also have less
formal procedures and internal controls, simply because their staffing and
operations are so much smaller.  The point is that even a uniform set of rules
within a given country can and should be implemented differently as conditions
demand.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<BR>     It seems clear that as financial markets become more and more integrated,
bank regulators around the world will be seeing more of each other than they
have in the past.  Even in countries that have no internationally active domestic
banks, authorities need to ensure that the banks operating in their markets are
sound and subject to adequate supervision, whether by home or host authorities.
Banks operating imprudently and without proper supervision are the ones most
likely to mismeasure their risks, misprice their products, and disrupt the markets.
Detecting and deterring such institutions does not require us to have uniform
regulatory or supervisory systems, but it does require a certain level of
cooperation and coordination and a material level of consistency in our
regulatory regimes.  Our experience in the United States suggests that achieving
an appropriate convergence takes time, not only to develop but to maintain.
Progress we have seen through the European Union and the BIS go far in
coordinating, or harmonizing, banking laws, regulations, and operating
standards, but that's just a start.  As managers of large financial institutions
develop more sophisticated and more comprehensive risk management systems,
they are paying less attention every day to the peculiar legal structure of their
organizations.  As regulators, we need to understand how banking organizations
manage and control risks and the full implications of their practices for the
financial safety of depository institutions.  By doing so, we can do much to
protect our own interests while still recognizing and accommodating the
business needs of banks.
<P>     In developing our laws and regulations we need to work together, for
sure.  But perhaps more importantly, we need to understand the market forces
and incentives that banks face.  If we keep those factors in mind in developing
our individual rules, we may go far in developing regulatory systems that are
both compatible among countries and less intrusive to the institutions we
oversee.
