<TR> 
    <TD> <p>One of the more interesting developments in central banking in the past 
        dozen years or so has been the increasingly widespread adoption of the 
        monetary policy framework known as <em>inflation targeting</em>. The approach 
        evolved gradually from earlier monetary policy strategies that followed 
        the demise of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system--most directly, 
        I believe, from the practices of Germany's Bundesbank and the Swiss National 
        Bank during the latter part of the 1970s and the 1980s. For example, the 
        Bundesbank, though it conducted short-term policy with reference to targets 
        for money supply growth, derived those targets each year by calculating 
        the rate of money growth estimated to be consistent with the bank's long-run 
        desired rate of inflation, normally 2 percent per year. Hence, the Bundesbank 
        indirectly targeted inflation, using money growth as a quantitative indicator 
        to aid in the calibration of its policy. Notably, the evidence suggests 
        that, when conflicts arose between its money growth targets and inflation 
        targets, the Bundesbank generally chose to give greater weight to its 
        inflation targets (Bernanke and Mihov, 1997).<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>The inflation-targeting approach became more explicit with the strategies 
        adopted in the early 1990s by a number of pioneering central banks, among 
        them the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of 
        England, Sweden's Riksbank, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Over the 
        past decade, variants of inflation targeting have proliferated, with newly 
        industrialized and emerging-market economies (Brazil, Chile, Israel, Korea, 
        Mexico, South Africa, the Philippines, and Thailand, among others) being 
        among the most enthusiastic initiates. Most recently, this policy framework 
        has also been adopted by several transition economies, notably the Czech 
        Republic, Hungary, and Poland.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a> 
        Central banks that have switched to inflation targeting have generally 
        been pleased with the results they have obtained. The strongest evidence 
        on that score is that, thus far at least, none of the several dozen adopters 
        of inflation targeting has abandoned the approach.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>As an academic interested in monetary policy, several years ago I became 
        intrigued by inflation targeting and went on to co-author a book and several 
        other pieces about this approach.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> 
        As I continue to follow developments in the area, I must say, however, 
        that discussions of inflation targeting in the American media remind me 
        of the way some Americans deal with the metric system--they don't really 
        know what it is, but they think of it as foreign, impenetrable, and possibly 
        slightly subversive. So, in the hope of cutting through some of the fog, 
        today I will offer my own, perhaps somewhat idiosyncratic, view of inflation 
        targeting and its potential benefits, at least in what I consider to be 
        its best-practice form.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a> 
        I will also try to dispel what I feel are a few misconceptions about inflation 
        targeting that have gained some currency. Finally, I will end with a few 
        words, and one modest suggestion, about the implications of the experience 
        with inflation targeting for the practice of monetary policymaking at 
        the Federal Reserve.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a> 
        My main objective today, however, is to clarify, not to advocate. Of course, 
        my comments today reflect my own views and do not necessarily reflect 
        those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal 
        Open Market Committee. </p>
      <p><strong>Best-Practice Inflation Targeting: One View</strong> <br>
        Although inflation targeting has a number of distinguishing features--the 
        announcement of a quantitative target for inflation being the most obvious--capturing 
        the essence of the approach is not entirely straightforward. The central 
        banks that call themselves inflation targeters, as well as the economies 
        they represent, are a diverse group indeed, and (not surprisingly) institutional 
        and operational features differ. Moreover, many central banks that have 
        not formally adopted the framework of inflation targeting have clearly 
        been influenced by the approach (or, if you prefer, the same ideas and 
        trends have influenced both inflation-targeters and non-inflation-targeters). 
        For example, over the past twenty years, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting 
        the inflation-targeting label, has greatly increased its credibility for 
        maintaining low and stable inflation, has become more proactive in heading 
        off inflationary pressures, and has worked hard to improve the transparency 
        of its policymaking process--all hallmarks of the inflation-targeting 
        approach. In short, to draw a bright line between central banks practicing 
        full-fledged inflation targeting and those firmly outside the inflation-targeting 
        camp is more difficult than one might first guess--a fact, by the way, 
        that substantially complicates economists' attempts to assess empirically 
        the effects of this approach. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for expository purposes, I find it useful to break down 
        the inflation targeting approach into two components: (1) a particular 
        framework for making policy choices, and (2) a strategy for communicating 
        the context and rationale of these policy choices to the broader public. 
        Let's call these two components of inflation targeting the policy framework 
        and the communications strategy, for short. </p>
      <p><strong>The policy framework of inflation targeting </strong><br>
        By the <em>policy framework</em> I mean the principles by which the policy 
        committee decides how to set its policy instrument, typically a short-term 
        interest rate. In an earlier speech, I referred to the policy framework 
        that describes what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting 
        as <em>constrained discretion</em>.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a> 
        Constrained discretion attempts to strike a balance between the inflexibility 
        of strict policy rules and the potential lack of discipline and structure 
        inherent in unfettered policymaker discretion. Under constrained discretion, 
        the central bank is free to do its best to stabilize output and employment 
        in the face of short-run disturbances, with the appropriate caution born 
        of our imperfect knowledge of the economy and of the effects of policy 
        (this is the "discretion" part of constrained discretion). However, a 
        crucial proviso is that, in conducting stabilization policy, the central 
        bank must also maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation--and, 
        hence, public expectations of inflation--firmly under control (the "constrained" 
        part of constrained discretion). Because monetary policy influences inflation 
        with a lag, keeping inflation under control may require the central bank 
        to anticipate future movements in inflation and move preemptively. Hence 
        constrained discretion is an inherently forward-looking policy approach. 
      </p>
      <p>Although constrained discretion acknowledges the crucial role that monetary 
        policy plays in stabilizing the real economy, this policy framework does 
        place heavy weight on the proposition that maintenance of low and stable 
        inflation is a key element--perhaps I should say <em>the</em> key element--of 
        successful monetary policy. The rationale for this emphasis goes well 
        beyond the direct benefits of price stability for economic efficiency 
        and growth, important as these are. The maintenance of price stability--and 
        equally important, the development by the central bank of a strong reputation 
        for and commitment to it--also serves to anchor the private sector's expectations 
        of future inflation. Well-anchored inflation expectations (by which I 
        mean that the public continues to expect low and stable inflation even 
        if actual inflation temporarily deviates from its expected level) not 
        only make price stability much easier to achieve in the long term but 
        also increase the central bank's ability to stabilize output and employment 
        in the short run. Short-run stabilization of output and employment is 
        more effective when inflation expectations are well anchored because the 
        central bank need not worry that, for example, a policy easing will lead 
        counterproductively to rising inflation and inflation expectations rather 
        than to stronger real activity. </p>
      <p>In my earlier speech, I gave the Great Inflation of the 1970s in the 
        United States as an example of what can happen when inflation expectations 
        are <em>not</em> well anchored. Contrary to the belief in a long-run tradeoff 
        between inflation and unemployment held by many economists in the 1960s, 
        unemployment and inflation in the 1970s were <em>both</em> high and unstable. 
        Even today conventional wisdom ascribes this unexpected outcome to the 
        oil price shocks of the 1970s. Though increases in oil prices were certainly 
        adverse factors, poor monetary policies in the second half of the 1960s 
        and in the 1970s both facilitated the rise in oil prices themselves and 
        substantially exacerbated their effects on the economy. </p>
      <p>Monetary policy contributed to the oil price increases in the first place 
        by creating an inflationary environment in which excess nominal demand 
        existed for a wide range of goods and services. For example, in an important 
        paper, Barsky and Kilian (2001) noted that the prices of many industrial 
        commodities and raw materials rose in the 1970s about the same time as 
        oil prices, reflecting broad-based inflationary pressures. Without these 
        general inflationary pressures, it is unlikely that the oil producers 
        would have been able to make the large increases in oil prices "stick" 
        for any length of time. </p>
      <p>Besides helping to make the oil price increases possible, the legacy 
        of poor monetary policies also exacerbated the effects of the oil price 
        increases on output and employment. When the oil price shocks hit, beginning 
        in 1973, inflation expectations had already become very unstable, after 
        several years of increased inflationary pressures and a failed program 
        of price controls under President Nixon. Because inflation expectations 
        were no longer anchored, the widely publicized oil price increases were 
        rapidly transmitted into expectations of higher general inflation and, 
        hence, into higher wage demands and other cost pressures. Faced with an 
        unprecedented inflationary surge, the Fed was forced to tighten policy. 
        As it turned out, the Fed's tightening was not enough to contain the inflationary 
        surge but was sufficient to generate a severe recession. </p>
      <p>The upshot is that the deep 1973-75 recession was caused only in part 
        by increases in oil prices <em>per se</em>. An equally important source 
        of the recession was several years of overexpansionary monetary policy 
        that squandered the Fed's credibility regarding inflation, with the ultimate 
        result that the economic impact of the oil producers' actions was significantly 
        larger than it had to be. Instability in both prices and the real economy 
        continued for the rest of the decade, until the Fed under Chairman Paul 
        Volcker re-established the Fed's credibility with the painful disinflationary 
        episode of 1980-82. This latter episode and its enormous costs should 
        also be chalked up to the failure to keep inflation and inflation expectations 
        low and stable. </p>
      <p>In contrast to the 1970s, fluctuations in oil prices have had far smaller 
        effects on both inflation and output in the United States and other industrialized 
        countries since the early 1980s. In part this more moderate effect reflects 
        increased energy efficiency and other structural changes, but I believe 
        the dominant reason is that the use of constrained discretion in the making 
        of monetary policy has led to better anchoring of inflation expectations 
        in the great majority of industrial countries. Because inflation expectations 
        are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do 
        not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy 
        response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago. Indeed, 
        rather than leading to a tightening of monetary policy, increases in oil 
        prices today are more likely to promote consideration of increased policy 
        ease--a direct and important benefit of the improved control of inflation. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>The communications strategy of inflation targeting </strong><br>
        The second major element of best-practice inflation targeting (in my view) 
        is the <em>communications strategy</em>, the central bank's regular procedures 
        for communicating with the political authorities, the financial markets, 
        and the general public. In general, a central bank's communications strategy, 
        closely linked to the idea of <em>transparency</em>, has many aspects 
        and many motivations.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a> 
        Aspects of communication that have been particularly emphasized by inflation-targeting 
        central banks are the public announcement of policy objectives (notably, 
        the objective for inflation), open discussion of the bank's policy framework 
        (including in some cases, but not all, a timeframe for achieving the inflation 
        objective), and public release of the central bank's forecast or evaluation 
        of the economy (as reported, for example, in the <em>Inflation Reports</em> 
        issued by a number of inflation-targeting central banks).<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
      <p>Why have inflation-targeting central banks emphasized communication, 
        particularly the communication of policy objectives, policy framework, 
        and economic forecasts? In the 1960s, many economists were greatly interested 
        in adapting sophisticated mathematical techniques developed by engineers 
        for controlling missiles and rockets to the problem of controlling the 
        economy. At the time, this adaptation of so-called stochastic optimal 
        control methods to economic policymaking seemed natural; for like a ballistic 
        missile, an economy may be viewed as a complicated dynamic system that 
        must be kept on course, despite continuous buffeting by unpredictable 
        forces. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, macroeconomic policy turned out not to be rocket science! 
        The problem lay in a crucial difference between a missile and an economy--which 
        is that, unlike the people who make up an economy, the components of a 
        missile do not try to understand and anticipate the forces being applied 
        to them. Hence, although a given propulsive force always has the same, 
        predictable effect on a ballistic missile, a given policy action--say, 
        a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate--can have very different 
        effects on the economy, depending (for example) on what the private sector 
        infers from that action about likely future policy actions, about the 
        information that may have induced the policymaker to act, about the policymaker's 
        objectives in taking the action, and so on. Thus, taking the "right" policy 
        action--in this case, changing the federal funds rate by the right amount 
        at the right time--is a necessary but not sufficient condition for getting 
        the desired economic response. Most inflation-targeting central banks 
        have found that effective communication policies are a useful way, in 
        effect, to make the private sector a partner in the policymaking process. 
        To the extent that it can explain its general approach, clarify its plans 
        and objectives, and provide its assessment of the likely evolution of 
        the economy, the central bank should be able to reduce uncertainty, focus 
        and stabilize private-sector expectations, and--with intelligence, luck, 
        and persistence--develop public support for its approach to policymaking. 
      </p>
      <p>Of course, as has often been pointed out, actions speak louder than words; 
        and declarations by the central bank will have modest and diminishing 
        value if they are not clear, coherent, and--most important--credible, 
        in the sense of being consistently backed up by action. But agreeing that 
        words must be consistently backed by actions is not the same as saying 
        that words have no value. In the extreme, I suppose a central bank could 
        run a "Marcel Marceau" monetary policy, allowing its actions to convey 
        all its intended meaning. But common sense suggests that the best option 
        is to combine actions with words--to take clear, purposeful, and appropriately 
        timed policy actions that are supported by coherent explanation and helpful 
        guidance about the future. </p>
      <p>One objection that has been raised to the public announcement of policy 
        objectives, economic forecasts, and (implicit or explicit) policy plans 
        by central banks is that even relatively modest commitments along these 
        lines may limit their flexibility to choose the best policies in the future. 
        Isn't it always better to be more rather than less flexible? Shouldn't 
        the considered judgment of experienced policymakers always trump rules, 
        even relatively flexible ones, for setting policy? </p>
      <p>I agree that human judgment should always be the ultimate source of policy 
        decisions and that no central bank should--or is even able to--commit 
        irrevocably in advance to actions that may turn out to be highly undesirable. 
        However, the intuition that more flexibility is always better than less 
        flexibility is quite fallacious, a point understood long ago by Homer, 
        who told of how Ulysses had himself tied to the mast so as not to fall 
        victim to the songs of the Sirens. More recently, the notion that more 
        flexibility is always preferable has been pretty well gutted by modern 
        game theory (not to mention modern monetary economics), which has shown 
        in many contexts that the ability to commit in advance often yields better 
        outcomes. </p>
      <p>For illustration of the potential benefits to policymakers of even modest 
        self-imposed restrictions on flexibility, consider fiscal policy, which 
        shares with monetary policy some of the same issues that arise when a 
        group of shifting membership makes a series of policy decisions that have 
        both short-run and long-run implications. In the short run, fiscal policymakers 
        may have important and legitimate reasons to depart from budget balance, 
        sometimes even substantially--for example, to appropriate funds to deal 
        with a national emergency or to provide a stimulus package to assist economic 
        recovery. In the long run, however, maintaining public confidence requires 
        that fiscal policy be conducted in such a way that the ratio of national 
        debt to GDP remains stable at a moderate level. Arguably, public confidence, 
        and hence the ability of policymakers to use fiscal instruments aggressively 
        to address short-term concerns, is enhanced by whatever legislative rules, 
        guidelines, or procedures exist that--however gently or firmly--tend to 
        compel the policymakers to bring the budget back toward balance, and the 
        debt-GDP ratio back toward stability, after the crisis has passed. True, 
        spending caps, comprehensive budget resolutions, mandatory long-term deficit 
        projections, and similar provisions, to the extent that they are effective, 
        may reduce at least a bit the flexibility of fiscal policymakers. But 
        if intentionally yielding a bit of flexibility increases public confidence 
        in the long-run sustainability of the government's spending and tax plans, 
        fiscal policymakers may find that adopting these rules actually enhances 
        their ability to act effectively in the short run. </p>
      <p>As with fiscal policy, public beliefs about how monetary policy will 
        perform in the long run affect the effectiveness of monetary policy in 
        the short run. Suppose, for example, that the central bank wants to stimulate 
        a weak economy by cutting its policy interest rate. The effect on real 
        activity will be strongest if the public is confident in the central bank's 
        unshakable commitment to price stability, as that confidence will moderate 
        any tendency of wages, prices, or long-term interest rates to rise today 
        in anticipation of possible future inflationary pressures generated by 
        the current easing of policy. Now the central bank's reputation and credibility 
        may be entirely sufficient that no additional framework or guidelines 
        are needed. Certainly, in general, the greater the inherited credibility 
        of the central bank, the less restrictive need be the guidelines, targets, 
        or the like that form the central bank's communication strategy. But credibility 
        is not a permanent characteristic of a central bank; it must be continuously 
        earned. Moreover, an explicit policy framework has broader advantages, 
        including among others increased buy-in by politicians and the public, 
        increased accountability, reduced uncertainty, and greater intellectual 
        clarity. Hence, though a central bank with strong credibility may wish 
        to adopt a relatively loose and indicative set of guidelines for communication 
        with the public, even such a bank may benefit from increasing its communication 
        with the public and adding a bit of structure to its approach to making 
        policy. From the public's perspective, the central bank's commitment to 
        a policy framework, including a long-run inflation target, imposes the 
        same kind of discipline and accountability on the central bank that a 
        long-term commitment to fiscal stability places on the fiscal authorities. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting</strong><br>
        I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions 
        about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public 
        debate. </p>
      <p><em>Misconception #1: Inflation targeting involves mechanical, rule-like 
        policymaking.</em> As Rick Mishkin and I emphasized in our early expository 
        article (Bernanke and Mishkin, 1997), inflation targeting is a policy 
        <em>framework</em>, not a rule. If it is to be coherent and purposeful, 
        <em>all</em> policy is made within some sort of conceptual framework; 
        the question is the degree to which the framework is explicit. Inflation 
        targeting provides one particular coherent framework for thinking about 
        monetary policy choices which, importantly, lets the public in on the 
        conversation. If this framework succeeds in its goals of anchoring inflation 
        expectations, it may also make the policymaker's ultimate task easier. 
        But making monetary policy under inflation targeting requires as much 
        insight and judgment as under any policy framework; indeed, inflation 
        targeting can be particularly demanding in that it requires policymakers 
        to give careful, fact-based, and analytical explanations of their actions 
        to the public. </p>
      <p><em>Misconception #2: Inflation targeting focuses exclusively on control 
        of inflation and ignores output and employment objectives. </em>Several 
        authors have made the distinction between so-called "strict" inflation 
        targeting, in which the only objective of the central bank is price stability, 
        and "flexible" inflation targeting, which allows attention to output and 
        employment as well. In the early days of inflation targeting, this distinction 
        may have been a useful one, as a number of inflation-targeting central 
        banks talked the language of strict inflation targeting and one or two 
        came close to actually practicing it. For quite a few years now, however, 
        strict inflation targeting has been without significant practical relevance. 
        In particular, I am not aware of <em>any</em> real-world central bank 
        (the language of its mandate notwithstanding) that does not treat the 
        stabilization of employment and output as an important policy objective. 
        To use the wonderful phrase coined by Mervyn King, the Governor-designate 
        of the inflation-targeting Bank of England, there are no "inflation nutters" 
        heading major central banks.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a> 
        Moreover, virtually all (I am tempted to say "all") recent research on 
        inflation targeting takes for granted that stabilization of output and 
        employment is an important policy objective of the central bank. In short, 
        in both theory and practice, today all inflation targeting is of the flexible 
        variety.<a href="#fn11" title="footnote 11"><sup>11</sup></a><a name="f11"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>A second, more serious, issue is the relative weight, or ranking, of 
        inflation and unemployment (or, more precisely, the output gap) among 
        the central bank's objectives. Countries differ in this regard, both in 
        formal mandate and in actual practice.<a href="#fn12" title="footnote 12"><sup>12</sup></a><a name="f12"></a> 
        As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach 
        of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social 
        weights on inflation and unemployment; the approach can be applied equally 
        well by "inflation hawks," "growth hawks," and anyone in between. What 
        I find particularly appealing about constrained discretion, which is the 
        heart of the inflation-targeting approach, is the possibility of using 
        it to get better results in terms of <em>both</em> inflation and employment. 
        Personally, I subscribe unreservedly to the Humphrey-Hawkins dual mandate, 
        and I would not be interested in the inflation-targeting approach if I 
        didn't think it was the best available technology for achieving both sets 
        of policy objectives.<a href="#fn13" title="footnote 13"><sup>13</sup></a><a name="f13"></a> 
      </p>
      <p><em>Misconception #3: Inflation targeting is inconsistent with the central 
        bank's obligation to maintain financial stability.</em> Let me address 
        this point in the context of the United States. The most important single 
        reason for the founding of the Federal Reserve was the desire of the Congress 
        to increase the stability of American financial markets, and the Fed continues 
        to regard ensuring financial stability as a critical responsibility. (By 
        the way, this is a reason to be nervous about the recent trend of separating 
        central banking and financial supervision; I hope we have the sense not 
        to do that here.) I have always taken it to be a bedrock principle that 
        when the stability or very functioning of financial markets is threatened, 
        as during the October 1987 stock market crash or the September 11 terrorist 
        attacks, that the Federal Reserve would take a leadership role in protecting 
        the integrity of the system. I see no conflict between that role and inflation 
        targeting (indeed, inflation targeting seems to require the preservation 
        of financial stability as part of preserving macroeconomic stability), 
        and I have never heard a proponent of inflation targeting argue otherwise.<a href="#fn14" title="footnote 14"><sup>14</sup></a><a name="f14"></a> 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Inflation Targeting and the Federal Reserve </strong><br>
        As I noted earlier, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting any explicit 
        affiliation with inflation targeting, has been influenced by many of the 
        same ideas that have influenced self-described inflation targeters. Increasingly 
        greater transparency and more forward-looking, proactive policy are two 
        examples of convergence in practice between the Fed and inflation-targeting 
        central banks, and I think most would agree that both of these developments 
        have been positive and have led to better outcomes. Most important, however, 
        as I discussed in the earlier speech, under Chairman Volcker and Chairman 
        Greenspan, the Fed has moved gradually toward a policy framework of constrained 
        discretion.<a href="#fn15" title="footnote 15"><sup>15</sup></a><a name="f15"></a> 
        In particular, through two decades of effort the Fed has restored its 
        credibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, which--as theory 
        suggests--has had the important benefit of increasing the institution's 
        ability to respond to shocks to the real economy. The acid test occurred 
        in 2001, when the FOMC cut interest rates by nearly 500 basis points without 
        any apparent adverse effect on inflation expectations. </p>
      <p>Given the Fed's strong performance in recent years, would there be any 
        gains in moving further down the road toward inflation targeting? The 
        most heated debates are said to occur on questions that are inherently 
        impossible to prove either way, and I am afraid that this question gives 
        rise to one of those debates, involving as it does counterfactual futures. 
        Personally, though, I believe that U.S. monetary policy would be better 
        in the long run if the Fed chose to make its policy framework somewhat 
        more explicit. First, the Fed is currently in a good and historically 
        rare situation, having built a consensus both inside and outside the Fed 
        for good policies. We would be smart to try to lock in this consensus 
        a bit more by making our current procedures more explicit and less mysterious 
        to the public. Second, making the Fed's inflation goals and its medium-term 
        projections for the economy more explicit would reduce uncertainty and 
        assist planning in financial markets and in the economy more generally. 
        Finally, any additional anchoring of inflation expectations that we can 
        achieve now will only be helpful in the future.</p>
      <p> To move substantially further in the direction of inflation targeting, 
        should it choose to do so, the Fed would have to take two principal steps: 
        first, to quantify (numerically, and in terms of a specific price index) 
        what the Federal Open Market Committee means by "price stability", and 
        second, to publish regular medium-term projections or forecasts of the 
        economic outlook, analogous to the <em>Inflation Reports</em> published 
        by both inflation-targeting central banks. </p>
      <p>Particularly now that we are in the general range of price stability, 
        I believe that quantifying what the FOMC means by price stability would 
        provide useful information to the public and lend additional clarity to 
        the policymaking process. Let me add a caveat however. Despite the potential 
        long-run benefits of such a change, FOMC members may be concerned at this 
        juncture that the Congress and the public would misperceive the quantification 
        of price stability as an elevation of the Fed's price stability objective 
        above its employment objective in violation of the dual mandate, even 
        if that were in no way the intention. Although personally I have no doubt 
        that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent 
        with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of 
        communication raised by such a change. Realistically, this step is unlikely 
        to occur without a good bit more public discussion. I hope that my talk 
        today contributes to that discussion.<a href="#fn16" title="footnote 16"><sup>16</sup></a><a name="f16"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>The publication of medium-term forecasts does not raise nearly the same 
        difficult political and communication issues that quantification of price 
        stability may, in my view, and so I propose it here as a more feasible 
        short-term step. The FOMC already releases (and has released since 1979) 
        a range and a "central tendency" of its projections for nominal GDP growth, 
        real GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the civilian unemployment rate twice 
        each year, publishing them as part of the semiannual <em>Monetary Policy 
        Report to the Congress</em>.<a href="#fn17" title="footnote 17"><sup>17</sup></a><a name="f17"></a> 
        These projections are actually quite interesting, as they represent the 
        views of Fed policymakers of the future evolution of the economy, conditional 
        on what each policymaker views as the best path for future policy. Two 
        drawbacks of these projections as they now stand are that (1) they are 
        sometimes not released for a number of weeks (the time between the FOMC 
        meeting at which they are assembled and the Chairman's testimony to the 
        Congress), and (2) the January projections cover only the remainder of 
        the current year (the July projections cover the remainder of the current 
        year and all of the subsequent year). </p>
      <p>I think it would be very useful to detach these projections from the 
        Monetary Policy Report and instead release them shortly after the meetings 
        (in January and July) at which they are compiled. I would also suggest 
        adding a second year of forecast to the January projection, to make it 
        more parallel to the July projection as well as to the forecasts in the 
        staff-prepared Greenbook. By releasing the projections in a more timely 
        manner, and by adding a year to the January projection, the FOMC could 
        provide quite useful information to the public. In particular, the FOMC 
        projections would convey the policymakers' sense of the medium-term evolution 
        of the economy, providing insight into both the Fed's diagnosis of economic 
        conditions and its policy objectives.<a href="#fn18" title="footnote 18"><sup>18</sup></a><a name="f18"></a> 
        Ideally, the release of these projections also would provide occasions 
        for Governors and regional Bank Presidents, drawing on the expertise of 
        their respective staffs, to convey their individual views on the prospects 
        for the economy and the objectives of monetary policy. </p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion </strong><br>
        Inflation targeting, at least in its best-practice form, consists of two 
        parts: a policy framework of constrained discretion and a communication 
        strategy that attempts to focus expectations and explain the policy framework 
        to the public. Together, these two elements promote both price stability 
        and well-anchored inflation expectations; the latter in turn facilitates 
        more effective stabilization of output and employment. Thus, a well-conceived 
        and well-executed strategy of inflation targeting can deliver good results 
        with respect to output and employment as well as inflation. </p>
      <p>Although communication plays several important roles in inflation targeting, 
        perhaps the most important is focusing and anchoring expectations. Clearly 
        there are limits to what talk can achieve; ultimately, talk must be backed 
        up by action, in the form of successful policies. Likewise, for a successful 
        and credible central bank like the Federal Reserve, the immediate benefits 
        of adopting a more explicit communication strategy may be modest. Nevertheless, 
        making the investment now in greater transparency about the central bank's 
        objectives, plans, and assessments of the economy could pay increasing 
        dividends in the future.</p>

        targeter is not universally accepted. Certainly, the Bundesbank did not 
        put the same emphasis on communication and transparency that modern inflation-targeting

        the transition to European monetary union are a partial exception. The 
        European Central Bank itself has an inflation objective (a ceiling of 
        2 percent) but does not refer to itself as an inflation-targeting central 
        bank, largely on the grounds that (officially, at least) it also puts 
        some weight on money growth in its policy decisions. As a newly created 
        central bank presiding over a monetary union, the ECB is unique in more 
        fundamental ways as well; hence, the lessons from the ECB experience for 
        the Federal Reserve and other established central banks may be somewhat 
        limited. <a href="#f3">Return to text</a>

        than as rules because they simply make public the elements of the policy 
        framework, that is, constrained discretion. Even when the inflation target 
        itself is set outside the central bank or by an outside agency with the 
        cooperation of the central bank, for the most part inflation-targeting 
        central banks themselves rather than outsiders (such as the legislature) 
        are the principal enforcers of their own targets and procedures. &#8220;Self-enforced&#8221;

        refer to inflation stabilization as the central bank&#8217;s &#8220;primary 
        long-run objective.&#8221; At one level, this statement does not have 
        much content because inflation is the only variable that central banks 
        can control in the long run. Its real import is to say that the central 
        bank is responsible for long-run price stability, a statement that should 
        be unobjectionable in any framework. <a href="#f12">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn13"></a>13. Meyer (2001) draws a distinction between a hierarchical 
        mandate, which subordinates other objectives to the price stability objective, 
        and a dual mandate, which places price stability and employment objectives 
        on equal footing. Like Meyer, I prefer the dual mandate formulation and 
        find it to be fully consistent with inflation targeting. Formally, the 
        dual mandate can be represented by a central bank loss function that includes 
        both inflation and unemployment (or the output gap) symmetrically. <a href="#f13">Return

        a commenter on a paper about inflation targeting and asset prices that 
        Mark Gertler and I presented at the Fed&#8217;s Jackson Hole conference 
        in August 1999, as published in the conference volume: &#8220;I want to 
        correct the impression . . . that Mark and I are somehow against lender-of-last-resort 
        activities, which is absolutely wrong. I have studied the Depression quite 
        a bit in my career, and I think there are two distinguishing mistakes 
        that the Federal Reserve made. The first was to allow a serious deflation, 
        which an inflation targeting regime would not have permitted. And the 
        second was to allow the financial system to collapse, and I absolutely 
        agree with, for example, what happened in October 1987 and other interventions 
        . . . One advantage of the inflation targeting approach as opposed, for 
        example, to a currency board, is [that] it gives you considerably more 
        scope for lender-of-last-resort activities.&#8221; (Federal Reserve Bank

        its estimate of the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy, for 
        symmetry with its estimate of price stability. Unfortunately, potential 
        output growth tends to be variable and difficult to measure with precision. 
        A deeper asymmetry arises from the fact that, unlike the long-run rate 
        of inflation, the Federal Reserve cannot control, and thus cannot be held 
        responsible for, the long-run economic growth rate. <a href="#f16">Return

        forecasts). I think that option is worth considering but prefer focusing 
        on the FOMC projections for now. The projections of the FOMC members draw 
        heavily on the expertise of the Board staff, as well as the staff of the 
        regional Banks, but they also reflect the policymakers&#8217; personal 
        views, which I think is important. Reporting policymakers&#8217; projections 
        rather than staff projections is in keeping with the practices of most 
        other central banks. <a href="#f18">Return to text</a>
