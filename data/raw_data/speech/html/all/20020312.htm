    <TD> 
      <p>Thank you for inviting me to your conference. The financial services 
        industry--the insured depository sector in particular--has been accorded 
        two unique responsibilities: It is the repository of the payment transfer 
        system and the conduit for deposit insurance. Along with these valuable 
        benefits, and because of the unique role they confer, your segment of 
        the industry receives a high degree of legislative and regulatory oversight. 
      </p>
      <p>Also, your regulatory and legislative environment changes continuously 
        as market forces and economic conditions evolve. Those of you who take 
        time away from your financial institutions and your families to help formulate 
        your industry's position on governmental issues do both your industry 
        and your country a service, and I salute you.</p>
      <p>Today I will provide a brief overview of community banking's economic 
        health, review some recent regulatory changes, remind you of some issues 
        currently on your legislative plate, and close with observations on what 
        might be on the horizon.</p>
      <p><b>Financial Condition of Community Institutions</b><br>
        The past year was interesting and challenging for many U.S. banks and 
        thrift institutions. Economic weakness led to a steady decline in market 
        interest rates, further deterioration in asset quality, and for many institutions, 
        a year of slower growth in earnings or even losses.</p>
      <p>Although the macroenvironment most heavily affected large regional and 
        money-center banks, strains are also showing at smaller institutions. 
        As a group, commercial institutions with assets of less than $1 billion--a 
        common definition of &quot;community banks&quot;--reported smaller net 
        interest margins for the year and weaker asset quality. Reserve coverage 
        of nonperforming loans also declined, to less than 1.5 times problem loans 
        compared with 1.7 for 2000. The number of problem smaller institutions 
        has increased, and the costs of several recent bank failures raise the 
        specter of a return to significant insurance premiums.</p>
      <p>It is clear, however, that U.S. depository institutions, including commercial 
        banks and stock and mutual thrifts, remain sound, with still historically 
        strong profitability, capital ratios, and loan portfolios. Without becoming 
        complacent, the industry can take comfort, so far, that it has withstood 
        the recent economic weakness quite well. Importantly, the financial performance 
        of community institutions over this past year reaffirms that the historic 
        business model still works. Depository institutions can attract and maintain 
        core deposits and find lending opportunities that generate a manageable 
        spread. A combination of non-interest income generation and efficient 
        management produce both return-on-asset and return-on-equity ratios that, 
        for community banks, are consistent with historic norms. Continued growth 
        in the number of de novo banks and branch offices also suggests that the 
        outlook for community banks remains bright. The number of small banks 
        continues to shrink, but, as with larger banks, this decline seems to 
        reflect consolidation, not weaknesses in your charter. Your management 
        challenges in the future, however, will not, in my view, be easy.</p>
      <p>As a Fed governor, I should not miss the opportunity to sound a cautionary 
        note to bankers. While clearly divorcing the following point from any 
        suggestion about the future direction of monetary policy, I note that 
        interest rates are historically low and that the effective maturity of 
        many banking assets has increased. During the fourth quarter of last year, 
        in particular, the industry enjoyed a large inflow of low-cost core deposits. 
        These funds helped boost earnings and net interest margins throughout 
        the industry. They may also, however, prove difficult to retain when market 
        conditions improve and depositors leave the safety of insured deposit 
        instruments for the potential higher yields of equities.</p>
      <p>Lending and deposit-taking have long been the life-blood of community 
        institutions, yet certain long-term trends may give cause for concern. 
        For the past decade, for example, the share of banking assets funded by 
        core deposits has steadily declined. Ignoring the performance of last 
        quarter, fewer and fewer funds are being made available to banks at such 
        low cost. The evidence clearly indicates that community banks have been 
        as successful--if not more so--than the larger, even the largest, banks 
        in obtaining non-insured deposits, but this success has entailed an increase 
        in their deposit costs. </p>
      <p>If, as recent economic studies suggest, economies of scale are more important 
        in banking than previously thought, they will lead to continuing pressures 
        on small banks. Studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s found that 
        economies of scale were initially achieved by the largest institutions 
        where size and technological sophistication could lead to greater efficiencies. 
        This evidence is consistent with the increasing competitive pressure that 
        community bankers feel and their growing need to adopt some of the larger 
        banks' procedures while keeping the community touch that larger banks 
        seem unable to replicate. Increasingly, the tradeoff between the relatively 
        high-tech, market-pricing strategy of the largest institutions and the 
        high-touch, personalized service of smaller institutions has become apparent.</p>
      <p>Let's turn now to some recent regulatory actions of interest to community 
        bankers.</p>
      <p><b>Regulatory Developments in Consumer Financial Services</b><br>
        In the past few months, the Board has significantly revised two consumer 
        financial services regulations. The new rules are designed to help ensure 
        fair treatment of consumers seeking and obtaining mortgage credit. Regulation 
        C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), was revised 
        after a comprehensive review to update the regulation. Regulation Z, which 
        implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), was revised to address continuing 
        concerns about abusive mortgage-lending practices. The Board adopted final 
        rules after taking into account the views of interested parties and weighing 
        the costs and benefits of different regulatory approaches.</p>
      <p><b><i>Revisions to Regulation C (HMDA) </i></b><br>
        The recent amendments to Regulation C represent the Board's first comprehensive 
        review of the regulation for more than a decade. During that period, the 
        home mortgage market has changed in many ways. For instance, subprime 
        lending has grown substantially. Prequalification of consumers for home-purchase 
        loans is becoming more commonplace. Lenders have moved to risk-based pricing, 
        and thus fair-lending analysis has shifted from a primary focus on loan 
        denials to scrutiny of loan pricing, particularly of higher-priced loans. 
        The amendments published last month are intended to improve the consistency 
        and the quality of data collected on home mortgage loans. In a changing 
        market, such consistency and quality will help ensure the continued utility 
        of the data. Among other things, the amendments expand the number of nondepository 
        institutions subject to HMDA's reporting requirements, define applications 
        to include certain programs in which applicants are &quot;preapproved&quot; 
        for credit, and revise the definitions of reportable loans generally. 
        These changes are intended to obtain more complete and consistent data 
        about a financial institution's home mortgage lending. Most significantly, 
        the amendments require the collection, through the reporting of a rate 
        spread, of pricing data on loans for which the credit risks are generally 
        higher than they are for prime loans. </p>
      <p>Please note that we are requesting public comment on a few open issues. 
        We have suggested the reporting of loans with a spread of 3 percentage 
        points above a Treasury security with a comparable maturity for first-lien 
        loans, and 5 percentage points for subordinate-lien loans (which generally 
        have a higher annual percentage rate). As a result, approximately 10 percent 
        of all first-lien mortgage loans and 22 percent of all subordinate-lien 
        loans would be covered under the reporting rules. We are soliciting comments 
        on whether these cut-offs are in fact the appropriate ones to capture 
        loans for which the credit risk, in most cases, is greater than that for 
        prime loans. We are also soliciting comments on whether lien status should 
        be reported and whether information about race and ethnicity should be 
        requested in connection with telephone applications. Our intention is 
        to take final action on the cutoffs and other proposals by midyear 2002. 
        The data collection under the new rules begins in January 2003.</p>
      <p><b><i>Revisions to Regulation Z (TILA)</i></b><br>
        In December, the Board revised Regulation Z. As you know, the Home Ownership 
        and Equity Protection Act--commonly referred to as HOEPA--amended the 
        Truth in Lending Act in 1994 to address predatory mortgage-lending practices. 
        The December amendments to Regulation Z were a response to continued concern 
        about predatory lending. </p>
      <p>The increase in subprime lending has been accompanied by an increase 
        in reports of predatory lending, particularly in connection with higher-cost 
        subprime loans, for which price variations can be significant and through 
        which borrowers may be more vulnerable to abuse. In the past year or so, 
        the Board has been concerned--as have members of the Congress, consumer 
        advocates, federal and state regulators, and others--about the effect 
        of predatory lending on certain borrowers and neighborhoods. In some instances, 
        borrowers who are &quot;house-rich and cash-poor&quot; fall prey to predatory 
        lenders. </p>
      <p>In exercising its authority under HOEPA to address abusive and unfair 
        lending practices, the Board has sought to adopt rules that are narrowly 
        tailored to specific problems without unduly restricting legitimate subprime 
        lending. This task is difficult and has certain tradeoffs. To some extent, 
        regulations designed to deter predatory lending may unavoidably affect 
        legitimate creditors and may limit consumer choice. Still, I believe that 
        the rules issued by the Board are a measured response and they will help 
        homeowners avoid falling victim to predatory practices without impeding 
        their access to legitimate subprime lending. </p>
      <p>Though the new HOEPA rules may deter certain predatory lending activity, 
        we should be mindful that regulation alone will not eliminate predatory 
        lending. Unscrupulous lenders may ignore the rules or find ways to avoid 
        them. To be effective, attacks on predatory lending must be carried out 
        on a broad front, including reforms to simplify the mortgage-lending process 
        and better enforcement of existing laws. </p>
      <p>Industry self-regulation and self-policing would also be beneficial. 
        The revised HOEPA rules and other efforts will, we hope, send a signal 
        to the marketplace that institutions should establish policies and procedures 
        to avoid predatory lending practices, review their loan products and underwriter 
        incentives, and reassess their relationships with brokers and other third 
        parties. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, improvements in financial 
        literacy are critical.</p>
      <p><b><i>The Importance of Financial Literacy</i></b> <br>
        The importance of financial literacy has been a recurring theme throughout 
        the numerous discussions among regulators, lawmakers, lenders, and consumer 
        advocates on how to thwart predatory lending. Knowledgeable consumers--those 
        who know their options and understand their rights--are one of the greatest 
        defenses against unscrupulous creditors. In recognition of this, various 
        interested parties have undertaken comprehensive campaigns to increase 
        consumer awareness of the marketing tactics and lending practices of these 
        creditors.</p>
      <p>The Congress recently held hearings on financial literacy, at which the 
        Federal Reserve Board Chairman offered his perspectives on the importance 
        of education to equip consumers--especially those who have been traditionally 
        underserved by our financial system--with the information they need to 
        participate in an ever-increasingly complex financial services marketplace. 
        We are seeing a broad range of organizations, including government agencies, 
        secondary market participants, and community organizations, undertaking 
        financial literacy initiatives. Toward this end, the Federal Reserve System 
        has made a commitment to financial literacy and has developed several 
        initiatives to increase it. Some of the Federal Reserve Banks have web-based 
        resources linking consumers to information on various financial topics, 
        including the responsible use of credit cards, wealth-building strategies, 
        saving and budgeting, and debt management. I understand that America's 
        Community Bankers is launching a financial literacy campaign, and I applaud 
        your interest in consumers' financial education. </p>
      <p><b>Future Regulatory Actions</b><br>
        Let me now mention two regulatory matters on the horizon. One involves 
        the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA); the other involves the Equal Credit 
        Opportunity Act.</p>
      <p> <i><b>Interagency Review of Community Reinvestment Act Regulations (The 
        Board's Regulation BB)</b></i><br>
        The banking agencies revised the CRA regulations in 1995 to develop a 
        system that focused on objective, performance-based assessment standards. 
        At that time, we made a commitment to review the effectiveness of the 
        revised regulations in 2002. Last July, the agencies issued an advance 
        notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the CRA regulations. We solicited 
        comments on several issues, including the general question of whether 
        any changes to the regulations are warranted. We also asked whether the 
        regulations strike the appropriate balance between quantitative and qualitative 
        measures and among the tests for lending, investment, and service.</p>
      <p>Together the agencies received approximately 400 comments. I know that 
        your organization has raised concerns about the investment test and would 
        like to see the asset-size standard for what constitutes a small bank 
        increased significantly. Many small and medium-sized institutions share 
        your concerns about the current threshold. As you can imagine, most community 
        groups take the opposite view. They do not want the number of small institutions 
        covered by the streamlined evaluations increased, and they want to keep 
        a required, freestanding investment test for large retail banks. Finding 
        the right formulation for these and other issues will be our big challenge.</p>
      <p>The agencies are now analyzing the comment letters received on the advance 
        notice and are committed to making any necessary revisions to the CRA 
        regulations as soon as possible. </p>
      <p><b><i>Review of Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) </i></b><br>
        In August 1999, after a comprehensive review of Regulation B, which<br>
        implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Board issued a proposed 
        rule. No further action was taken.</p>
      <p>Among other things, the proposal calls for eliminating the prohibition 
        on a<br>
        creditor's collection of data about borrower characteristics, such as 
        race and ethnicity, in connection with nonmortgage loans. This aspect 
        of the proposal elicited strong reactions, both positive and negative. 
        The Board plans to consider further actions on this matter sometime in 
        2002.</p>
      <p><b>Industry Safety and Soundness</b><br>
        Finally, let me share some thoughts about industry safety and soundness. 
        As everyone in the room understands, we have recently experienced a decade 
        of economic prosperity followed by more than a year of weak economic conditions. 
        For the past few months we have seen clear indication that economic conditions 
        are improving and we are either at or near the end of the down cycle.</p>
      <p>Because loan losses tend to be lagging indicators, this is the time that 
        weaknesses in credit quality tend to emerge. I see reason for both optimism 
        and concern. On the one hand, financial institutions seem to have learned 
        from the severe credit conditions of the late 1980s and early 1990s. More-thorough 
        credit administration, greater reliance on credit-scoring models, and 
        real-time access to public records and credit data have allowed lenders 
        to carefully screen and monitor credit applications, approvals, and loan 
        performance. These improved techniques combined with a much shallower 
        recession than seen in other economic cycles are all encouraging signs.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, because we had ten years of unbroken prosperity, we 
        have a new generation of lending officers whose experience has not yet 
        been tempered by troubled economic times. Additionally, many of the new 
        credit-scoring models have been developed and refined only during prosperity. 
        Finally, new financial instruments that have allowed financial institutions 
        to mitigate risk exposure have had the unintended consequence of creating 
        new strains on internal controls. Additionally, institutions responding 
        to market pressures for strong earnings performance are susceptible to 
        aggressive and at times misleading accounting treatment. </p>
      <p>On a related issue, recent public scrutiny of very high profile meltdowns 
        has raised new concerns. While accounting, disclosure, regulatory oversight, 
        and the role of market analysts will all attract new scrutiny, the primary 
        responsibility will continue to rest where it has always been--on the 
        shoulders of senior management. This organization represents the survivors 
        of perhaps the most debilitating financial crisis of the second half of 
        the twentieth century--the thrift industry crisis of the late 1980s and 
        early 1990s. This group does not need advice on how to survive tough times. 
        You have done it before, and though today's challenges are new, your previously 
        demonstrated resilience gives reason for confidence that you can do it 
        again.<br>
