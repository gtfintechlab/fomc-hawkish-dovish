 <p>Although the gold standard could hardly be portrayed as having produced a 
        period of price tranquility, it was the case that the price level in 1929 
        was not much different, on net, from what it had been in 1800. But, in 
        the two decades following the abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, 
        the consumer price index in the United States nearly doubled. And, in 
        the four decades after that, prices quintupled. Monetary policy, unleashed 
        from the constraint of domestic gold convertibility, had allowed a persistent 
        overissuance of money. As recently as a decade ago, central bankers, having 
        witnessed more than a half-century of chronic inflation, appeared to confirm 
        that a fiat currency was inherently subject to excess. </p>
      <p>But the adverse consequences of excessive money growth for financial 
        stability and economic performance provoked a backlash. Central banks 
        were finally pressed to rein in overissuance of money even at the cost 
        of considerable temporary economic disruption. By 1979, the need for drastic 
        measures had become painfully evident in the United States. The Federal 
        Reserve, under the leadership of Paul Volcker and with the support of 
        both the Carter and the Reagan Administrations, dramatically slowed the 
        growth of money. Initially, the economy fell into recession and inflation 
        receded. However, most important, when activity staged a vigorous recovery, 
        the progress made in reducing inflation was largely preserved. By the 
        end of the 1980s, the inflation climate was being altered dramatically. 
      </p>
      <p>The record of the past twenty years appears to underscore the observation 
        that, although pressures for excess issuance of fiat money are chronic, 
        a prudent monetary policy maintained over a protracted period can contain 
        the forces of inflation. With the story of most major economies in the 
        postwar period being the emergence of, and then battle against inflation, 
        concerns about <em>deflation</em>, one of the banes of an earlier century, 
        seldom surfaced. The recent experience of Japan has certainly refocused 
        attention on the possibility that an unanticipated fall in the general 
        price level would convert the otherwise relatively manageable level of 
        nominal debt held by households and businesses into a corrosive rising 
        level of real debt and real debt service costs. It now appears that we 
        have learned that deflation, as well as inflation, are in the long run 
        monetary phenomena, to extend Milton Friedman's famous dictum. </p>
      <p>To be sure, in the short to medium run, many forces are at play that 
        complicate the link between money and prices. The widening globalization 
        of market economies in recent years, for example, is integrating a growing 
        share of previously local capacity into an operationally meaningful world 
        total. That process has, at least for a time, brought substantial new 
        supplies of goods and services to global markets. In addition, the more 
        rapid rate of technological innovation, so evident in the United States, 
        has boosted the pace at which our productive potential is expanding. These 
        shifts in aggregate supply--whether foreign or domestic in origin--influence 
        the relationship between money and prices. Moreover, the tie between money 
        and prices can be altered by dysfunctional financial intermediation, as 
        we have witnessed in Japan. Thus, recent experience understandably has 
        stimulated policymakers worldwide to refocus on deflation and its consequences, 
        decades after dismissing it as a possibility so remote that it no longer 
        warranted serious attention. </p>
      <p>The meaning of deflation and the characteristics that differentiate it 
        from the more usual experience of inflation are subjects being actively 
        studied inside and outside of central banks. As I testified before the 
        Congress last month, the United States is nowhere close to sliding into 
        a pernicious deflation. Moreover, a major objective of the recent heightened 
        level of scrutiny is to ensure that any latent deflationary pressures 
        are appropriately addressed well before they became a problem.</p>
      <p align="center"> * * * * *</p>
      <p>Central bankers have long believed that price <em>stability</em> is conducive 
        to achieving maximum sustainable growth. Historically, debilitating risk 
        premiums have tended to rise with both expected inflation and deflation, 
        and they have been minimized during conditions of approximate price stability. 
      </p>
      <p>Although the U.S. economy has largely escaped any deflation since World 
        War II, there are some well-founded reasons to presume that deflation 
        is more of a threat to economic growth than is inflation. For one, the 
        lower bound on nominal interest rates at zero threatens ever-rising real 
        rates if deflation intensifies. A related consequence is that even if 
        debtors are able to refinance loans at zero nominal interest rates, they 
        may still face high and rising real rates that cause their balance sheets 
        to deteriorate. </p>
      <p>Another concern about deflation resides in labor markets. Some studies 
        have suggested that nominal wages do not easily adjust downward. If lower 
        price inflation is accompanied by lower average wage inflation, then the 
        prevalence of nominal wages being constrained from falling could increase 
        as price inflation moves toward or below zero. In these circumstances, 
        the effective clearing of labor markets would be inhibited, with the consequence 
        being higher rates of unemployment. </p>
      <p>Taken together, these considerations suggest that deflation could well 
        be more damaging than inflation to economic growth. While this asymmetry 
        should not be overlooked, several factors limit its significance. In particular, 
        more rapid advances in productivity can make this asymmetry less severe. 
        Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances 
        of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest 
        rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting 
        economic growth. Moreover, to the extent that more-rapid growth of productivity 
        shows through to faster gains in nominal wages, there will be fewer instances 
        in which nominal wages will be pressured to fall. </p>
      <p>One also should not overstate the difficulties posed for monetary policy 
        by the zero bound on interest rates and nominal wage inflexibility even 
        in the absence of faster productivity growth. The expansion of the monetary 
        base can proceed even if overnight rates are driven to their zero lower 
        bound. The Federal Reserve has authority to purchase Treasury securities 
        of any maturity and indeed already purchases such securities as part of 
        its procedures to keep the overnight rate at its desired level. This authority 
        could be used to lower interest rates at longer maturities. Such actions 
        have precedent: Between 1942 and 1951, the Federal Reserve put a ceiling 
        on longer-term Treasury yields at 2-1/2 percent. With respect to potential 
        difficulties in labor markets, results from research remain ambiguous 
        on the extent and persistence of downward rigidity in nominal compensation. 
      </p>
      <p>Clearly, it would be desirable to avoid deflation. But if deflation were 
        to develop, options for an aggressive monetary policy response are available. 
      </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the ability of our economy to weather the many shocks inflicted 
        on it since the spring of 2000 attests to our market system's remarkable 
        resilience. That characteristic is far more evident today than two or 
        three decades ago. There may be numerous causes of this increased resilience.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a> 
        Among them, ongoing efforts to liberalize global trade have added flexibility 
        to many aspects of our economy over time. Furthermore, a quarter-century 
        of bipartisan deregulation has significantly reduced inflexibilities in 
        our markets for energy, transportation, communication, and financial services. 
        And, of course, the dramatic gains in information technology have markedly 
        improved the ability of businesses to address festering economic imbalances 
        before they inflict significant damage. This improved ability has been 
        further facilitated by the increasing willingness of our workers to embrace 
        innovation more generally. Irrespective of how deflationary forces might 
        influence it, our economy has the benefit of enhanced flexibility, which 
        has, at least to date, allowed us to withstand the potentially destabilizing 
        effects of some substantial negative shocks. </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>Certainly, lurking in the background of any evaluation of deflation risks 
        is the concern that those forces could be unleashed by a bursting bubble 
        in asset prices. This connection, real or speculative, raises some interesting 
        questions about the most effective approach to the conduct of monetary 
        policy. If the bursting of an asset bubble creates economic dislocation, 
        then preventing bubbles might seem an attractive goal. But whether incipient 
        bubbles can be detected in real time and whether, once detected, they 
        can be defused without inadvertently precipitating still greater adverse 
        consequences for the economy remain in doubt. </p>
      <p>It may be useful, as a first step, to consider both the economic circumstances 
        most likely to impede the development of bubbles and the circumstances 
        most conducive to their formation. Destabilizing macroeconomic policies 
        and poor economic performance are not likely to provide fertile ground 
        for the optimism that usually accompanies surging asset prices. </p>
      <p>Ironically, low inflation, economic stability, and low risk premiums 
        may provide tinder for asset price speculation that could be sparked should 
        technological innovations open up new opportunities for profitable investment. 
        Even in such circumstances, bubble pricing is likely to be inhibited for 
        a company with a history. To be sure, the stock prices of old-line companies 
        do rise somewhat through arbitrage when the market as a whole is propelled 
        higher by stock prices of cutting-edge technologies. But it is difficult 
        to imagine stock prices of most well-established and seasoned old-line 
        companies surging to wholly unsustainable heights. With some prominent 
        exceptions, their capabilities for future profits have been largely tested 
        and delimited. </p>
      <p>The situation is likely different in the case of a new company that employs 
        an innovative technology. Under these circumstances, the dispersion of 
        rationally imagined possible future outcomes could be wide. If forecasts 
        are unfettered by a need for consistency with the past, investors might 
        take off on unwarranted flights of optimism. Moreover, skeptics find it 
        too expensive or too risky to short sell the shares of such a company, 
        especially when its stock price is rising rapidly. </p>
      <p>The conditions of extended low inflation and low risk were combined with 
        breakthrough technologies to produce the bubble of recent years. But do 
        such conditions always produce a bubble? It seems improbable that a surge 
        in innovation in the near future would generate a new bubble of substantial 
        proportions. Investors are likely to be sensitive to the need for asset 
        prices to be backed ultimately by an ongoing stream of earnings. Hence, 
        a further necessary condition for the emergence of a bubble is the passage 
        of sufficient time to erode the traumatic memories of earlier post-bubble 
        experiences. </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>Most standard macroeconomic models fitted to the experience of recent 
        decades imply that a distortion in valuation ratios induced by a bubble 
        can be offset by adopting a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy. 
        According to such models, a tighter monetary policy, on average, credibly 
        constrains demand and lowers asset prices, all else being equal. These 
        models can also be interpreted to suggest that incremental monetary tightening 
        can gradually deflate stock prices. But that conclusion is a consequence 
        of the model's construction. It is not based on evidence drawn from history. 
        In fact, history indicates that bubbles tend to deflate not gradually 
        and linearly but suddenly, unpredictably, and often violently. In addition, 
        the degree of monetary tightening that would be required to contain or 
        offset a bubble of any substantial dimension appears to be so great as 
        to risk an unacceptable amount of collateral damage to the wider economy. 
      </p>
      <p>The evidence of recent years, as well as the events of the late 1920s, 
        casts doubt on the proposition that bubbles can be defused gradually. 
        As I related this summer at the annual Jackson Hole symposium sponsored 
        by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, "...our experience over the past 
        fifteen years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices 
        without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent 
        <em>increases</em> in the level of stock prices....Such data suggest that 
        nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a 
        significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble. 
        The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have been calibrated 
        to prevent the late 1990s bubble is almost surely illusion."<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2" id="f2"></a></p>
      <p> In short, unless a model can be specified to capture the apparent market 
        tendency toward bidding stock prices higher in response to monetary policies 
        aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, the accompanying forecasts 
        will belie recent experience. Faced with this uncertainty, the Federal 
        Reserve has focused on policies that would, as I testified before the 
        Congress in 1999, "...mitigate the fallout [of an asset bubble] when it 
        occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion."<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a> 
        The Federal Open Market Committee chose, as you know, to embark on an 
        aggressive course of monetary easing two years ago once it became apparent 
        that a variety of forces, including importantly the slump in household 
        wealth that resulted from the decline in stock prices, were restraining 
        inflation pressures and economic activity. </p>
      <p>It is too soon to judge the final outcome of the strategy that we adopted. 
        The contractionary impulse from the decline in equity prices appeared 
        to be diminishing around the middle of this year. But then the fallout 
        for stock prices from corporate governance malfeasance, argued by some 
        as having been spawned by the bubble, became more intense. This, in turn, 
        damped capital investment and trimmed inventory plans. More recently, 
        of course, geopolitical risk has risen markedly, further weighing on demand. 
        Though unrelated to the bubble burst of 2000, it has muddied the evaluation 
        of the post-bubble economy. </p>
      <p>If the postmortem of recent monetary policy shows that the results of 
        addressing the bubble only after it bursts are unsatisfactory, we would 
        be left with less-appealing choices for the future. In that case, finding 
        ways to identify bubbles and to contain their progress would be desirable, 
        though history cautions that prospects for success appear slim. </p>
      <p>The difficulties that policymakers and private agents face become especially 
        acute as an economic expansion lengthens. The decline in risk premiums 
        under these circumstances presumably results, in part, from rational appraisals. 
        In an economy in which the business cycle has averaged four years in length 
        over a protracted period, households and businesses would doubtless become 
        more cautious in the fourth year of a new cycle. But how do they behave 
        when, as for the past two decades, expansions have been long and cyclical 
        downturns have been exceptionally rare? After five or six years of uninterrupted 
        expansion, is it irrational or even unreasonable to assume that expansion 
        would continue for the subsequent six months? Thus, it was disturbing 
        to observe risk seemingly being priced so cheaply in late 1997 when BBB 
        corporate spreads over ten-year Treasuries sunk to only 70 basis points. 
        That spread is now about 250 basis points, although it has narrowed significantly 
        in recent weeks. </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>Weaving a monetary policy path through the thickets of bubbles and deflations 
        and their possible aftermath is not something with which modern central 
        bankers have had much experience. </p>
      <p>As I noted earlier, it seems ironic that a monetary policy that is successful 
        in inducing stability may inadvertently be sowing the seeds of instability 
        associated with asset bubbles. I trust that the use by the central bank 
        of deliberately inflationary policy as protection against bubbles can 
        be readily dismissed. While the current episode has not yet concluded, 
        it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy 
        to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting 
        to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy. Moderate 
        inflation might possibly inhibit bubbles, though at some cost of reduced 
        economic efficiency. However, I doubt that such policies could be sustained 
        or well-controlled by central banks. Among our realistically limited alternatives, 
        dealing aggressively with the aftermath of a bubble appears the most likely 
        to avert long-term damage to the economy.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of history's verdict on a policy that addresses only the aftermath 
        of bubbles, we still need to improve our understanding of the dynamics 
        of bubbles and deflation to contain the latter, if not the former.</p>
      <p align="center"> * * * * *</p>
      <p>Before closing this evening, I would like to take a few minutes to address 
        recent economic developments. </p>
      <p>As I pointed out earlier, the U.S. economy exhibited considerable resilience 
        to a series of post-boom shocks. The list is rather impressive: First, 
        a halving of stock prices and household equity wealth; second, a dramatic 
        decline in capital expenditures; third, the tragic events of September 
        11; fourth, the disturbing evidence of corporate malfeasance; and fifth, 
        the recent escalation of geopolitical risks. I would scarcely state that 
        our economy was not shaken by these series of shocks, one on top of the 
        other. But after we experienced a mild recession, real GDP grew in excess 
        of 3 percent over the year ending in the third quarter. </p>
      <p>The recovery, however, ran into resistance in the summer, apparently 
        as a consequence of a renewed weakening in equity prices, further revelations 
        of corporate malfeasance, and then the heightened geopolitical risks. 
        Concern on our part led the Federal Open Market Committee to reduce its 
        targeted federal funds rate 50 basis points at our early November meeting 
        as some insurance against the possibility that the weakening would gain 
        some footing. Although our most probable forecast already was that growth 
        would pick up, we judged the cost of the insurance provided by additional 
        easing as exceptionally modest because we viewed the risk of an imminent 
        rise in inflation as remote. </p>
      <p>The limited evidence since the November easing has supported our view 
        that the U.S. economy has been working its way through a soft patch. And 
        the patch has certainly been soft. The labor market has remained subdued, 
        as businesses apparently have been reluctant to add to payrolls. The manufacturing 
        sector remains especially damped, and nonresidential construction has 
        trended lower. By all reports, state and local governments continue to 
        struggle with deterioration in their fiscal conditions. Oil prices have 
        recently risen and, not least, the economies of most of our major trading 
        partners have shown little vigor. </p>
      <p>Still, low interest rates and rapid advances in productivity have been 
        providing considerable support to economic activity. Those influences 
        have been most evident on consumer spending and new home sales, which 
        have been remarkably firm this year. Motor vehicle sales have been supported 
        by low financing costs, by high levels of customer incentives, and by 
        high rates of vehicle scrappage and multiple car ownership. More broadly, 
        strong growth of labor productivity, supplemented by reduced tax payments, 
        has provided a boost both to incomes and to spending. Meanwhile, new home 
        sales have been buoyed by low mortgage interest rates as well as favorable 
        demographics. </p>
      <p>Cash borrowed in the process of mortgage refinancing, an important support 
        for consumer outlays this past year, is bound to contract at some point, 
        as average interest rates on households' total mortgage portfolio converges 
        to interest rates on new mortgages. However, applications for refinancing, 
        while off their peaks, remain high. Moreover, simply processing the backlog 
        of earlier applications will take some time, and this factor alone suggests 
        continued significant refinancing originations and cash-outs into the 
        early months of 2003. </p>
      <p>Corporate risk-taking underwent pronounced retrenchment following the 
        traumatic disclosures of corporate malfeasance this summer. Capital appropriations 
        slowed noticeably across a broad spectrum of American industries. Aggressive 
        accounting practices seemingly disappeared virtually overnight. I would 
        not be surprised if further disclosures of questionable practices were 
        to surface in the months ahead, but I would be quite surprised if such 
        practices were introduced after mid-2002. </p>
      <p>Since early October, conditions in financial markets have turned less 
        adverse. Stock prices have, on net, moved up, and corporate yield spreads, 
        especially for below-investment-grade debt instruments, have narrowed 
        significantly. Those spreads, nevertheless, remain quite elevated relative 
        to their readings of early 2000. Credit derivative default swaps have 
        improved recently in line with yield spreads. The overall cost of business 
        capital has clearly declined, inducing in recent weeks increased issuance 
        of bonds of all grades and halting the runoff of commercial paper and 
        business bank loans. </p>
      <p>The recent increase in the expansion of business credit may hint at some 
        stirring in capital investment, but it is simply too early to tell. There 
        is evidence that some corporate managers are beginning to tentatively 
        venture out on the risk scale. New orders for capital goods equipment 
        and software, after falling sharply over the preceding two years, have 
        stabilized and in some cases turned up in nominal terms this year--an 
        improvement, to be sure, but not necessarily the beginnings of a vigorous 
        recovery. </p>
      <p>In the end, capital investment will be most dependent on the outlook 
        for profits and the resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the business 
        outlook and the geopolitical situation. These considerations at present 
        impose a rather formidable barrier to new investment. Profit margins have 
        been running a little higher this year than last, aided importantly by 
        strong growth in labor productivity. But a lack of pricing power remains 
        evident for most corporations. A more vigorous and broad-based pickup 
        in capital spending will almost surely require further gains in corporate 
        profits and cash flows. </p>
      <p>A full enumeration of the caveats surrounding the economic outlook would, 
        as usual, be lengthy. But often-cited concerns about the levels of debt 
        and debt-servicing costs of households and firms appear a bit stretched. 
        The combination of household mortgage and consumer debt as a share of 
        disposable income has moved up to a historically high level. But the upward 
        trend in the series reflects, in part, financial innovations that have 
        increased access to credit markets for many households. These innovations 
        include the development of a deep secondary market for home mortgages, 
        along with the advent of credit scoring and automated underwriting models 
        that have enhanced the ability of loan officers and credit card companies 
        to identify good credit risks. These innovations lower the risk level 
        of any given amount of debt. </p>
      <p>To be sure, the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to their income 
        is high by historical norms. But, as a consequence of low interest rates, 
        the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income 
        is roughly in line with the historical average. Moreover, owing to continued 
        large gains in residential real estate values, equity in homes has continued 
        to rise despite very large debt-financed extractions. Adding in the fixed 
        costs associated with other financial obligations, such as rental payments 
        of tenants, consumer installment credit, and auto leases, the total servicing 
        costs faced by households relative to their income appears somewhat elevated 
        compared with longer-run averages. But arguably they are not a significant 
        cause for concern. </p>
      <p>Some strain from corporate debt burdens became evident as rates of return 
        on capital projects financed with debt fell short of expectations over 
        the past several years. While overall debt has not been paid down, corporations 
        have significantly increased holdings of cash and have reduced their near-term 
        debt obligations by issuing bonds to pay down commercial paper and bank 
        loans. </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p> In early 2000, as financial imbalances and increased risk brought the 
        surge in capital investment to an end, significant profitable opportunities 
        remained to be exploited. One must presume that they still exist and may 
        well have been enlarged by subsequent technological advances. Indeed, 
        one of the most remarkable features of the performance of the U.S. economy 
        over the past year had been the extraordinary gains in productivity. The 
        increase in output per hour over the year ending in the third-quarter--5-1/2 
        percent--was the largest increase in several decades. That pace will not 
        likely be sustained, but it suggests that the underlying supports to productivity 
        growth have not yet fully played out. Against that background, any significant 
        fall in the current geopolitical and other risks should noticeably improve 
        capital outlays, the indispensable spur to a path of increased economic 
        growth. </p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>In summary, as we focus on the dangers of bubbles, deflation, and excess 
        capacity, the marked improvement in the degree of flexibility and resilience 
        exhibited by our economy in recent years should afford us considerable 
        comfort for now. Still, economic policymakers are having to grapple with 
        what seems to be a much larger portfolio of problems than that which our 
        predecessors appeared to face a half-century ago. The ever-growing complexity 
        of our global economic and financial system surely plays a role. Moreover, 
        the very technologies that have helped us reap enormous efficiencies have 
        also presented us with new challenges by increasing our interconnectedness. 
      </p>
      <p>I venture that future invitees to the Economic Club of New York dinners 
        will not lack interesting problems to address. </p>

      <p><a name="fn1"></a>1. A considerable economics literature in recent years 
        has documented a decline in the volatility of real GDP over the past two 
        decades. Some researchers have argued that the decline in volatility is 
        the result of smaller disturbances to the macroeconomy. Others have argued 
        that improved monetary policy should be credited for the reduction. Another 
        line of work points to structural changes that have increased the flexibility 
        of the economy to respond to shocks. In that vein, I have argued that 
        advances in information technology and the cumulative effects of a quarter 
        century of deregulation have likely played a major role in promoting the 
        increased flexibility of our economy. Of course, these explanations are 
        not mutually exclusive and could, indeed, be interconnected.</p>
      <p> But to the extent that this resilience reflects increased flexibility 
        of the economy, we should be searching for policies that will further 
        enhance economic flexibility and dismantling policies that contribute 
        to unnecessary rigidity. The more flexible an economy is, the greater 
        is its ability to self-correct to inevitable disturbances, reducing the 
        size and consequences of cyclical imbalances. An implication is that, 
        at any given point in time, the economy is more likely to be producing 
        close to its productive potential. So often, discussion of policies intended 
        to improve macroeconomic performance have focused solely on traditional 
        monetary and fiscal policies. But structural policies intended to promote 
        flexibility may be an important complement to standard macro policies, 
        and they may be important enough to influence both the cyclical performance 
        and long-run growth potential of the economy. This issue surely deserves 
        examination and debate. <a href="#f1">Return to text</a></p>

        or defused by financial regulatory initiatives. It is observed that asset 
        bubbles have often been associated with rapid credit expansion, and hence 
        it is claimed that restraining credit growth could quash nascent bubbles. 
        A bubble could conceivably be defused by restrictive credit regulations 
        that stifle economic growth. It is by no means clear, however, that such 
        a regime would be more conducive to wealth creation over time than our 
        current regulatory system. Also of relevance, in a vibrant financial system, 
        such as exists in the United States, there will always be many avenues 
        available to investors for financing a bubble. Furthermore, many analysts 
        maintain that stocks are priced at the margin by institutions with little 
        or no financing needs. <a href="#f4">Return to text</a></p></TD>
