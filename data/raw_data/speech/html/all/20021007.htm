<TR> 
    <TD> <p>It is a pleasure to once again join the members of the American Bankers 
        Association at your annual meeting. This morning I would like to explore 
        the apparent incongruity between the recent substantial losses on corporate 
        credits and the continued strength of the U.S. banking system.</p>
      <p> Over the past two or three years, the U.S. financial system has suffered 
        a sharp run-up in corporate bond defaults, business failures, and investor 
        losses. At commercial banks, troubled loans--including charge-offs, classified 
        loans, and delinquent credits--have also climbed to quite high levels. 
        At the same time, banks in this country remain quite healthy--with strong 
        profits and rates of return and with capital and reserves not much below 
        recent historical highs. Our banks have been able to retain their strength 
        in this business cycle, in contrast to the early 1990s when so many either 
        failed or had near-death experiences. Why is this? The answer may tell 
        us much about the changes in our financial and economic system over the 
        intervening dozen years or so.</p>
      <p> Part of the answer, of course, is that the real economy was different 
        during these two intervals. The most recent recession was less severe 
        and centered mainly in the business sector. After years of rapid growth, 
        capital spending plunged as firms realized that investments in capital 
        goods, especially in the telecommunication and other high-tech sectors, 
        were excessive. The financing of this high level of spending with debt, 
        which was seen as prudent when equity valuations were high, led to a rise 
        in defaults when firms were no longer able to repay bank loans and other 
        debt through equity issuance in a depressed stock market. </p>
      <p> In contrast, despite the substantial destruction of wealth reflected 
        in the decline in equity prices, households, encouraged by ongoing increases 
        in income and housing wealth, have maintained their expenditures. Low 
        mortgage rates encouraged households to purchase both new and existing 
        homes, the latter enabling sellers to extract large amounts of home equity, 
        previously enhanced by capital gains. Low rates also encouraged refinanced 
        mortgage cash outs and rapid expansion of home equity loans. Consumer 
        and mortgage loans have not suffered the sharp run-up in delinquencies 
        that loans in the business sector have, and they have contributed significantly 
        to the earnings of the banking system, providing it with the ability to 
        absorb losses elsewhere, to maintain loss reserves, and still to show 
        significant profits. </p>
      <p> Those banks with relatively large exposures to the business sector and 
        insufficient offsets from other earning flows were able to avoid stresses 
        because they entered the period with both substantial capital and reserves. 
        These positions reflected not just diligent supervision and the Basel 
        I capital reforms but also a marketplace that increasingly demands strength 
        in financial institutions that serve as counterparties in frontier financial 
        risk-management transactions. And bank managers who lived through the 
        late 1980s and early 1990s found capital buffers comforting as well as 
        useful.</p>
      <p> That banks had impressive earnings and balance sheets going into the 
        current period of stress is of key significance. The strong balance sheets 
        lowered funding costs and provided needed buffers. Some banks also benefited 
        from the increased diversification and scale of their operations that 
        had resulted from previous consolidations. The larger banks were better 
        able not only to spread their portfolio risks across a wider range of 
        customers but also to broaden their funding sources. </p>
      <p> An analysis of the resiliency of the U.S. banking system would be far 
        from complete without a recognition of the new techniques in risk management 
        that have been applied in banking during the past few years. To be sure, 
        at most banks the application of these practices has just begun, and even 
        the most advanced banks still have significant strides to make. Nonetheless, 
        the efforts to quantify risk have provided management with a far more 
        disciplined and structured process for evaluating credits, pricing risk, 
        and deciding which credits to retain. In the process, banks are becoming 
        much less dependent on the analysis and subjective judgments of lending 
        officers. Although such judgments in the end are indispensable to the 
        lending process, a methodical, systematic, and quantitative review of 
        facts--including the effects of material new exposures on the lender's 
        consolidated risk--provides a greater depth to risk management than we 
        have had in decades past.</p>
      <p> Improved risk management and technology have also facilitated, of course, 
        the growth of markets for securitized assets and the emergence of entirely 
        new financial instruments--such as credit default swaps and collateralized 
        debt obligations. These instruments have been used to disperse risk to 
        those willing, and presumably able, to bear it. Indeed, credit decisions 
        as a result are often made contingent on the ability to lay off significant 
        parts of the risk. Such dispersal of risk has contributed greatly to the 
        ability of banks--indeed of the financial system--to weather recent stresses. 
        More generally, the development of these instruments and techniques have 
        led to greater credit availability, to a more efficient allocation of 
        risk and resources, and to stronger financial markets. </p>
      <p> The flexibility and size of the secondary mortgage market has been especially 
        important in the United States. Since early 2000, this market has facilitated 
        the large debt-financed extraction of home equity I just noted. That, 
        in turn, has been critical in supporting consumer outlays in this country 
        through the recession. This market's flexibility has been particularly 
        enhanced by extensive use of interest rate swaps and options to hedge 
        maturity mismatches and prepayment risk. </p>
      <p> Financial derivatives, more generally, have grown at a phenomenal pace 
        over the past fifteen years. Conceptual advances in pricing options and 
        other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer 
        and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs 
        of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily 
        deflected in earlier decades. Moreover, the counterparty credit risk associated 
        with the use of derivative instruments has been mitigated by legally enforceable 
        netting and through the growing use of collateral agreements. These increasingly 
        complex financial instruments have been especial contributors, particularly 
        over the past couple of stressful years, to the development of a far more 
        flexible, efficient, and resilient financial system than existed just 
        a quarter-century ago.</p>
      <p> Banks appear to have effectively used such instruments to shift a significant 
        part of the risk from their corporate loan portfolios to insurance firms 
        here and abroad, to foreign banks, to pension funds, to hedge and vulture 
        funds, and to other organizations with diffuse long-term liabilities or 
        no liabilities at all. Most of these transfers were made early in the 
        credit-granting process, and significant exposures to telecommunication 
        firms were laid off through credit default swaps, collateralized debt 
        obligations, and other financial instruments. Other risk transfers reflected 
        later sales at discount prices as credits became riskier and banks rebalanced 
        their portfolios. Some of these sales were at substantial concessions 
        to entice buyers to accept substantial risk. Whether done as part of the 
        original credit decision or in response to changing conditions, these 
        transactions represent a new paradigm of active credit management and 
        are a major part of the explanation of the banking system's strength 
        during a period of stress.</p>
      <p> Of course, sound risk-management techniques require more than adequate 
        tools and diverse markets. Managers must also pay attention to changing 
        risks and respond effectively to them. In this respect, developments in 
        1998 were key in alerting U.S. banks to mounting risk. After three or 
        four years of economic expansion, loan growth, and rising profits, the 
        Asian crisis and the Russian default sent a strong and timely message 
        to U.S. banks to raise their credit standards and more actively manage 
        their existing portfolios to limit risk exposures. I am aware of no other 
        time when banks began so much before the cyclical peak to be highly sensitive 
        to potential risks in either new or existing credits. That experience 
        is indicative, I believe, of how better risk-management techniques can 
        infuse the decisionmaking process with increased discipline and can focus 
        attention on the need to balance risk and reward. We can have little doubt 
        that we have seen a new response mechanism that has contributed to the 
        health of the banking system, one that I trust will be more than transitory. 
      </p>
      <p> To be sure, there were, and still are, substantial problems. Large losses 
        have been taken, and more are yet to be recognized. No risk-management 
        system will ever be flawless, and I emphasize that banks have just begun 
        the process of applying the new quantification techniques. Indeed, quantification 
        techniques require quantities--numbers --to work. The most recent credit 
        cycle has created an abundant supply of exactly the kind of critical information 
        that banks will need to improve their risk-management: information about 
        default rates and the associated losses by borrower and loan type.</p>
      <p> Now is the time to collect and maintain these default and loss data 
        in a disciplined and uniform fashion. Most banks missed that opportunity 
        in the early 1990s, and some are going back at great cost to mine these 
        data today. A decade ago, one might have been excused from undertaking 
        such data collection efforts because of the technology then existing and 
        the cost of data storage. These reasons are no longer justified. Further, 
        the collection of data on defaulting credits, both from past cycles and 
        on a continuing basis, is required to link internal default and loss estimates 
        with the minimum regulatory requirements under the new Basel Capital Accord 
        now being developed for the large internationally active banks.</p>
      <p> Banks of all sizes are familiar with the importance of data in the quantification 
        of risk-management tools. The simplest of these techniques, credit-scoring 
        models, have been in wide use over the past ten to fifteen years by lenders, 
        insurers of loans, and participants in secondary markets. The technologies 
        have been integrated into routine business operations. They all incorporate 
        past data about borrowers to predict and rank potential borrowers by the 
        risk of default. These technologies have sharply reduced the cost of credit 
        evaluation and improved the consistency, speed, and accuracy of credit 
        decisions. </p>
      <p> Credit-scoring technologies have served as the foundation for the development 
        of our national markets for consumer and mortgage credit, allowing lenders 
        to build highly diversified loan portfolios that substantially mitigate 
        credit risk. Their use also has expanded well beyond their original purpose 
        of assessing credit risk. Today they are used for assessing the risk-adjusted 
        profitability of account relationships, for establishing the initial and 
        ongoing credit limits available to borrowers, and for assisting in a range 
        of activities in loan servicing, including fraud detection, delinquency 
        intervention, and loss mitigation. These diverse applications have played 
        a major role in promoting the efficiency and expanding the scope of our 
        credit-delivery systems and allowing lenders to broaden the populations 
        they are willing and able to serve profitably.</p>
      <p> The use of credit-scoring models, whether turnkey models purchased from 
        providers or proprietary models developed in house, has taught bankers--sometimes 
        through costly experience--the value of continually updating the database 
        on which the model operates. Indeed, one can speculate that some of the 
        problems this year in subprime credit card losses may well represent an 
        insufficiently long data series to score successfully such credits during 
        a recession. The experience with credit-scoring models underlines the 
        necessity of basing more-sophisticated quantitative approaches, approaches 
        that seem to have served the banking system so well when applied initially, 
        on a longer and larger database of loss experience. </p>
      <p> Let me conclude by noting an often overlooked fact. The use of the more- 
        sophisticated techniques I spoke of earlier, especially the various forms 
        of derivatives, are, by construction, highly leveraged. They are thus 
        prone to induce speculative excesses, not only in the U.S. financial system, 
        but also through out the rest of the world. The greater potential for 
        systemic risk can be contained by improvements in effective risk management 
        in the private sector, including market discipline based on better public 
        disclosure, and by improvements in bank supervision and regulation in 
        the public sector. To be sure, as I have noted elsewhere, there is some 
        level of risk that must be absorbed, as a last resort, by central banks 
        if an economy is to obtain the full resource allocation benefits of financial 
        intermediation. </p>
      <p> The supervisors of the industrial world have been working together for 
        two decades, through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to improve 
        bank supervision and regulation. The revised Capital Accord, now almost 
        fully developed, places much greater emphasis, implicitly and explicitly, 
        on improved risk-management systems. All of this has the potential for 
        placing even more responsibility on commercial banks for reducing both 
        their own and systemic risk. Most financial institutions will neither 
        need nor be expected to achieve the complex risk-management practices 
        required by the new Basel Accord for large, complex banking organizations, 
        but their operations will not be unaffected. Success, indeed survival, 
        requires that we all adapt. The recent experience of the U.S. banking 
        system suggests that it has begun to prepare itself for the task.</p>
