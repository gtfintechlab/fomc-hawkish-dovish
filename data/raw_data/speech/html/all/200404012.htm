    <TD class="Normal"> 
<P>	Interest rates in the United States have been very low for some time.  The Federal Reserve
targets the overnight federal funds rate, and for almost a year this rate has stood at 1 percent.  By
comparison, the funds rate averaged more than 5 percent during the 1990s, and was last at 1
percent in the 1950s.  Similarly, the yield on a ten-year Treasury note now stands near 4 percent--a level not seen since 1963 and more than 3 percentage points below the average of the past
twenty years.</P>

<P>	These low rates are no accident.  The economy began to weaken in late 2000, and
aggregate activity began to contract in early 2001.  Starting in January of 2001, the Federal
Reserve moved to counter this weakness by lowering the funds rate to its present level in a series
of steps that ended last June.  This prompt and aggressive action undoubtedly served to limit the
decline in economic activity, and, in fact, the recent recession was one of the mildest on record. </P>

<P>	The Federal Reserve recognizes that the federal funds rate is currently lower than it can
be on a sustainable basis:  At some point, as the economy moves back toward higher levels of
employment, policy accommodation will no longer be needed and the funds rate will be raised. 
But it does not appear that we are as yet at that point.  The Federal Reserve has opted to keep its
policy rate quite low and has said it can be patient in removing the degree of accommodation. 
Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been
anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.  At the same time, inflation has been
quite low and shows few signs that it is in the process of picking up.</P>

<P>	Recently, some observers have been calling for the Federal Reserve to begin the
tightening process sooner rather than later.  In a few cases, the reasoning appears to be that we
are risking a major increase in inflation by waiting.  But most of the calls for a prompt policy
tightening are instead based on the concern that the Federal Reserve, by keeping the funds rate so
low and signaling that it is likely to stay low for a while, is sowing the seeds for different kinds
of future problems.  In particular, these critics worry that a continued environment of low interest
rates is giving rise to economic imbalances--excessive indebtedness, and elevated prices of
houses, equities, and bonds--that in the longer run will come back to haunt us.   </P>

<P>	They fear that the return to more-normal levels of short-term interest rates might
eventually be accompanied by an especially sharp upswing in bond and mortgage rates, a
softening in the prices of houses and equities, and problems for households in meeting higher
debt obligations that, in turn, could result in a substantial weakening in spending.</P>

<P>	Those worried about these possibilities say that the Federal Reserve should begin to
remove its policy accommodation promptly to limit any further buildup of debt and distortions of
asset prices.  Most of these analysts acknowledge that such an action will entail some short-run
pain--a slower recovery and a weaker rebound in labor markets.  But they see this near-term loss
as more than compensated for by the long-run gain of avoiding severe problems in the more
distant future.</P>

<P>	Today I would like to examine this line of reasoning.  The issue may seem abstract and
arcane to an audience of non-economists--inside baseball as played in the financial markets and
in the Board Room of the Federal Reserve.  But the approach taken to this policy question could
have serious consequences for the U.S. economy, and it illustrates nicely the types of subtle but
fascinating issues policymakers must confront.  I must emphasize that these are my own views
and not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.</P>

<P><STRONG>The Effects of Low Interest Rates</STRONG><br>
As I have already discussed, the current level of the federal funds rate came about in
response to a weakening economy in 2001 and a recovery that has been characterized by the
persistence of considerable slack in labor markets and low and declining inflation.</P>

<P>	Stimulative monetary policy helps the economy recover from a spell of economic
weakness largely through its effects on interest rates and asset prices.  Long-term interest rates--the ones most relevant to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and firms--have
been held down by easy monetary policy and the expectation that short-term rates will remain
low for some time.  And these low rates in turn have boosted the prices of houses and the value
of corporate equity.  Under the influence of increased wealth and low borrowing costs,
households have bought more and larger houses and cars, have taken on more debt, and generally
have spent more than would have been the case if interest rates had been higher.  On the business
side, low rates have helped firms reduce debt servicing and rebuild financial resilience by issuing
long-term debt and paying off short-term debt, setting the stage for a step-up in investment. 
Stronger balance sheets and higher profits have induced investors to reduce the risk premiums
they require to lend to businesses, which has further supported business spending.  </P>

<P>	Nothing is necessarily wrong with these developments; in fact, they are by-and-large the
intended and logical consequences of the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce economic slack
through low interest rates.  To be sure, when short-term interest rates rise, bond yields will also
rise, the amount of income needed to service debt will increase, and the prices of houses and
equity will begin to reflect the greater competition for savers' dollars.</P>

<P>	 But as long as interest rates and asset prices are reasonably well aligned with the forces
likely to affect the economy, and as long as the public has reasonably accurate expectations about
the size and timing of the eventual increase in interest rates and its effect on wealth and debt
service, then the economy should not experience any particularly severe bumps when these
developments unfold.  Under these circumstances, households and firms, in the aggregate, should
not end up looking back on their borrowing and spending actions as a mistake.  If they do not
view them as a mistake, they are unlikely to make major revisions in spending plans or asset
valuations, and the effects on financial markets and the economy should be limited.</P>

<P>	Of course, expectations cannot be entirely accurate; the path interest rates will follow
depends on future economic developments, many of which inevitably will be surprises, and in
response markets will need to adjust, perhaps substantially.  Moreover, some households and
firms probably harbor unrealistic expectations about the future based on extrapolations of recent
interest rates or trends in asset prices, and they run the risk of experiencing serious difficulties as
a result.  But as long as myopia appeared to be restricted to a relatively small portion of the
population, and asset prices and expectations in the aggregate seemed realistic given what we
know today, we would have little reason to anticipate serious problems as interest rates adjust. 
However, if imbalances were thought to exist--if expectations appeared unrealistic and asset
prices distorted--then we would judge that the potential for a sharp correction in financial
markets and associated economic instability was greater. </P>

<P><STRONG>Is There Evidence that Imbalances are Emerging?</STRONG><br>
Determining whether such imbalances are present is a difficult task, and assessing
whether those imbalances are related to current policy is even more challenging.  But given their
potential consequences for the economy, these are issues that policymakers cannot ignore. </P>

<P>	Let me begin with the question of whether interest rates and asset prices have been
pushed away from appropriate levels.  Some observers worry that recent Federal Reserve policy,
by keeping short-term rates at very low levels for an extended period, has encouraged investors
to "reach for yield"--that is, to shift their portfolios toward riskier and longer-term securities,
which generally have higher yields, to keep realized returns from falling.  They also worry about
the effects of a related behavior in which financial intermediaries borrow at low short-term rates
to lend at higher long-term rates--the so-called "carry trade"--and about the effects of low interest
rates on the prices of houses.  To a considerable extent, these processes are part of the efficient
functioning of markets:  Investors should compare the return they would receive on holding
short-term deposits or the cost of borrowing short-term to the potential returns on riskier assets
and make investment decisions on the basis of the trade-off between return and risk.  Indeed,
behaviors of this sort transmit accommodative monetary policy through financial markets to
accomplish its intended effect of stimulating demand. The issue is whether this process has gone
too far--that is, whether investors are failing to take adequate account of the risks of those
alternative investments.  Forming such a judgment requires a view on the level of asset prices
that would be "appropriate" given economic fundamentals.  Unfortunately, economists are not
very good at this, but neither is anyone else, including Wall Street analysts.</P>

<P>	The Treasury securities market has been one focus of some concern.  Some observers
argue that, in part because of the carry trade and similar sorts of strategies, rates on intermediate-
and longer-term Treasury securities are too low.  An important observation, however, is that the
yield curve is currently quite steep, implying that market participants have priced in a substantial
rise in short-term rates.  Indeed, the current shape of the yield curve suggests that investors
expect short-term rates will eventually be in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent.  This expected
rate is not unusually low by historical standards; it is near or even above the expectations during
the low-inflation period of the 1950s and early 1960s, and it is well within the range of
expectations since the mid-1990s.  The yield curve implies a fairly gradual transition to those
long-run levels, and some could argue that this implied adjustment is too gradual.  However, this
pattern in part reflects the Federal Reserve's statements about policy patience and the fact that
the economic expansion so far has made only limited progress in reducing slack, particularly in
the labor market, even at very low interest rates.  Overall, the question of whether the yield curve
is steep enough is difficult to answer.  Some analysis suggests that Treasury yields should be a bit
higher, and we cannot rule out the possibility that long-term rates will rise once labor markets
begin to strengthen convincingly.  Nonetheless, it would be hard to argue with much confidence
that yields are substantially out of line with plausible configurations of fundamental influences.</P>

<P>	Corporate bonds have also been the subject of some concern--specifically, whether the
risk spreads on bonds issued by domestic corporations, which have narrowed dramatically,
particularly for lower-rated issuers, are too low to offer adequate compensation for the
probability of future defaults.  It would be surprising had we <b>not</b> seen a narrowing of credit
spreads over this period.  Corporate profits have expanded quite briskly of late, and various
measures of business financial difficulties have declined substantially.  Moreover, the outlook for
corporations appears favorable, considering that we are now in the early stages of what we hope
will be an extended period of economic expansion.  Many spreads remain above levels they
reached through much of the 1990s, and while they may be thin, they do not appear to be clearly
unreasonable in the context of recent and expected developments.  </P>

<P>	Warnings about a possible "bubble" in house prices have been sounded for a number of
years now.  About a year ago, I examined this issue in some detail and concluded that, while one
could never be very confident about such a judgment, house prices were not obviously too high
and the housing stock was not clearly too large.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>  Since then, however, prices have climbed
further, and by more than the rise in rents--a proxy for the return on houses.  Consequently, the
odds have risen that these prices could be out of line with fundamentals.  We still cannot be very
confident about whether a significant misalignment exists, however.  Moreover, some factors,
including increasing prosperity and wealth associated in part with rapid gains in labor
productivity and earning power, should help support house prices in the future and thereby
reduce the risk of a sizable correction in which prices actually fall across a large number of
localities.</P>

<P>	Finally, concerns have been expressed about the level of debt in our economy, especially
household debt.  Debt owed by households is high relative to their income, and so too are the
payments required by that debt and by other regular obligations.  But the vast majority of
households are not encountering problems meeting obligations, and they have protected
themselves to a considerable extent against increasing interest rates by borrowing for longer
terms at fixed rates.  As a consequence, debt servicing obligations will rise very gradually even if
market interest rates increase rapidly.  Moreover, any increase in rates would most probably
occur in circumstances in which income and employment were also rising briskly, and thus
adding to the resources available to consumers.  And, while debt has been increasing, assets on
household balance sheets have been rising even more rapidly.  Barring a collapse in house or
equity prices when interest rates rise, household net worth should remain comfortably above the
levels of a few years ago.  </P>

<P>	This has been a very fast and somewhat cursory tour through U.S. financial markets.  But
the main point should be clear:  Although one can never be certain, in my view, the odds are that
any imbalances that have emerged in U.S. asset markets or in the level of borrowing by U.S.
households and businesses are not so substantial that they will disrupt the economy when they
begin to correct.  To be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations
of a benign economic environment--one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy
will continue to strengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities
will remain solid.  Although these expectations could leave markets exposed to unfavorable
news, they are not obviously unreasonable.</P>

<P>	In the absence of any substantial distortions in asset prices and debt levels, households
and businesses, on average, have not likely been engaging in misguided decisions that they, or
the central bank, will come to regret.  Nevertheless, as emphasized above, policymakers face a
tremendous amount of uncertainty regarding this judgment.  Some borrowers and lenders will be
caught by surprise when rates rise and will suffer losses; houses could be overvalued in some
markets and subject to correction; and even small, largely predictable changes in interest rates
and asset prices could interact in unexpected ways.  And asset prices and interest rates that look
roughly in line with fundamentals today, may not be tomorrow.  Because they cannot  rule out
the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must
consider how the economy might withstand such a correction.</P>

<P>	Corrections in interest rates and asset values may have the most potential for disruption
when they impair the financial health of borrowers and lenders and thereby cause them to pull
back even further than might be warranted by the change in rates or prices.  In that regard, we
have some reason to be optimistic that the players are well positioned to absorb these
adjustments. </P>

<P>	We have already discussed the reasons for confidence that household borrowers will be
able to meet their obligations.  Lenders, too, appear well positioned to weather any such
adjustments.  Commercial banks remain highly profitable and well capitalized, and other
financial intermediaries show few signs of widespread problems.  I am encouraged by the way
our financial system came through the very difficult circumstances of the last few years,
including the plunge in equity values, the recession, the subsequent period of slow growth, and
the spike in credit problems.  To be sure, pockets of difficulty emerged, and lenders became more
cautious, but, for the most part, credit continued to flow, and problems remained isolated, not
systemic.  Our increasingly sophisticated financial market was able to effectively distribute risk
so that lenders were sufficiently diversified to survive some quite stressful developments. </P>

<P>	In addition, financial markets have important automatic-stabilizer properties.  If investors
sense that asset-price adjustments are undermining the expansion, interest rates will fall back
because investors will anticipate a lower trajectory for the federal funds rate.  For its part, the
Federal Reserve will adapt its monetary policy to unexpected developments in an effort to keep
the economy on track toward high employment and stable prices.</P>

<P><STRONG>Implications for the Current Policy Setting</STRONG><br>
That brings me to what I see as the implications of this analysis for the  Federal Reserve's
current monetary policy of keeping the federal funds rate low and being patient in removing
policy accommodation.  I hope that the discussion has cast some doubt on the argument that this
policy is generating substantial imbalances in the economy.  I am not disputing the argument that
current policy has contributed to higher asset prices, more household indebtedness, and strong
activity in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing.  But I am questioning the apparently firm
conclusion of some that these developments represent distortions or imbalances that are likely to
correct in an abrupt and harmful manner.  At the very minimum, one cannot reach this
conclusion with a great deal of confidence.  The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not
appear all that large, given the stance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher
interest rates and softer asset prices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could
absorb such a shock.</P>

<P>	Nonetheless, I cannot rule out the possibility that destabilizing imbalances are building. 
Should policymakers adjust policy today to slow the growth of debt and limit potential
overshooting in bond and housing markets?  Such a policy would clearly have near-term costs:  It
would slow the expansion in demand, damp the creation of new jobs, and keep inflation lower
than it otherwise would be.  Those costs could be significant, given that the economy is already
operating with substantial slack and that any further decline in inflation would leave it at
uncomfortably low levels.  In my view, policymakers face a very high burden of proof when it
comes to accepting fairly predictable short-term pain in the form of slower expansion in
exchange for the possibility of gain over the longer run in the form of reduced risks of
fluctuations in output, induced by sharp and unanticipated variations in interest rates and asset
prices.  Despite some signs that values are stretched in some markets, I do not believe this burden
of proof has been met at this time.</P>

<P>	Can actions be taken to limit the longer-run risks without near-term policy adjustments? 
At least two considerations come to mind.  For one, policymakers should continue to remind
people that the federal funds rate very probably will have to move up at some point, and that they
should be prepared for that adjustment.  Households with high debt loads need to take account of
the fact that the interest payments on their floating-rate loans will increase, probably taking a
higher portion of their spendable funds.  Those lending to such households also need to take into
account the rise in rates when they judge credit worthiness.  Households and those that lend to
them also cannot count on large increases in house prices persisting.  Rising rates are sure to cool
the housing market, and possibly could cause prices to soften in some localities.  </P>

<P>	Investors, too, must be aware that short-term interest rates, and hence the opportunity cost
of their longer-term investments, will increase.  Borrowing short and lending long is risky and
not a sure-fire way to eternally high profits.  Investors are unlikely to be able to exit from these
bets before the market starts to adjust; it is highly probable that many folks in similar
circumstances will be trying to squeeze through the same door at the same time, in which case
prices could adjust sharply.</P>

<P>	The second consideration is that regulators of financial institutions should strive to ensure
that these institutions have risk-management systems in place that help to assess and control
vulnerability to potential adjustments in interest rates and asset prices.  In doing so, supervisors
reinforce market discipline.  Banking supervisors at the Federal Reserve, for example, in the
course of the ongoing examination process, have been paying close attention to the sorts of
vulnerabilities we have reviewed and have been discussing these risks with the commercial banks
they oversee.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><br>
Interest rates are at unsustainable levels, and monetary policy will need to tighten
eventually if the economy is to be kept on a path to high employment and price stability.  My
remarks today were not focused on the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and its
implications for policy.  Instead, I addressed a different and difficult set of issues for
policymakers--whether policy adjustment should be made that might make the medium-term
outlook less favorable but might at the same time lower the odds on longer-term economic
instability stemming from possible imbalances in financial markets.</P>

<P>	This issue has been the subject of considerable research and discussion in recent years,
and I have not had time to touch on all its aspects.  In recent months some central banks have
cited similar types of financial imbalances when they tightened policy.  But the economies in
which these central banks operate have been running at higher levels of resource utilization and
have experienced faster increases in some asset prices than has the United States.  My conclusion
is that for the United States at this time, the balance of costs and benefits does not favor policy
action to address possible imbalances.  </P>

<P>	In the process, I hope that I have given you a sense of the difficult judgments facing a
policymaker in an uncertain world and that you have also gotten a taste of the intellectual interest
and excitement of working through such issues.  This exercise is very similar to many others you
would find in the public sector, and so I also hope you keep these challenges and rewards in mind
when considering your career path. </P>
