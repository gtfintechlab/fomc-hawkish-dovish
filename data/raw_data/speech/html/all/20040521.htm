	<p>One of the key financial developments of the 1990s was the emergence and 
        rapid growth of subprime mortgage lending. Because of regulatory changes, 
        the desire for increased profits, significant technological innovations, 
        and liberalization in some government mortgage support programs, lending 
        institutions began extending credit to millions of borrowers who previously 
        would have been denied credit, both for mortgages and for other consumer 
        loans. The increased availability of subprime mortgage credit has created 
        new opportunities for homeownership and has allowed previously credit-constrained 
        homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes to meet a variety 
        of needs. At the same time, increased subprime lending has been associated 
        with higher levels of delinquency, foreclosure, and, in some cases, abusive 
        lending practices. On a social level, one question is whether the gains 
        afforded by these new market developments outweigh the losses. Another 
        question is whether anything can be done to limit foreclosures. These 
        are my topics today. 
      <p><strong>Basic Facts of Subprime Mortgage Lending</strong><br>
        Subprime lending can be defined simply as lending that involves elevated 
        credit risk. Whereas prime loans are typically made to borrowers who have 
        a strong credit history and can demonstrate a capacity to repay their 
        loans, subprime loans are typically made to borrowers who are perceived 
        as deficient on either or both of these grounds. Obviously, lenders take 
        a borrower's credit history into account when determining whether a loan 
        is subprime; however, they also take into account the mortgage characteristics, 
        such as loan-to-value ratio, or attributes of the property that cause 
        the loan to carry elevated credit risk. 
      <p>A borrower's credit history is usually summarized by a Fair Isaac and 
        Company (FICO) credit score. Everything else being the same, borrowers 
        with FICO scores below 620 are viewed as higher risk and generally ineligible 
        for prime loans unless they make significant downpayments. But it is noteworthy 
        that about half of subprime mortgage borrowers have FICO scores above 
        this threshold, indicating that a good credit history alone does not guarantee 
        prime status. 
      <p>Compared with prime loans, subprime loans typically have higher loan-to-value 
        ratios, reflecting the greater difficulty that subprime borrowers have 
        in making downpayments and the propensity of these borrowers to extract 
        equity during refinancing. They are also somewhat smaller in size. Whereas 
        only about 1 percent of prime mortgages are in serious delinquency, the 
        rate for serious delinquency on subprime is more than 7 percent. Not surprisingly, 
        subprime mortgages also carry higher interest rates than those for prime 
        loans. Evidence from surveys of mortgage lenders suggests that a weak 
        credit history alone can add about 350 basis points to the loan rate. 
      <p>The growth in subprime lending represents a natural evolution of credit 
        markets. Two decades ago subprime borrowers would typically have been 
        denied credit. But the 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary 
        Control Act eliminated all usury controls on first-lien mortgage rates, 
        permitting lenders to charge higher rates of interest to borrowers who 
        pose elevated credit risk, including those with weaker or less certain 
        credit histories. This change encouraged further development and use of 
        credit scoring and other technologies in the mortgage arena to better 
        gauge risk and enabled lenders to price higher-risk borrowers rather than 
        saying no altogether. Intense financial competition in the prime market, 
        where mortgage lending was becoming a commodity business, encouraged lenders 
        to enter this newer market to see if they could make a profit. 
      <p>This evolutionary process was pushed along by various federal actions. 
        The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977, and later revisions to the 
        regulation, gave banking institutions a strong incentive to make loans 
        to low- and moderate-income borrowers or areas, an unknown but possibly 
        significant portion of which were subprime loans. The Federal Housing 
        Administration, which guarantees mortgage loans of many first-time borrowers, 
        liberalized its rules for guaranteeing mortgages, increasing competition 
        in the market and lowering interest rates faced by some subprime mortgage 
        borrowers. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giant secondary market purchasers, 
        sought to meet their federally mandated affordable housing goals by expanding 
        into the prime and lower-risk segment of the subprime mortgage market. 
        They now provide many direct mortgage lenders with other potential buyers 
        for their subprime mortgages. Fannie and Freddie are both working on techniques 
        to extend automated underwriting to the subprime market, an innovation 
        that should further lower costs in this market. 
      <p>Some data can illustrate these and other features of the subprime market. 
        <a name="t1"></a><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows the dramatic growth 
        in subprime lending. Subprime mortgage loan originations rose by the whopping 
        rate of 25 percent per year over the 1994-2003 period, nearly a ten-fold 
        increase in just nine years. Even prime mortgage lending grew by a strong 
        annual rate of 17 percent, reflecting many of the same trends. 
        While the annual share of originations accounted for by subprime lending 
        varies with credit conditions and the business cycle, this share has roughly 
        doubled over the same period. 
      <p> <a name="t2"></a><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows one consequence 
        of this striking rise in mortgage credit. Overall homeownership rates 
        have gone from 64 percent to more than 68 percent over this period. Nearly 
        9 million more households own their home now than just nine years ago. 
        A major portion of this expansion in homeownership seems clearly attributable 
        to the increased access to credit afforded by expansions in prime and 
        subprime mortgage lending. Internationally, our current homeownership 
        rate now puts the United States in the top tier of developed countries 
        on homeownership rates, on a par with the United Kingdom, still slightly 
        behind Spain, Finland, Ireland, and Australia, but well ahead of the homeownership 
        rate in most other developed countries. 
      <p>The distribution of this added homeownership looks promising as well. 
        More than half of these new homeowning households are minorities. While 
        numbers of white homeowners did advance slightly more than 4 million, 
        blacks gained 1.2 million, Hispanics 1.9 million, and the residual "other" 
        category, including Asians and those reporting other races, 1.6 million. 
        Nearly half of all black and Hispanic households now own their own home. 
        These homeownership rates are still well below those of whites but are 
        catching up. With respect to household income, the data also show homeownership 
        rates increasing on both sides of the income distribution. 
      <p>A more fine-grained disaggregation of subprime mortgage lending is shown 
        in <a name="t3"></a><a href="#table3">table 3</a>. These data are derived 
        from information reported by mortgage lenders under the Home Mortgage 
        Disclosure Act (HMDA). Subprime loans in the HMDA data are identified 
        using a list of subprime mortgage lenders developed by the Department 
        of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The table gives the share of subprime 
        mortgage loans in total mortgage loans originated by these subprime lenders 
        within the relevant income, neighborhood, and racial or ethnic categories 
        for 2002. Nationally 9 percent of mortgages were subprime in that year 
        (table 1). For lower-income home purchase loans, the share of subprime 
        lending was above the overall national rate, as was the share of lower-income 
        home equity lending. Similar results are shown for lower-income neighborhoods, 
        for the Native American, black, and Hispanic racial and ethnic categories, 
        and for neighborhoods with high minority concentrations. These differential 
        subprime shares do not necessarily suggest exploitation of these borrowers 
        because borrowers with the relevant characteristics may also be worse 
        credit risks, but they bear watching. 
      <p>Finally, on the supply side of the market, <a name="t4"></a><a href="#table4">table 
        4</a> shows the institutions that were identified by HUD as mainly subprime 
        lenders in the HMDA data. Although many other institutions do some subprime 
        lending, a review of subprime lenders identified by this list is informative. 
        In numbers, only five commercial banks were mainly subprime lenders in 
        2002, though these five banks were large enough that they accounted for 
        27 percent of the mortgage loans of the subprime lenders. Similarly, affiliates 
        of financial holding companies (such as City Financial) constituted only 
        19 percent of these lenders but 43 percent of the subprime loans. On the 
        other side, independent mortgage companies were quite numerous but accounted 
        for the relatively small total of 12 percent of subprime mortgage loans. 
      <p>This lender breakdown is important for a reason that may not be obvious. 
        As will be argued below, the growth of subprime mortgage lending has had 
        its positive aspects in bringing credit to borrowers who previously would 
        have been denied, but it has also entailed risks. Subprime borrowers pay 
        higher rates of interest, go into delinquency more often, and have their 
        properties foreclosed at a higher rate than prime borrowers. Many subprime 
        lenders operate under the highest lending standards, but fraud, abuse, 
        and predatory lending problems have also been a troublesome characteristic 
        of the subprime market. 
      <p>A good defense against predatory lending, perhaps the best defense society 
        has devised, is a careful compliance examination for banks. All commercial 
        banks, thrifts, and subsidiaries of banks undergo compliance exams on 
        approximately a three-year cycle, with these three types of institutions 
        constituting 45 percent of the identified subprime mortgage loans made 
        in 2002. Affiliates of financial holding companies, covering an additional 
        43 percent of mortgage loans among these subprime specialists, can be 
        revised for compliance with lending laws, though on a less thorough and 
        less timely basis. Independent mortgage companies, covering 12 percent 
        of these mortgage loans, are not systematically examined at all, though 
        they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, 
        which handles complaints about these entities and may take enforcement 
        measures. 
      <p><strong>Homeownership and Delinquencies</strong><br>
        The obvious advantage of the expansion of subprime mortgage credit is 
        the rise in credit opportunities and homeownership. Because of innovations 
        in the prime and subprime mortgage market, nearly 9 million new homeowners 
        are now able to live in their own homes, improve their neighborhoods, 
        and use their homes to build wealth. Studies of neighborhood effects consistently 
        impute a large importance to the rate of homeownership in encouraging 
        a host of positive spillover benefits. In addition, subprime lending has 
        enabled millions of cash-strapped home owners to liquefy the equity in 
        their homes to help reduce the burden of other financial obligations or 
        to improve their homes. 
      <p>Given the greater credit risks of subprime lending, the obvious disadvantage 
        involves elevated rates of foreclosure and of the incidence of households 
        seriously delinquent on their mortgages. Households in foreclosure lose 
        all the equity they have built up in their homes, typically the largest 
        component of their wealth. There is also evidence of serious neighborhood 
        blight if foreclosure rates, and abandoned properties, proliferate in 
        a given city area. 
      <p>To see better how those trends balance, I find it useful to analyze delinquency 
        rates, shown in <a name="t5"></a><a href="#table5">table 5</a>. The table 
        shows prime and subprime mortgage delinquency rates for mortgages outstanding 
        at the end of 2003. Serious delinquency is defined as mortgages either 
        in the foreclosure process or more than ninety days delinquent--the rates 
        are about 1 percent in the prime market and slightly more than 7 percent 
        in the subprime market. Delinquency rates are also higher in the subprime 
        than prime market at the thirty- to sixty-day mileposts. It is difficult 
        to tell whether delinquency rates are rising over time because the trend 
        effect is confounded with the aging effect--that is, loans of an earlier 
        vintage would have more chance to become delinquent. But from annual breakdowns 
        of these data (not shown), I do not see major trends in delinquency rates. 
      <p>Given the generally low level of serious delinquencies, a purely numerical 
        analysis seems to suggest that significant net social benefits have resulted 
        from the rise in credit extensions and homeownership. Breakdowns of the 
        mortgage data (again not shown) indicate that the majority of new homeowners 
        were able to obtain prime mortgages, with very low resulting delinquency 
        rates. Even in the subprime market, where delinquencies are more common, 
        more than 90 percent of these borrowers are not seriously delinquent. 
      <p>But delinquencies could be more of a problem than such calculations suggest. 
        First, as table 5 shows, another 8 percent of subprime borrowers are not 
        in serious delinquency, but they are thirty or sixty days delinquent on 
        their loans. Presumably these subprime borrowers are in danger of reaching 
        serious delinquency, and they may be strapped for cash. Borrowers who 
        are strapped for cash become vulnerable to predatory lenders and to later 
        foreclosure proceedings. Second, the individual pain of a foreclosure, 
        with the borrower's losing all home equity and most of his or her wealth, 
        probably exceeds the individual gain from a nonforeclosure. If so, a mere 
        tally of nondelinquent new homeowners may substantially overstate net 
        social benefits. Third, there could be problems that are revealed only 
        with a more-refined analysis of the data: For example, delinquencies may 
        represent significant problems for certain racial or ethnic groups or 
        for certain neighborhoods. 
      <p>In response to the incidence of foreclosures and delinquencies in some 
        urban markets and other evidence of predatory lending, housing groups 
        have marshalled new resources to fight mortgage foreclosure. The Chicago 
        affiliates of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC), for example, 
        have initiated a multipronged fight against foreclosures that features 
        data analysis (to determine the source of the foreclosure among the complex 
        set of brokers, lenders, and secondary purchasers), lending counseling, 
        and alternative sources of credit. Many lower-income homeowners are led 
        to high-cost refinance loans simply because they need cash, and alternative 
        credit on reasonable terms can be highly effective in reducing foreclosures. 
      <p>Despite the caveats, the net social evaluation of these trends is probably 
        a strong positive. The 9 million new homeowners, more than half of whom 
        are minorities and many of whom have lower incomes, suggest that credit 
        and ownership markets are democratizing. Millions of lower-income and 
        minority households now have a chance to own homes and to build wealth; 
        and the vast majority of these new homeowners do not appear to be having 
        credit problems. The rates of serious delinquencies and near-serious delinquencies 
        do raise important warning flags and should inspire renewed efforts to 
        prevent foreclosures, but they do not seem high enough to challenge the 
        overall positive assessment. 
      <p><strong>Challenges</strong><br>
        While the basic developments in the subprime mortgage market seem positive, 
        the relatively high delinquency rates in the subprime market do raise 
        issues. Even further social benefits would result if various institutions 
        could agree on and implement changes that would lower foreclosures. 
      <p>For mortgage lenders the real challenge is to figure out how far to go. 
        Over the 1990s both prime and subprime mortgage loans grew rapidly, and 
        homeownership possibilities were extended to millions of households. Ownership 
        rates have now risen to more than 68 percent, and foreclosures are relatively 
        high in the subprime market, an important source of new mortgage loans. 
        Do these circumstances mean that the expansion phase is over, or should 
        lenders seek new possibilities for extending prime and subprime mortgage 
        credit? If lenders do make new loans, can conditions be designed to prevent 
        new delinquencies and foreclosures? 
      <p>The secondary market purchasers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, face similar 
        challenges. Both purchasers have conditions on their purchases of mortgage 
        loans requiring disclosure, limitations on certain practices, and restrictions 
        against inappropriate classification of prime borrowers as subprime. These 
        restrictions may have limited some subprime lending, but they also have 
        had the beneficial effect of influencing lending standards within a portion 
        of the subprime market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be continually 
        testing their restrictions to find a set of rules that adequately protect 
        borrowers without unduly constricting lenders. 
      <p>Housing support groups, such as the NRC, must have a strategy of consolidating 
        gains. These housing support groups are typically in the business of encouraging 
        homeownership. But pushing homeownership so far that all the gains are 
        offset by higher foreclosures does no good. Groups must develop more-effective 
        lending programs, provide alternative and cheaper sources of credit for 
        cash-strapped homeowners, and develop data systems so that institutions 
        and brokers who are facilitating unnecessary foreclosures can be identified 
        and penalized. 
      <p>Federal regulators face challenges as well. The Federal Reserve Board 
        has already revised HMDA to ask for rate information on subprime mortgage 
        loans so that subprime mortgage markets can be better analyzed and understood. 
        Using its authority to regulate high-cost loans under the Home Ownership 
        and Equity Protection Act, the Fed has also made several changes to protect 
        consumers with high-cost mortgages. These changes include a provision 
        that effectively classifies loans that carry single-premium credit insurance 
        as high-cost loans and allows them to receive the protections of the act. 
        Further, as umbrella supervisor of financial holding companies, the Fed 
        is also instituting new procedures for monitoring the lending practices 
        of affiliates of these holding companies, which are responsible for an 
        important share of subprime mortgage lending. The Fed and the other bank 
        regulators are currently considering tightening CRA so that lenders guilty 
        of lending violations do not get automatic credit for their loans. But 
        despite these actions by the Fed and other bank regulators, we still have 
        no obvious way to monitor the lending behavior of independent mortgage 
        companies. 
      <p>There are challenges for everybody. Rising to these challenges will ensure 
        that continued subprime mortgage lending growth will generate even more 
        social benefits than it seems to have already generated.
