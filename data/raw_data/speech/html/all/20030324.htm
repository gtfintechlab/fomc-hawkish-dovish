        Marvin Goodfriend answers the question in his title with a "yes" and, 
        in the process, has provided us with an excellent foundation for a discussion 
        of inflation targeting in the United States. I completely agree with the 
        fundamental premise that low inflation is an indispensable long-run focus 
        of the central bank. Low and stable rates of inflation allow economies 
        to function more effectively, and having inflation expectations anchored 
        facilitates countercyclical monetary policy and improves the trade-off 
        between output and inflation that policymakers face. For the most part, 
        in a regime of flexible exchange rates, the trend of prices over the long 
        run should be under the control of the central bank, and exercising that 
        control to achieve something approximating price stability over time is 
        the way the central bank can best contribute to the long-run prosperity 
        of its economy. </p>
      <p>Marvin builds his case in the first part of his paper by recounting the 
        experience of the United States over the last 30 years or so. I have no 
        quarrel with the overall arc of his story.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>  The rise of inflation from 
        the mid-1960s through the 1970s was highly damaging to the performance 
        of the U.S. economy and could have been stopped and reversed much earlier 
        than it was by a determined monetary policy better focused on price stability. 
        The restoration of price stability has taken time and entailed considerable 
        cost to output in the 1979-82 period and, perhaps, some constraint on 
        policy flexibility thereafter. A number of factors have contributed to 
        the reestablishment of price stability, but surely an essential ingredient 
        has been the attention that the Federal Reserve has paid to long-run trends 
        in inflation and inflation expectations since 1979. We are better off 
        now that price stability has been restored and economic agents expect 
        inflation to stay low and stable. Moreover, this stability has been accomplished 
        in the context of a highly successful policy strategy that, by anticipating 
        emerging imbalances and actively leaning against shocks to the financial 
        sector and the real economy, has contributed to two extraordinarily long 
        expansions since 1980.</p>
      <p> Marvin argues that to extend this successful policy record the United 
        States should adopt an explicit, numerical target range for inflation 
        and the Federal Reserve should strive to keep inflation in or near that 
        range.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>  However, in my opinion, adopting such an inflation target would 
        not be an effective means for locking in past policy practices. I do not 
        believe that inflation targeting, in any meaningful sense of that term, 
        describes what the Federal Reserve has been doing over the last twenty 
        years, or even in recent years, when Marvin claims that policy has evolved 
        into "implicit" inflation targeting. Instead, the success of U.S. monetary 
        policy has in large part derived from its ability to adapt to changing 
        conditions--a flexibility that likely has benefited from the absence of 
        an inflation target. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy has enjoyed most of 
        the benefits ascribed to inflation targeting in terms of anchoring inflation 
        expectations as well as inflation itself. It is the focus on long-term 
        price stability that has fostered these benefits, and I believe that this 
        focus will not be at risk with a change in personnel at the Federal Reserve. 
        Considering these points, I am skeptical that for the United States the 
        potential benefits of changing to a regime of inflation targeting would 
        outweigh its possible costs. Let me develop my argument. </p>
      <p><strong>The Federal Reserve has not been practicing inflation targeting. 
        </strong><br>
        One difficulty in assessing whether the United States has been practicing 
        inflation targeting is in defining the term. For more than 20 years, the 
        Federal Reserve has conducted policy with one eye on fostering long-run 
        price stability over time. The law specifies price stability as one of 
        the Federal Reserve's long-term objectives; its importance to economic 
        performance has been supported by theory and experience; and hence achieving 
        this objective has been a key influence, together with promoting maximum 
        sustainable output, on monetary policy actions. The Federal Reserve has 
        stated publicly many times that it considers long-run price stability 
        both its unique responsibility and the way it can contribute to maximum 
        growth and employment over time.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>  </p>
      <p>Although some might view this policy approach as inflation targeting, 
        this would be a very weak definition. I believe that inflation targeting, 
        as commonly understood and recommended, involves more substance and constraint 
        than this allegiance to achieving price stability over the long run. </p>
      <p>As Marvin's discussion suggests, there are two key elements in inflation 
        targeting. First is the announcement of an explicit, numerical inflation 
        target. The numerical goal is important because putting a number on the 
        objective gives it weight and importance and a focus for accountability--it 
        becomes an explicit yardstick against which to measure performance. </p>
      <p>The second element is a priority for price stability in monetary policy. 
        Such a priority usually implies a presumption that the central bank should 
        act to keep inflation at the target (or in the range) within some time 
        horizon--that is, that the central bank would not deliberately allow inflation 
        to deviate from the target and would return it to the target promptly 
        if shocks pushed it away. </p>
      <p>I recognize that flexible inflation-targeting frameworks can be derived 
        from structures that minimize the variability of output around potential 
        as well as inflation around its target. But inflation targeting is not 
        usually framed that way in practice. In inflation-targeting countries, 
        either the central bank law or the agreement between the central bank 
        and the government usually is stated so that inflation is expected to 
        be held at the target. To be sure, inflation targeting has not meant that 
        countries have ignored output fluctuations. In many circumstances, especially 
        in response to demand shocks, no conflict exists between stabilizing inflation 
        around its objective and stabilizing output around potential. And some 
        deviations from target, of course, are inevitable and permitted; indeed, 
        inflation targeting has become more flexible over time in many countries. 
        But in practice, the presumption still is that the numerical goal will 
        be hit consistently, with the burden of proof on any deviations--and that 
        presumption must be part of the mindset of the policymaker; in most inflation-targeting 
        countries the periodic reports of the central banks are called inflation 
        reports, not inflation and output variability reports. The attitude of 
        policymakers is understandable. Inflation targeting is usually accompanied 
        by elements of accountability linked directly to the inflation target--and 
        to that target alone--and that shapes much of the transparency associated 
        with this framework. </p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve is not an inflation targeter in the obvious sense 
        that it has not had an announced inflation target. Nonetheless, it is 
        interesting to ask whether the Federal Reserve has been an "implicit inflation 
        targeter," as Marvin and others have asserted. That is, has Federal Reserve 
        policy been consistent with the second aspect of the definition above--a 
        priority for placing inflation at its "implicit" target and keeping it 
        there? In my judgment, it has not. This is clearest for policy between 
        1983 and the mid-1990s, as Marvin acknowledges. Over this period, inflation 
        remained above most definitions of price stability, and the Federal Reserve 
        was not actively seeking to reduce it. This can be seen by the FOMC's 
        forecasts for inflation reported in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report 
        to the Congress, shown in <a href="figure1.pdf">figure 1 (3 KB PDF)</a>. 
        Inflation forecasts for the subsequent year were mostly at or above those 
        for the current year, even though inflation was running well in excess 
        of any reasonable notion of price stability. An inflation-targeting central 
        bank presumably would have been setting policy so that inflation forecasts 
        were moving toward the "implicit" price stability target. The Federal 
        Reserve leaned against potential upticks in inflation, but it had no commitment 
        to achieving price stability in a particular time frame; the priority 
        seemed to be on realizing "maximum sustainable growth" so long as inflation 
        was not rising from moderate levels. </p>
      <p>Since the mid-1990s, inflation has been low and stable as measured by 
        the core PCE chain price index--within the range that Marvin has designated 
        as price stability. However, the level and stability of core PCE inflation 
        since 1997 is as much a consequence of unexpected developments as of deliberate 
        policy choices. Importantly, the speedup in productivity growth, even 
        after it was detected, seemed to have greater disinflationary force than 
        anticipated; the broad-based strength of the dollar and the weakness in 
        global commodity prices that accompanied the East Asian crisis that began 
        in 1997 put substantial downward pressure on prices in the United States; 
        and more recently, the recession and resulting output gap have provided 
        another unexpected source of disinflation. Notably, as can be seen in 
        figure 1, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, the FOMC was projecting an increase 
        in inflation the following year from levels already to the high side of 
        Marvin's implicit target.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>  And in 2000 and 2001, the FOMC's projections 
        of total PCE inflation for the year ahead exceeded the 2 percent upper 
        end of Marvin's range (see figure 1). Still, the FOMC took no action to 
        bring inflation down; tightening from mid-1999 through mid-2000 was seen 
        as necessary to forestall a sustained acceleration in prices. It was not 
        until July 2002 that the FOMC projected inflation to remain within the 
        range Marvin takes to be its implicit target.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>  </p>
      <p>In addition, at few key junctures in the past five years, the Federal 
        Reserve exercised a more flexible monetary policy than inflation targeting 
        probably would have suggested or allowed. The first occurred in reaction 
        to the "seizing up" of financial markets that followed the Russian debt 
        default in the late summer of 1998. Although forecasts were marked down 
        at this time, the easing was faster and larger than would have been suggested 
        by Taylor-type rules based on our past pattern of behavior and incorporating 
        an implicit inflation target. In effect, to protect against the potential 
        for a really bad outcome for markets and economic activity, the policymakers 
        raised the most likely outcome for inflation--or at least skewed the risks 
        toward the possibility that inflation would pick up. Similarly, in 2001, 
        easing was unusually aggressive, even before September 11, as the extent 
        of the demand shock gradually revealed itself. To be sure, when one looks 
        back, the outcomes in both instances in terms of stable inflation were 
        not any different than inflation targeting would have sought. At issue, 
        however, is whether the FOMC would have responded so aggressively to these 
        shocks if it had been constrained by an inflation target. It is a matter 
        of how the central bank is likely to weigh the risks and rewards of various 
        courses of action--where it takes its chances. My sense is that, given 
        the stress on hitting inflation objectives, the pressures of an inflation 
        target would have constrained flexibility that in the end turned out to 
        be useful. </p>
      <p>Marvin argues that such flexibility is not critical. His argument is 
        that, in an RBC model with flexible wages, policymakers face no trade-off 
        between stabilizing inflation and the output gap, which obviously bolsters 
        the case for inflation targeting. Unfortunately, though, in thinking about 
        appropriate policy frameworks, we have to leave the comfort of his model 
        for the real world. I think it would be naive to assume that circumstances 
        would not arise in which the central bank faced short-term choices between 
        inflation stability and economic or financial stability. </p>
      <p><strong>The U.S. economy has realized the benefits of inflation targeting 
        for anchoring inflation and inflation expectations without its constraints. 
        </strong><br>
        Inflation targeting would benefit the United States if it would help tie 
        down inflation expectations or reduce errors in private-sector inflation 
        forecasts. The former would give the central bank more scope to lean against 
        economic imbalances and result in a more favorable trade-off between changes 
        in inflation and in the output gap than otherwise. Better forecasts would 
        produce more efficient allocation of resources as private agents made 
        decisions about spending and saving, and it would reduce arbitrary redistributions 
        of wealth from inflation surprises. </p>
      <p>In general, however, the empirical evidence does not support a conclusion 
        that shifting to inflation targeting would produce such benefits for the 
        United States.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>  In some countries, the adoption of inflation targeting 
        (and the granting of central bank independence, which often occurs at 
        the same time) has helped to reduce inflation expectations. But the countries 
        that have taken this step are often those with a history of high and variable 
        inflation, and it has tended to bring their inflation experience more 
        closely into line with other countries. Since the late 1970s, inflation 
        and inflation expectations have come down in inflation targeting and noninflation 
        targeting countries alike. Studies do not tend to show that inflation-targeting 
        countries have gained an advantage relative to other countries in anchoring 
        inflation expectations and reducing sacrifice ratios or in reducing the 
        variance of inflation forecast errors. Apparently, credibility and predictability 
        flow primarily from achieving low inflation, not from the presence of 
        an announced target. As a consequence, inflation expectations seem to 
        be as well anchored and as accurate in the United States as they are in 
        inflation-targeting countries, despite the absence of a numerical inflation 
        target or specification of "price stability" here. </p>
      <p>To investigate further whether inflation targeting helps tie down longer-term 
        inflation expectations, I took a closer look at the sensitivity of some 
        measures of such expectations to economic developments in the United States 
        and several other countries. One such proxy is the survey by Consensus 
        Economics, which records the forecasts of economists and other market 
        commentators over various horizons. To measure how firmly long-term inflation 
        expectations are held, I looked at the extent to which long-term forecasts 
        react to changes in short-term forecasts. <a name="t1"></a>The three columns 
        of <a href="table1.pdf">table 1 (21 KB PDF)</a> give the variation in 
        short- and long-term forecasts and the ratio of the two. Column 2 clearly 
        shows that long-term forecasts have varied no more--and perhaps slightly 
        less--in the United States than in inflation-targeting countries, and 
        column three indicates that they are also no more sensitive to variations 
        in short-term forecasts in the United States. Apparently, long-term inflation 
        expectations are as well anchored against short-term inflation variations 
        in the United States as in inflation-targeting countries; variations in 
        short-term inflation forecasts do not appear to pass through to long-term 
        forecasts in any of these countries, whatever the policy regime. </p>
      <p><a href="figure2.pdf">Figure 2 (81 KB PDF)</a> shows another proxy for changes in 
        inflation expectations--movements in long-term forward rates derived from 
        the government securities yield curve. These are of particular interest 
        since they are related to the "inflation scares" identified by Marvin, 
        which he defined by sizable increases in long-term interest rates. However, 
        long-term rates are influenced to some extent by anticipated near-term 
        movements in short-term rates, which may not be related to longer-term 
        inflation expectations, and so the use of a long-term <em>forward</em> 
        rate in this context is preferred. Even so, these rates, like those used 
        by Marvin, can vary with changes in longer-term expected real rates, resulting 
        for example from changes in the longer-term prospects for fiscal policy 
        or the trend rate of growth in productivity. Thus, these measures are, 
        at best, a rough proxy of inflation expectations.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>Since 1990, long-term forward rates in the United States have risen substantially 
        on two occasions--in 1994 and in 1999. Marvin identifies the former as 
        an inflation scare but, for unexplained reasons, not the latter, though 
        the change in the forward rate is no smaller in the second case. In 1994, 
        forward rates rose in all the countries shown. However, inflation targeting 
        was just beginning in Sweden and the United Kingdom and was not well established 
        or, arguably, credible. </p>
      <p>In 1999, forward rates also rose in the United States in response to 
        strong economic growth and high levels of resource utilization. But they 
        increased as much in Canada and Sweden, both inflation targeters. The 
        exception is the United Kingdom, whose forward rates have been quite stable 
        in recent years. The behavior of forward rates in 2001 is also instructive. 
        The Federal Reserve eased aggressively--more so than other central banks 
        and more so than might have been expected based on its past pattern of 
        actions. Nonetheless, forward rates behaved similarly in all the countries 
        shown. Judging from this proxy, even without an explicit inflation target, 
        the Federal Reserve could strongly counter a perceived demand shock without 
        significant adverse consequences for expectations. </p>
      <p><strong>An inflation-targeting framework is not necessary to lock in 
        low inflation in the future. </strong><br>
        So far I have argued that inflation targeting would not simply replicate 
        existing policy practices, it would not buy credibility or clarity about 
        future inflation prospects, and it would likely reduce the flexibility 
        that has so importantly contributed to the success of U.S. monetary policy. 
        One could still argue that inflation targeting might be worthwhile, though, 
        if its added constraints on central bank actions were needed to forestall 
        a tendency to backslide toward higher inflation in the future. However, 
        a number of features in the policy environment in the United States already 
        provide considerable protection against such a development. </p>
      <p>First, the importance of long-run price stability and its appropriateness 
        as an essential long-run goal of monetary policy are widely recognized 
        and acknowledged. Certainly, this objective for the central bank and the 
        limits of its ability to affect long-term trends in income and employment 
        are agreed on within the academic and central banking communities. </p>
      <p>More important, the key role of price stability is also recognized and 
        supported by the public and its elected representatives. Price stability 
        has been a legislated long-term goal of the Federal Reserve since 1977; 
        notably, it was retained in 1978 when the Humphrey-Hawkins Act was passed, 
        despite that legislation's overall emphasis on high employment. The contrast 
        between the economic difficulties of the 1970s and the successes of the 
        1980s and 1990s likely has contributed to public understanding and support 
        for low inflation. Even when politicians call for easier monetary policy, 
        they usually frame their recommendation in the context that such a policy 
        would still be consistent with keeping inflation low. </p>
      <p>Second, the Federal Reserve Act has established an institutional structure 
        for making monetary policy that militates against forgetting or ignoring 
        the lessons of theory and experience or the requirements of the law. Policy 
        is made by a large and diverse committee within a central bank that has 
        substantial insulation from short-term political pressures. In addition, 
        owing to the length of governors' terms and the nature of the Reserve 
        Bank presidents' positions, there has been considerable continuity in 
        the makeup of the FOMC over the years, which has been echoed on the staff 
        level as well. To be sure, the FOMC has tended to operate by consensus 
        under the leadership of the Chairman, who exerts a strong influence on 
        the nature of the consensus. But it is a committee, and deference to a 
        new Chairman is not likely to be as strong as it has become for the existing 
        Chairman, given his record of extraordinary judgment and success over 
        the years. Indeed, a leader whose recommendations seem to be leading to 
        higher inflation would likely lose influence rapidly. </p>
      <p>Marvin foreshadows and supports his argument that inflation targeting 
        is needed to sustain good inflation performance across leadership shifts 
        by raising the possibility that the "inflation scare" of 1987 was linked 
        to the change in Chairmen that year and emphasizing how long the subsequent 
        rise in inflation and inflation expectations took to unwind. Inflation 
        and inflation expectations did rise in 1987, reversing a decline in 1986. 
        Oil and import prices escalated rapidly, likely triggering memories of 
        similar circumstances in the 1970s, and import prices were expected to 
        continue to increase for some time as the dollar corrected its earlier 
        overvaluation. In addition, strong demand was boosting capital and labor 
        utilization rates.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a>  Consequently, a number of reasons existed for a rise 
        in inflation expectations that were not linked to the leadership change. 
        Moreover, as Marvin notes, inflation expectations had increased a few 
        years earlier and were to do so again in 1989 and 1994, when leadership 
        change was not in the winds. The rise in underlying inflation and inflation 
        expectations was far smaller and less persistent in the late 1980s than 
        Marvin implies. He cites a jump of more than 2 percentage points from 
        1986 to 1990 in <em>total</em> PCE inflation, but this increase was greatly 
        influenced by movements in oil prices, which fell in 1986 and spiked higher 
        in 1990 because of the invasion of Kuwait. The acceleration in <em>core</em> 
        PCE inflation, the measure Marvin recommends be targeted, was one-third 
        as much--from 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent--from 1986 to 1990. The ten-year 
        CPI forecasts of Blue Chip respondents rose from 4 percent in 1986 to 
        4-1/2 percent in 1987 but by the beginning of 1990 had reversed that uptick. 
      </p>
      <p>Of course, erosion of the weight that the Federal Reserve has placed 
        on long-term price stability is not impossible and would have adverse 
        consequences for inflation and economic performance. Inflation targeting 
        with an explicit political mandate to give long-term price stability priority 
        would make erosion much less likely. But it is not very likely in any 
        event, and I would be hesitant to incur the constraints of inflation targeting 
        until they seemed more necessary. </p>
      <p><strong>Even if I favored inflation targeting, I still would have serious 
        reservations about the way Marvin seems to propose it be implemented. 
        </strong><br>
        Marvin notes several levels on which the Federal Reserve could "make inflation 
        targeting explicit," differing by their specificity and whether they would 
        hold in the short run as well as in the long run. They range from declaring 
        that inflation in the long run should never vary much on a sustained basis 
        from recent levels to announcing a specific numerical target range for 
        core PCE inflation of 1 to 2 percent and setting policy so that realized 
        inflation would be expected to remain in that range almost always. </p>
      <p>To implement explicit targeting, he argues that the Federal Reserve could 
        obtain "congressional acceptance" of a priority for low long-term inflation 
        by offering in exchange to participate in policy forums that would allow 
        outside commentators to voice their opinions and interact with Federal 
        Reserve officials. However, this trade is not likely to have great appeal 
        to congressional skeptics, since they already have the authority to get 
        testimony and analysis from outside observers and critics of monetary 
        policy. Indeed, such hearings used to be a regular feature in the weeks 
        leading up to semiannual monetary policy hearings. </p>
      <p>More fundamental is the issue of "congressional acceptance." Marvin does 
        not specify what he means by this, which is problematic because it could 
        encompass a variety of interactions between the central bank and the legislature. 
        In my view, because the Federal Reserve, appropriately, has limited "goal 
        independence," it has little scope for announcing a numerical inflation 
        target that would tend to constrain its actions without explicit authorization 
        and direction from new legislation. </p>
      <p>The place of an independent central bank in a democratic society is finely 
        balanced. In exchange for insulation from political pressures, the central 
        bank agrees to strive for the objectives it has been given by the elected 
        representatives. The Federal Reserve has already exercised considerable 
        discretion in interpreting its "dual mandate" of price stability and maximum 
        employment in ways it has made clear in its testimonies and reports. In 
        the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction 
        of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target 
        that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially 
        damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash. The Congress 
        has had several opportunities over the past 15 years to consider bills 
        proposed by legislators to make price stability the primary goal of the 
        Federal Reserve, and it has not passed them nor even given them serious 
        consideration. This statement does not necessarily imply that the Congress 
        would oppose such a step if it were asked again--especially if the Federal 
        Reserve were strongly behind the proposal. But it does reinforce the view 
        that it should be asked, and actions to adopt and give priority to numerical 
        inflation targets should await explicit legislative authorization. Moreover, 
        acting without specific authorization would abrogate one of the important 
        advantages of inflation targeting as practiced in most countries--it requires 
        the elected representatives to discuss and reach a conclusion on just 
        what they can and should expect from the central bank. </p>
      <p>This point does not mean that there are no steps the Federal Reserve 
        might consider taking within its current mandate to clarify its views 
        on price stability. One such step might be similar to the first level 
        in Marvin's list--discussing in a general way how recent inflation rates 
        relate to the central bank's view of price stability. A more specific 
        approach would be to announce a numerical range of a particular index 
        that might be expected to prevail over the long run, but with no change 
        in the Federal Reserve's relative priorities on price stability and growth.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a>  
        To avoid the constraints of inflation targeting, the Federal Reserve would 
        need to be clear that the range did not constitute a firm or presumptive 
        target for inflation over the short- or intermediate-term and that the 
        range could change in response to shifting assessments of the costs and 
        benefits of particular inflation rates, to improvements in measurement 
        techniques, and to readings from other price indexes that seemed to be 
        conveying different information about underlying price trends. </p>
      <p>However, I have some concerns about even such a "soft" inflation target. 
        Placing any number on an inflation objective--however much it would be 
        surrounded with caveats--has the potential to constrain policy in some 
        circumstances in which it would not be desirable to do so. That is, the 
        quantification itself might tend to create a presumption that deviations 
        from the long-run goal would need to be resisted more than would be consistent 
        with the policy flexibility exercised over the past 20 years. And I would 
        be hesitant to proceed down this path without some kind of explicit congressional 
        acceptance. The Congress might in fact perceive that the weight on its 
        legislated goals had been changed, without its approval. If, partly as 
        a consequence, it demanded that the Federal Reserve also quantify "maximum 
        employment" or "maximum sustainable growth" and give weight to those specifications, 
        policy could be adversely affected. As we have seen so graphically in 
        the last several years, assessments of the level and growth of potential 
        GDP must be revised frequently, and of course these variables are not 
        under the control of the central bank. As I noted earlier, markets seem 
        no less certain of the path for inflation in the United States than in 
        many of those countries with numerical inflation targets, and so the gains 
        from putting numbers on "price stability" are likely to be limited..</p>

        the views of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Board,

      <p><a name="fn1"></a>1. However, I do take issue with his descriptions of 
        several episodes over the period. In particular, see my critique of his 
        discussion of the 1986-90 period. <a href="#f1">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn2"></a>2. He does not recommend "inflation forecast targeting" 
        in which the cental bank, to achieve an inflation target, aims at the 
        intermediate objective of an explicit, published inflation forecast. Consequently, 
        I have not commented on this aspect of many inflation-targeting frameworks. 
        <a href="#f2">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn3"></a>3. In this regard, the Federal Reserve has been very clear on many occasions about its emphasis on achieving long-run price stability.  For example, in his monetary policy testimony of July 1992, Chairman Greenspan said, "As I have often noted to this committee, the most important contribution the Federal Reserve can make to encouraging the highest sustainable growth the U.S. economy can deliver over time is to provide a backdrop of reasonably stable prices on average for business and household decisionmaking" (Greenspan, 1992, pp. 675-6).  Nearly every monetary policy testimony (and many reports) for the past 15 years contains similar sentiments and reasoning.  Consequently, I do not agree with Marvin's characterization of the Federal Reserve's communication of the importance or priority it places on its long-run price stability objective as "don't ask, don't tell"; the Federal Reserve has in fact been telling the Congress and the public that price stability is its most important long-run responsibility and intention. <a href="#f3">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The level comparisons to Marvin's target in those years are admittedly ambiguous.  Until 2000, the FOMC was projecting total CPI inflation, not core PCE price movements. <a href="#f4">Return 
        to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Of course, the FOMC might have had higher (implicit) 
        targets than Marvin is suggesting, but a policy regime in which one cannot 
        discern the implicit inflation target over several years is probably not 
        inflation targeting. <a href="#f5">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn6"></a>6. See for example, Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and 
        Posen (1999) and Ball and Sheridan (forthcoming in this volume). All empirical 
        work on this subject is handicapped by the relatively recent advent of 
        inflation targeting and, as a consequence, the paucity of episodes in 
        which to differentiate behaviors in targeting and nontargeting economies. 
        <a href="#f6">Return to text</a> 
      <p><a name="fn7"></a>7. This comparison is also handicapped by the paucity 
        of countries for which yield curves are sufficiently detailed to derive
