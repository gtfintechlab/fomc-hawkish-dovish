I am pleased to have the opportunity to address
the members of the Bond Market Association. I know that you have a keen
interest in the likely future course of the economy and of monetary policy, so
I will use my time today to comment on both topics. I will begin with the
economic outlook, discussing prospects for economic growth, the labor market,
and inflation, and conclude by drawing some implications for monetary policy.
As always, my views are my responsibility alone and are not to be ascribed to
my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p>
<b>The Prospects for Economic Growth</b><br>

 Broadly, the economy has shown substantially
increased vitality since the middle of last year, and with the passage of time
the economic recovery has shown increasing signs of becoming self-sustaining.
Judging from the most recent data, growth in domestic spending appears
consistent with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the range of
4-1/2 to 5 percent for the first quarter and at a rate of 4 percent or higher
for 2004 as a whole. One reason for increased confidence that the recovery is
becoming self-sustaining is that the expansion of aggregate demand has become
more broad-based, with households, firms, and government all making
contributions to spending growth. </p>

<p>
Household spending, which has not
slackened significantly at any point in the past three years, has continued its
advance, supported by positive wealth effects and tax cuts. Except for a
modest decline in auto sales (relative to the strong pace of the previous
quarter), consumer expenditures on most major categories of goods and services
were well sustained in the first quarter, as recent data on retail sales
testify. Household spending is likely to continue to grow at a solid pace for
the remainder of this year, especially if the job market improves as expected.
</p>

<p>A question that many have asked is
whether household spending, including spending on new homes, will remain strong
if interest rates rise. I think that consumers are not badly positioned for a
normal cyclical increase in interest rates. The balance sheets of most
households are in good shape: Perhaps most important, the ratio of household
net worth to income is relatively high, not far below its pre-recession level.
Also, households took advantage of low long-term rates during the last cycle to
reduce their exposure to short-term and high-interest debt. Although household
debt burdens have risen, most household debt today is in the form of mortgage
debt, of which some 85 to 90 percent is at fixed rates and thus insulated from
interest-rate increases.
</p>

<p>
The decision to purchase a home is
probably the most interest-sensitive decision made by households. Private
housing starts rebounded in March from a possibly weather-related dip in
February, and sales of new and existing homes during the first quarter remained
close to record levels. I expect residential investment to continue strong
this year. Mortgage rates have risen in the past month but remain low relative
to historical experience, while new household formation, improved job
prospects, and income growth should ensure a continued healthy demand for
housing. However, residential investment is unlikely to rise much further from
current high levels and thus its contribution to GDP growth over the next year
or two can be expected to decline. 
</p>

<p>
Energy price increases have reduced
households' real disposable personal income by about $30 billion since
December. This development will probably shave a tenth or two from the growth in
personal consumption expenditures in 2004 but thus far, at least, the rise in
energy prices does not materially affect the outlook.
 </p>

<p> A key factor in the economic turnaround in the
third quarter of 2003 was the resurgence in business fixed investment, particularly
in equipment and software. That component of spending seems set to continue to
expand as output grows, profits improve, and firms become more confident in the
durability of the recovery. Double-digit growth in real spending on equipment
and software seems quite possible this year, in part because the expiration of
partial expensing allowances at the end of 2004 will lead some firms to move
forward investment they otherwise would have made in 2005. Given the very low
inventory stocks currently held by businesses, inventory investment should also
support growth. In contrast, nonresidential investment remains weak,
reflecting low capacity utilization rates in factories and high vacancy rates
in office buildings, and the improvement in that sector seems likely to be
gradual.</p>

<p> The Federal government's budget deficit is
expected to peak this year at something between $450 billion and $500 billion.
Both increased government expenditures and reduced taxes will support growth in
aggregate demand in 2004, though fiscal policy will provide somewhat less
impetus and may even be slightly restrictive in 2005. U.S. exports are likely to continue their recent rise, because of a weaker dollar and
economic recovery among our trading partners. However, rising U.S. incomes will spur imports as well. On net, the external sector will probably continue
to be a slight drag on U.S. growth, and little if any progress is likely to be
made in closing the current account deficit this year.</p>



<p> 
<b>The State of the Labor Market</b><br>

As you know, the recovery in labor markets has not kept pace
with the recovery in output, an issue that has been central in recent debates
about economic policy. As has been widely noted, the leading explanation for
the slow recovery in the labor market has been the remarkable ability of
employers and workers to increase labor productivity. Over the four quarters
of 2003, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have
risen 5.4 percent, up from an already robust 4.3 percent gain the previous
year. Output per hour probably grew at a rate exceeding 4 percent in the first
quarter of this year, accounting for the lion's share of growth during the
quarter. Although these productivity increases are unalloyed good news for the
  U.S. economy in the longer term, in the short run they have allowed firms to
expand production rapidly while adding fewer workers than would be normal in a
cyclical expansion. I and many others have argued that this situation cannot
persist: As managers exhaust the possibilities for outsized productivity gains
and become convinced of the durability of the expansion, they should become
increasingly more willing to add employees (Bernanke, 2003b). Unfortunately,
the pace of productivity gains and hence of employment growth has proved
difficult to forecast.</p>

<p> If we look past the erratic month-to-month
changes in payrolls, the labor market does appear to be gradually improving.
On average, private nonfarm payrolls grew by 161,000 per month in the first
quarter, up from 58,000 per month in the fourth quarter of 2003. Recent
employment gains have not been confined to a few industries. For example, in
March the one-month employment diffusion index, which measures the proportion
of industries with expanding employment relative to the share of industries
with contracting employment, reached its highest value since July 2000.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have also been falling and are now at
pre-recession levels. The decline in initial claims is consistent with other
data that suggest that the pace of layoffs has slackened considerably. The
rate of new hiring has been exceptionally sluggish for the past several years,
however, and the available evidence suggests modest improvement at best in
hiring rates so far this year.</p>

<p> Although the labor market appears to be sitting
up and taking fluids, it has not hopped out of bed and begun a round of jumping
jacks. Despite the strong payroll gains in March, nonfarm payrolls remain
343,000 below their level of November 2001, the official trough of the
recession, and private nonfarm payrolls are more than half a million below the
trough level. The average workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers
declined slightly in March; at 33.7 hours, the workweek is low on an absolute
basis and barely above the 33.6 hours average attained during the third quarter
of last year, the lowest quarterly figure in 2003.</p>

<p> The data I have cited thus far come from reports
provided by employers, through what is known as the payroll survey. Much has
been made of the differences between the results of the payroll survey and
those from the household survey, which is based on the responses from a random
sample of households.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>
When its coverage is adjusted to be comparable to that of the payroll survey,
the household survey shows a net gain of about  1.7 million jobs since the November 2001 trough, compared with the already noted loss of more than 300,000 jobs reported by the payroll
survey. Since June of last year, when the pace of output growth picked up significantly,
employment as measured by the household survey (on a comparable payroll basis)
has risen by 1.42 million jobs, more than double the increase of 689,000 jobs
reported by the payroll survey. Recent revisions of both surveys--in the case
of the household survey, to take into account the likelihood that immigration
to the United States since 2003 has been below earlier estimates--have only
modestly reduced the gap in estimated job creation.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
</p>

<p> Although resolving the differences between the
two surveys is important, my own assessment of the labor market does not change
markedly even if substantial credence is given to the data drawn from the
household survey. For example, although the unemployment rate (measured by the
household survey) has fallen to 5.7 percent from its peak of 6.3 percent last
June, that rate remains high relative to recent experience and in comparison to
most plausible recent estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment. The
evidence suggests, moreover, that the official unemployment rate of 5.7 percent
understates to some extent the true amount of slack in the labor market.
Notably, to a greater degree than in past cycles, discouraged job seekers have
been withdrawing from the labor market rather than reporting themselves as
unemployed. According to the household survey, the labor force participation
rate has actually declined significantly since the official trough of the
cycle, from 66.7 percent of the working-age population in November 2001 to 65.9
percent in March 2004.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>
From its peak last June, the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage
point, from 6.3 percent to 5.7 percent. However, during the same period, the
labor force participation rate also fell by 0.6 percentage point, from 66.5
percent to its current value of 65.9 percent. The net result is that the
employment-to-population ratio has barely changed since the middle of last
year. Thus even the household survey, its relatively more encouraging
job-creation numbers notwithstanding, paints a picture of ongoing softness in
the labor market. So long as the labor market is weak, the economic recovery
will be incomplete. Indeed, by reducing confidence and spending, a failure of
the labor market to improve could conceivably threaten the sustainability of
the expansion.</p>

<p> One way to see the extent of the slack in the
labor market, as measured even by the household survey, is to ask how much job
creation would be needed to bring the unemployment rate down further.
Underlying the household survey's employment calculations is an estimate that
the adult non-institutional population grew in March by 193,000 people. If the
population grows by the same absolute amount in April and the labor force
participation rate remains unchanged at 65.9 percent, the labor force will grow
by about 127,000 during the month. To keep the unemployment rate at 5.7
percent in April, then, household employment (as opposed to payroll employment)
would have to grow by 120,000 jobs. To reduce the unemployment rate under these
assumptions, of course, more than 120,000 net new jobs would be needed.</p>


<p> The standard calculation I just presented was
based on the assumption that the rate of labor force participation does not
change, an assumption that may not be valid during a cyclical recovery in the
labor market. If people perceive a significant improvement in the job market,
new job seekers may enter or re-enter the labor force as employment grows. To
illustrate the possible implications, let us suppose that improving job prospects
lead the participation rate to rise 0.1 percentage point in April, from 65.9
percent to 66.0 percent. (Remember, the rate was 66.5 percent as recently as
last June.) This increase in the participation rate would imply a total
increase in the labor force (including the portion attributed to the rise in
population) of some 350,000 people and hence a need for more than 330,000 net
new jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising. The implication is that,
with the labor market still in a relatively early stage of its cyclical
recovery, an unusually high rate of job creation may be required for a time to
bring the labor market back into balance.</p>

<p> In short, the unusual rate of productivity growth
has driven a wedge between the recovery in output and the recovery in the labor
market, leaving considerable cyclical slack in the labor market despite ongoing
growth in output. The economic recovery will not be fully realized, in my
view, until the labor market has established a more normal cyclical pattern of
expansion.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a></p>

<p><b>The Outlook for Inflation</b><br> 

Forecasts of inflation, particularly core
inflation (which excludes the more volatile energy and food price components),
are of course another key input to monetary policy decisions. The core
inflation data for the past couple of months have been slightly above market
expectations. More time will be needed to assess the significance of these
recent numbers; possibly, they may reflect the unwinding of some downward
surprises to core inflation late last year. Based on the information currently
available, my own best guess is that core inflation has stopped falling and
appears to be stabilizing in the vicinity of 1-1/2 percent, comfortably within
my own preferred range of 1 to 2 percent.</p>

<p>The dominant fundamental factors
influencing the inflation outlook are the ongoing resource slack and the
remarkable rate of productivity growth. Together, these factors imply that
unit labor costs will either continue to fall or at least remain quiescent.
Moreover, price-cost margins are at high levels (as can be seen in the strong
growth of profits), providing an additional cushion for absorbing any inflation
pressures that may emerge on the cost side. These forces should largely offset
the effects on core consumer price inflation of the rising costs of raw
materials--the byproduct of the gathering global recovery and continuing rapid
growth in East Asia--and last year's decline in the foreign exchange value of
the dollar. As I discussed in some detail in a speech earlier this year
(Bernanke, 2004a), the direct effects of commodity price increases and a
depreciating dollar on inflation at the consumer level are generally small.
This modest direct impact reflects the small share of total costs accounted for
by raw materials and imported inputs as well as the fact that a portion of cost
increases tends to be absorbed in producers' margins.</p>

<p>In thinking about the implications of
higher commodity prices for inflation, one should also make the distinction
between a one-time rise in commodity prices and an ongoing process of commodity
price inflation. Commodity prices can only contribute to inflation at the
consumer level when they are rapidly rising. Commodity prices may well remain
high in an absolute sense over the next few years because of the high global
demand for raw materials. Yet if the <i>rate of increase</i> in commodity
prices slows significantly, as is implied for example by futures prices, the
effect of commodity prices on the rate of inflation will eventually become
negligible. Similarly, dollar depreciation contributes to inflation only to
the extent that it is ongoing; we cannot predict whether last year's decline in
the dollar will continue, of course, but so far this year it has not.</p>

<p> In describing what I consider to be the most
likely scenario for inflation, I do not wish to convey an unwarranted degree of
certainty. Like employment, inflation is difficult to forecast. One factor
that may be of great importance in inflation determination but can be
particularly hard to gauge is the state of the public's inflation expectations
(Poole, 2004). For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in
the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties
to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote
greater actual inflation. More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on
inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the
dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the
public's inflation expectations are well anchored. If expectations are not
well tied down, inflationary impulses that are in themselves transitory may
become embedded in expectations and hence affect inflation in the longer term.
Therefore, an essential prerequisite for controlling <i>inflation</i> is
controlling inflation <i>expectations</i>. </p>

<p> Assessing the current state of inflation
expectations in the United States is not entirely straightforward. Survey
measures of near-term inflation expectations, including those based on
interviews of professional forecasters, individual consumers, and firm
managers, have in some cases ticked up slightly in recent months, though
long-term inflation expectations appear stable. The spread between the yields
on Treasury debt and inflation-indexed Treasury securities of similar maturity,
known as the breakeven inflation rate and conventionally treated as an
indicator of expected inflation, has also risen. </p>

<p>From a policy perspective, a
difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of
headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized
in the monetary policy context. Headline inflation has of course been
significantly affected by the recent surge in energy prices. The breakeven inflation
rate derived from indexed Treasury securities has additional problems as a
measure of expected inflation. As I discussed in a recent speech (Bernanke,
2004b), breakeven inflation may differ substantially from the market's true
expectation of inflation because of possibly time-varying risk and liquidity
premiums. I will discuss inflation expectations further in the context of
monetary policy, to which I turn next.</p>

<p><b>Monetary Policy</b><br> 

The federal funds rate stands at a historically
low level of 1 percent, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has
declared its intention to be &quot;patient in removing policy accommodation.&quot;
As a number of my FOMC colleagues have noted in various public venues,
inevitably the funds rate will have to return to a more normal level. What
considerations should the Committee keep in mind as it plans this normalization
process?</p>

<p>Before addressing this question, I
would like to point out that, in an appropriately broad sense, monetary
conditions in the United States are already in the process of normalizing. I
base this statement on my view that the stance of monetary policy should be
judged not only by the current setting of the federal funds rate but also by
the level of rates that are tied directly or indirectly to expectations about
the future path of monetary policy, of which the yields on Treasury securities
are the leading examples. In part because of the FOMC's communication
strategy, which has linked the future stance of policy to the level of
inflation and the extent of slack in resource utilization, market interest
rates have generally responded continuously and in a stabilizing manner to
economic developments.</p>

<p>The March employment report, which
cited an unexpectedly high rate of job creation, provides a recent example.
Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out
the report's presumed implications for monetary policy. Mortgage rates,
corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with
important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate
demand. For practical purposes, therefore, monetary conditions tightened
significantly the day of the March employment report, notwithstanding the fact
that the federal funds rate itself was unchanged. This episode illustrates
both the power and the importance of clear communication by monetary
policymakers about their objectives and their evaluation of economic
conditions.</p>

<p>With respect to future decisions
about the policy rate, for me two considerations are most relevant: first, the
degree of confidence one can place in the sustainability of the economic
expansion and, second, the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.</p>

<p>As I have indicated, the economic
expansion is showing increasing signs of being both strong and
self-sustaining. However, to my mind, some uncertainty about that
sustainability remains, arising primarily from the slow recovery of the labor
market. Indeed, if one takes into account the long delay between the official
recession trough and the trough in employment, the labor market today remains
at what effectively is an early stage of its normal cyclical expansion.
Although the recent improvement in employment is encouraging, from the data in
hand it is not yet clear that employers have overcome their reluctance to hire
at a normal pace. Additional confirmation that the recovery in the job market
is both sustainable and quickening would be most welcome. </p>

<p>Regarding inflation, as I noted
earlier, the economic fundamentals appear consistent with core inflation's
remaining under control, in the general range of 1 to 2 percent. In
particular, I see no indication that the U.S. economy is in imminent danger of
overheating, productivity growth is keeping the lid on labor costs, and the
effects on inflation of the increases in commodity prices and the decline in
the dollar to date, which are likely to be small in any event, may well have
dissipated a year from now. As I have acknowledged, however, there are risks
to my relatively sanguine inflation forecast. In particular, a rise in the
public's expectations of inflation, whether &quot;justified&quot; by underlying
forces or not, may put upward pressure on the actual rate of inflation.
Moreover, expectations of inflation can themselves be destabilizing, as when an
&quot;inflation scare&quot; in the bond market inappropriately raises long-term
yields, with adverse effects for the real economy. To avoid instability in
expected inflation, and the volatility in actual inflation, output, and
employment that might result, I believe that the Federal Reserve should
maintain at all costs its hard-won credibility for keeping the inflation rate
low and stable. That involves, at a minimum, formulating policy with a close
eye to indicators of inflation and inflation expectations. More generally, as
I have suggested in earlier talks, I believe that the FOMC's credibility and
clarity would be enhanced if it announced the inflation range with which it
would be comfortable in the medium term (Bernanke, 2003a, 2003b). In
particular, policy would be both more coherent and more predictable if FOMC
members shared an explicit common objective for inflation at the medium-term
horizon.</p>

<p>To conclude, monetary policy is now
in a transition phase. That short-term interest rates must eventually be
normalized is a given. However, the remaining uncertainty about the likely
paths of both employment and inflation of necessity implies that the timing of
policy changes at this point also remains uncertain. Like my colleagues on the
FOMC, I will continue to watch the relevant data very closely. The challenge
that lies before the Committee is to manage policy in a way that permits the
economy to realize its productive potential while simultaneously maintaining
firm control of inflation and inflation expectations.

Although recent additions to payrolls are much
greater according to the household survey, as of March 2004 the payroll survey
reports a higher <i>level</i> of employment, by about 600,000 jobs, than the
household survey (on a comparable payroll basis). At face value, this fact
seems to be a bit of evidence against the view that the payroll survey
systematically undercounts some jobs that are being captured by the household
survey. Bernanke (2003c) provides more discussion of the two surveys.&nbsp;<a href="#f3">Return to text</a></p>

<p><a name="fn4">4.&nbsp;</a>
Conceivably, part of the decline in the
participation rate could reflect factors other than simple discouragement.
However, I will proceed under the plausible assumption that most of the decline
is a response to labor market conditions.&nbsp;<a href="#f4">Return to text</a></p>

<p><a name="fn5">5.&nbsp;</a>
My presumption that the current slack in the
labor market is primarily cyclical, rather than structural, is based on several
observations. First, the recent high rates of productivity growth are clearly
above secular trends and suggest that firms have been working employees more intensely,
deferring maintenance, and taking other temporary measures to raise output,
behavior that is characteristic of the early stages of an employment
expansion. Second, I see little evidence (for example, in the job flows data)
to suggest that the pace of structural change today is greater than it was
after the 1990-91 recession or in the expansion of the mid- to late-1990s.
Third, factors affecting labor supply and the efficiency of job matching,
including demographic changes, greater worker experience and education,
increases in incarceration rates, increases in disability rolls, increased use
of temporary help firms, and increased job search through the Internet, suggest
strongly that the sustainable rate of unemployment has steadily declined since the
mid-1980s, to a level below the current rate. The relatively sharp
disinflation of recent years is consistent with that view. Finally, an
increasing tendency of low-skilled workers to leave the labor force rather than
remain formally unemployed has also likely lowered the sustainable rate of
unemployment (Juhn, Murphy, and Topel, 2002).&nbsp;<a href="#f5">Return to text</a></p>
