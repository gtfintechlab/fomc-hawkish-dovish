<p> As a general rule, the Federal Reserve tends
to adjust interest rates incrementally, in a series of small or moderate steps
in the same direction. Between January 2001 and June 2003, for example, the
Fed reduced its policy rate, the federal funds rate, a total of 550 basis
points in thirteen separate actions. Four of the actions were reductions of 25
basis points in the policy rate, and nine were reductions of 50 basis points. Moreover,
the easing cycle that began in 2001 probably represented a more rapid
adjustment than normal for the Fed--for good reason, I think, as I will discuss
later. The easing that spanned the 1990-91 recession and subsequent recovery
is a better example of how drawn out the process of adjusting rates can be.
That episode lasted for more than three years, from June 1989 to September
1992, and involved twenty-four policy actions that cumulated to a total
reduction of 675 basis points in the funds rate. Of these twenty-four actions,
twenty-one were rate cuts of 25 basis points, and three were cuts of 50 basis
points. </p>

<p>Gradual adjustment tends to
characterize periods of rate increases as well as periods of decreases. Even
the policy tightening that occurred during 1994-95, though distinctly more
rapid than most episodes of rate adjustment, involved seven steps over a period
of twelve months, with an ultimate increase in the policy rate of 300 basis
points. Of these increases in the policy rate, three were of 25 basis points,
three were of 50 basis points, and one was an unusually large 75 basis points.
More recently, the eleven-month tightening cycle that began in June 1999
involved five increases of 25 basis points and one of 50 basis points. Researchers
have documented that the Federal Reserve is not unique in its tendency to
adjust the policy rate in a long sequence of steps in one direction: Central
banks in most other industrial countries generally behave in a similar manner
(Lowe and Ellis, 1998; Goodhart, 1999; Srour, 2001). This relatively slow
adjustment of the policy rate has been referred to variously as interest-rate
smoothing, partial adjustment, and monetary policy inertia. In today's talk I
will use the term <em>gradualism</em>.</p>

<p>An alternative to gradual policy
adjustment is what an engineer might call a bang-bang solution, or what I will
refer to today as the &quot;cold turkey&quot; approach. Under a cold turkey
strategy, at each policy meeting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would
make its best guess about where it ultimately wants the funds rate to be and
would move to that rate in a single step. In the abstract, the cold turkey
approach is not without appeal: If you think you know where you want to end up
(or are at least are willing to make your best guess), why not just go there
directly in one step rather than drawing out the process? </p>

<p>As I have already suggested, however,
in practice the FOMC seems to take a gradualist approach. Why should this be
the case? Are there times when other approaches, such as cold turkey, might be
more appropriate? In my remarks I will briefly address these questions. As
always, I emphasize that my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System do not
necessarily share the views I will express today.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p><b>Gradualism and Policymaker Uncertainty</b><br>
Several arguments have been made for the
desirability of a gradualist approach to monetary policy. Today I will focus
on three of these: (1) Policymakers' uncertainty about the economy should lead
to more gradual adjustment of the policy rate; (2) gradualism in adjusting the
policy rate affords policymakers greater influence over the long-term interest
rates that most affect the economy; and (3) gradualism reduces risks to
financial stability. I will begin by discussing the implications of
uncertainty for policy choices and then consider the other two arguments for
gradualism. I will conclude by briefly revisiting the empirical case for
gradualism and then discussing some implications for current policy.</p>

<p> Many central bankers and researchers have pointed
to the pervasive uncertainty associated with analyzing and forecasting the economy
as a reason for central bank caution in adjusting policy. Because policymakers
cannot be sure about the underlying structure of the economy or the effects
that their actions will have on economic outcomes, and because new information
about the economic situation arrives continually, the case for policymakers to
move slowly and cautiously when changing rates seems intuitive.</p>

<p> In a classic article published in 1967, William
Brainard of Yale University showed in the context of a simple economic model
why this intuition might make sense. Specifically, Brainard showed that when
policymakers are unsure of the impact that their policy actions will have on the
economy, it may be appropriate for them to adjust policy more cautiously and in
smaller steps than they would if they had precise knowledge of the effects of
their actions. </p>

<p>An analogy may help to clarify the
logic behind Brainard's argument. Imagine that you are playing in a miniature
golf tournament and are leading on the final hole. You expect to win the
tournament so long as you can finish the hole in a moderate number of strokes.
However, for reasons I won't try to explain, you find yourself playing with an
unfamiliar putter and hence are uncertain about how far a stroke of given force
will send the ball. How should you play to maximize your chances of winning
the tournament?</p>

<p> Some reflection should convince you that the best
strategy in this situation is to be conservative. In particular, your
uncertainty about the response of the ball to your putter implies that you
should strike the ball less firmly than you would if you knew precisely how the
ball would react to the unfamiliar putter. This conservative approach may well
lead your first shot to lie short of the hole. However, this cost is offset by
the important benefit of guarding against the risk that the putter is livelier
than you expect, so lively that your normal stroke could send the ball well
past the cup. Since you expect to win the tournament if you avoid a
disastrously bad shot, you approach the hole in a series of short putts (what
golf aficionados tell me are called lagged putts). Gradualism in action!</p>

<p> In a policy context, the analogous situation is
one in which policymakers hope to guide the economy in a particular direction
but fear overshooting, either to the inflationary upside or the recessionary
downside. Overshooting the objective of stable, non-inflationary growth is perceived
as costly by policymakers because overshooting creates unnecessary volatility
in the economy and delays the achievement of macroeconomic stability. Like the
golfer with the unfamiliar putter, monetary policymakers are far from certain
about the impact that a policy change of a given size will have on the economy,
as already noted. Given this uncertainty, the Brainard argument suggests a
gradual approach to policy adjustment. In contrast, by applying the stronger
policy impetus that may be called for by the cold turkey approach, policymakers
might inadvertently drive the economy away from its desired path, increasing
economic volatility.</p>

<p>Brainard's argument relies on a
specific form of uncertainty, namely, policymakers' uncertainty about the effects
of their actions on the economy, but other types of uncertainty may also
provide a rationale for policy gradualism. For example, because economic data
can be quite noisy, policymakers must inevitably operate with imperfect
knowledge about the current state of the economy. Generally, all else being
equal, the noisier the economic data, the less aggressive policymakers should
be in responding to newly arriving information (Orphanides, 2003). A
cold-turkey approach, by contrast, carries the risk that policymakers will take
strong action in response to information that may later be revealed to have
been seriously inaccurate. </p>

<p>Another potential advantage of
gradualism is that, by taking small steps, policymakers give themselves the
opportunity to assess the effects of their actions and perhaps to refine their
views on how large a policy change will ultimately be needed (Sack, 1998). In
terms of the golf analogy, by taking a few strokes of moderate firmness one may
learn more about the elasticity of the unfamiliar putter and thereby improve
the accuracy of subsequent shots. A related benefit of the strategy of taking
a small step and then reassessing the situation is that it allows policymakers
to avoid excessive reliance on unobservable constructs, such as potential
output or the neutral federal funds rate (Orphanides, Porter, Reifschneider,
Tetlow, and Finan, 2000; Orphanides and Williams, 2002). In contrast, because
they need to determine the optimal policy setting before each action,
policymakers following the cold turkey approach may need to rely heavily on
estimates of such concepts.</p>

<p>Although the idea that uncertainty
should induce policy caution seems plausible, research since Brainard's
original contribution has shown that this conclusion is <i>not</i> a general
principle but depends instead on the type of uncertainty facing policymakers.
A simple variant of the miniature golf analogy can illustrate one important
case in which the Brainard intuition fails. Suppose that the hole lies on an
elevated plateau, so that your putt must be strong enough to make it up the
hill and onto the flat area that holds the cup. If the ball does not make it
up the hill, it will roll backward and out of bounds. In this case, if you are
using an unfamiliar putter, your best strategy is to hit the ball harder than
otherwise, not more softly. Because you don't know how far the putter will
send the ball, you want to be sure that you do not inadvertently putt too
softly and end up out of bounds. Compared with our initial example, the key
difference in this case is that undershooting the objective imposes an
especially high cost. Likewise, in an economic context, a high cost of
undershooting the objective leads the optimal policy to be more aggressive and
less gradualist, all else being equal.</p>

<p>The interaction of uncertainty and
concerns about undershooting may well have affected Fed policy during the
easing cycle that began in 2001. During that cycle, the FOMC faced a worrisome
trend of disinflation, a trend that if left unchecked might have brought the
economy close to the zone of falling prices, or deflation. The FOMC had two
options during that episode: gradual easing, which some observers advocated as
a way of saving the remaining &quot;interest rate ammunition&quot;; or a more
preemptive approach, to try to nip in the bud any further decline of inflation
toward the deflation boundary. In this particular episode, the risk of doing
too little appeared to exceed the risk of doing too much, and the FOMC
undertook a relatively aggressive strategy of rate cuts, as I mentioned in the
introduction. Similar considerations presumably played a role during the
1994-95 tightening cycle, when concerns that inflation might rise significantly
induced a relatively more rapid tightening. Indeed, interesting research by
Ulf S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m (2002) has shown that uncertainty about the persistence of
inflation should induce more aggressive policies. For example, if policymakers
are worried that inflation may be difficult to control once it is &quot;out of
the bottle,&quot; so to speak, a more preemptive approach to controlling
inflation may be justified.</p>

<p>Although we can draw no general
conclusions about the effects of policymakers' uncertainty on the pace of
policy adjustment, empirical studies and simulations of realistic economic
models suggest that, normally, relatively gradual policy adjustment produces
better results in an uncertain economic environment (Sack, 1998, 2000;
Rudebusch, 2001; S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m, 2002; Orphanides, 2003). In practice, then, a
desire on the part of policymakers to be conservative in the face of many
different forms of uncertainty is probably an important reason for gradualism
in monetary policy.</p>

<p><b>Gradualism and the Determination of Long-term Interest Rates </b><br>
A rather different, but nevertheless complementary,
argument for gradualism builds on the observation that private-sector
expectations play a crucial role in the determination of long-term interest
rates and other asset prices and yields. Specifically, by leading market
participants to anticipate that changes in the policy rate will be followed by
further changes in the same direction, policy gradualism may increase the
ability of the Fed to affect long-term rates and thus influence economic
behavior.</p>

<p> Informal discussions of monetary policy sometimes
refer to the Fed as &quot;setting interest rates.&quot; In fact, the FOMC does
not set interest rates in general; rather, the Committee &quot;sets&quot; one
specific interest rate, the federal funds rate.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and
lend to each other on a short-term basis (usually overnight) is not important
in itself. Only a tiny fraction of aggregate borrowing and lending is done at
that rate. From a macroeconomic perspective, longer-term interest rates--such
as home mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and the rates on Treasury notes
and bonds--are far more significant than the funds rate, because those rates
are the most relevant to the spending and investment decisions made by
households and businesses. These longer-term rates are determined not by the
Fed but by participants in deep and sophisticated global financial markets.</p>

<p> Although the FOMC cannot directly determine
long-term interest rates, it can exert significant influence over those rates
through its control of current and future values of the federal funds rate.
The crucial link between the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates
is the formation of private-sector expectations about future monetary policy
actions. Loosely speaking, long-term interest rates embody the expectations of
financial-market participants about the likely future path of short-term rates,
which in turn are closely tied to expectations about the federal funds rate.
Thus, to influence long-term interest rates, such as thirty-year mortgage rates
or the yields on corporate bonds, the FOMC must influence private-sector
expectations about future values of the federal funds rate. The Committee can
do this by its communication policies, by establishing certain patterns of behavior,
or both. I will focus here on the effect on expectations of the FOMC's
patterns of behavior, of which gradualism is an example.</p>

<p> Suppose the FOMC decided at a given meeting to
raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points. What effect would that action
likely have on mortgage rates and other longer-term interest rates that the
Committee would like to influence? This question can be answered only if we
know the effect of the action on market expectations about the future course of
short-term rates. To take an extreme and unrealistic example, if the FOMC had
established a reputation for reversing any changes made in the funds rate at
the subsequent meeting, an increase in the funds rate today would not affect
market expectations of future values of the rate (beyond one meeting). In this
example, the FOMC's action would have essentially no effect on long-term
interest rates.</p>

<p> How can the FOMC ensure that its policy actions
feed into longer-term rates and thus influence the economy? An interesting result,
noted in an early paper by Marvin Goodfriend (1991) of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond and developed more formally by my Princeton colleague Michael
Woodford (2000, 2003), is that gradualist policies may allow the Fed to gain greater
influence over long-term interest rates.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
The reason is the effect of past episodes of gradualist behavior on market
expectations. In a gradualist regime, an increase in the federal funds rate
not only raises current short-term rates but also signals to the market that
rates are likely to continue to rise for some time. Because they reflect the
whole path of expected future short-term rates, under a gradualist regime
long-term rates such as mortgage rates tend to be relatively sensitive to
changes in the federal funds rate. Thus, gradualism helps to ensure that the
FOMC will have an effective lever over economic activity and inflation.</p>

<p>Of course, gradualism is not the only
approach that might be used to try to increase the FOMC's influence on
long-term rates. Cold turkey policies would also likely lead to a strong
response of long-term rates to changes in the funds rate, because under this
approach changes in the funds rate could be presumed to be long lasting.
However, theoretical analyses have tended to show that, in models in which
financial-market participants are assumed to be forward-looking, optimal
monetary policies generally involve some degree of gradualism (Woodford, 2000,
2003). One advantage of the gradualist approach in this context is that it can
provide a powerful lever on long-term rates with relatively modest volatility
in short-term rates. Less variable short-term rates reduce the risk that the
policy rate will hit the zero lower bound on interest rates; they may also
reduce stress in the financial system, as I will discuss shortly. More subtly,
Woodford (2000) has also shown in theoretical models that purely
forward-looking policies such as the cold turkey approach may not be consistent
with the existence of a rational expectations equilibrium in the economy. In
practical terms, Woodford's result suggests that such policies may lead to
excessive volatility in expectations and hence in financial markets.</p>

<p>The fact that market expectations are
key in determining long-term yields has an important implication, which is that
the current level of the federal funds rate provides only partial information
about overall monetary and financial conditions. In particular, a given
setting of the funds rate may be consistent with a range of monetary conditions,
depending on the direction and pace of future expected changes in the policy
rate. For example, monetary conditions in the United States have recently
tightened noticeably, even though the funds rate has remained unchanged for
some time at 1 percent--a consequence of the expectations about future rates
engendered in the financial markets. I will return to this point in my
concluding remarks.</p>

<p><b>Gradualism and Financial Stability</b><br>
A third explanation of gradualism is that a
slower adjustment of policy rates enhances financial stability. For example,
some researchers have argued that gradual adjustment of short-term rates gives
commercial banks more time to adjust to changes in the costs of short-term
funding and thereby increases the stability of bank profits (Cukierman, 1991).
Slow adjustment of short-term rates may reduce financial stress for other
economic actors as well--for example, households with adjustable-rate mortgages
and businesses with heavy needs for short-term financing.</p>

<p>A variant of the financial stability
argument is that the Fed chooses to move interest rates gradually to minimize
the risk of &quot;shocking&quot; the bond market. According to this argument,
sharp changes in the policy rate risk creating large capital gains and losses
for bondholders, which increase market volatility and pose risks for banks and
other financial institutions that hold bonds. Because the Fed has a broad
responsibility to maintain orderly and well-functioning financial markets, the
argument goes, the central bank will avoid policies that create unnecessary
financial stress, all else being equal.</p>

<p>I suspect that this second variant of
the financial-stability argument has some merit, but the case is not as
straightforward as it may seem at first. A problem with the argument is that
policy gradualism does not necessarily insulate bondholders from capital gains
and losses. Indeed, we have just seen that, under a gradualist approach, a
small change in the policy rate may have a relatively large effect on
longer-term rates, because of its implications for private-sector expectations
about the future path of short-term rates. Large movements in long-term rates
translate, of course, into wide swings in bond prices and thus potentially
large capital gains and losses. </p>

<p>To the extent that the FOMC is
concerned about stabilizing the bond market, the key is not necessarily keeping
changes in the policy rate small but in making policy changes as easy to
forecast as possible. Of course, complete predictability of policy cannot be
achieved because the FOMC must react to incoming information in order to
achieve its macroeconomic objectives. However, the FOMC can attempt to
minimize bond-market stress in at least two ways: first, through transparency,
that is, by providing as much information as possible about the economic
outlook and the factors that the FOMC is likely to take into account in its
decisions; and second, by adopting regular and easily understood policy
strategies. In the latter respect, gradualism may be helpful to some degree,
because it establishes a relatively forecastable pattern of adjustment by the
central bank. By varying the pace of policy adjustment, the FOMC may also be
able to provide additional signals to bond markets about its views and
intentions.</p>

<p><b>Is the Fed Really Gradualist?</b><br>
In my remarks today I have taken as self-evident
that the FOMC conducts monetary policy by gradualist principles and have
focused on reasons that gradualist policies may help to promote the Federal
Reserve's objectives. Although theory and empirical analysis generally suggest
that the Fed <i>should</i> be gradualist, not everyone agrees, as an empirical
matter, that the Fed actually <i>has been</i> gradualist in its policies. </p>

<p> The alternative view, most closely associated
with Glenn Rudebusch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is that slow
adjustment is not an intrinsic feature of Fed behavior (Rudebusch, 2001, 2002;
Lansing, 2002). Rather, Rudebusch has argued, in practice the FOMC responds
relatively promptly to changes in the economy. The reason that monetary policy
<i>appears</i> to adjust gradually, according to Rudebusch, is that the economy
itself evolves slowly, which in turn leads policy to change slowly as well. To
illustrate, suppose that the FOMC did not adjust policy gradually but set the
federal funds rate at each meeting precisely as needed to offset the effects of
shocks to the economy. Suppose also that shocks to the economy tend to die
away slowly or that the economy's adjustment mechanisms lead it to respond only
gradually to disturbances. In this scenario, observed interest rates would
appear to be adjusting slowly, but in reality the apparent gradualism would
reflect only the slow adjustment of the underlying economy that the Fed is
trying to influence. To support his view, Rudebusch has presented evidence
that longer-term rates respond to changes in the funds rate less than they
would if the FOMC were intent on pursuing a gradualist approach.</p>

<p> Distinguishing &quot;true&quot; gradualist
policies from policies that respond to gradual changes in the economic
environment is difficult, as the two hypotheses imply similar behavior by
policymakers. However, recent studies that have taken up Rudebusch's challenge
have generally found that both an intrinsically gradualist approach to policy
and gradual changes in the underlying economic environment are needed to
explain the historical patterns of U.S. monetary policy (English, Nelson, and
Sack, 2003; Gerlach-Kristen, 2004). If correct, these more-recent studies
confirm that gradualism is an accurate description of actual Fed behavior as
well as a normative prescription of economic theory. Clearly, though, the
extent to which the Fed has pursued gradualism over its history remains an
interesting question for further research.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
In my talk I discussed three sets of reasons for
gradualist policies: policymaker uncertainty, improved control of long-term
interest rates, and the reduction of financial stress. The debate about the
sources of gradualism is ongoing and I cannot hope to render a definitive
verdict today on the relative merits of these rationales. My sense, though, is
that policymakers' caution in the face of many forms of uncertainty and their
desire to make policy as predictable as possible both contribute to the
gradualist behavior we seem to observe in practice.</p>

<p>I will close by briefly discussing
some implications of the gradualist approach for current monetary policy.
Before doing so, I remind you once again that the views I express are my
responsibility alone.</p>

<p>As you know, in reaction to gathering
economic momentum and an apparent stabilization in inflation, the FOMC at its
May 4 meeting characterized the risks to both sustainable growth and inflation
as being roughly in balance. The Committee's statement ended with the
following sentence: &quot;At this juncture, with inflation low and resource
use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a
pace that is likely to be measured.&quot;</p>

<p>As a number of FOMC members have
noted in public forums, the federal funds rate's current setting of 1 percent
(which implies a negative real funds rate) cannot be sustained in a growing
economy and eventually will have to be normalized. The Committee's statement
suggests that, based on current information, it appears likely that this
normalization can proceed gradually. As I have discussed today, given the
highly uncertain environment in which policy operates, a gradual adjustment of
rates has the advantage of allowing the FOMC to monitor the evolution of the
economy and the effects of its policy actions, making adjustments along the way
as needed. On the margin, a more gradual process may also help ease the
transition to higher rates for participants in money markets and bond markets,
as well as for households, banks, and firms.</p>

<p>In my own view, economic developments
over the next year are reasonably likely to be consistent with a gradual
adjustment of policy. It is true that the inflation rate rose in the first
quarter, a point to which I will return in a moment. However, policy involves
lags and thus must of necessity be based on forecasts. As we look ahead, core
inflation appears likely to remain in the zone of price stability during the
remainder of 2004 and into 2005. Although slack utilization of resources, which
moderates wage and price pressures, is an important reason that inflation is
likely to remain subdued, my forecast of controlled inflation is based on more
than output gap arguments. Other factors likely to keep inflation at modest
levels include continuing rapid gains in productivity, which have kept growth
of unit labor costs at a very low level; unusually high price-cost margins in
industry, which provide scope for firms to absorb future cost increases without
raising prices; globalization and intensified competition in product markets;
and the recent strengthening of the dollar. There are also indications that
commodity prices, with the important exception of energy prices, may be
peaking. Long-term inflation expectations also appear well contained, although
inflation expectations over shorter horizons have risen, perhaps partly in
reaction to the rise in energy costs.</p>

<p> Not everyone agrees with my relatively sanguine
inflation forecast; indeed, some observers have questioned whether the current
low level of the federal funds rate is not already excessively stimulative in
light of the gathering recovery and the recent inflation data. I would like to
make two observations.</p>

<p>First, I do agree that the flare-up
in inflation in the first quarter is a matter for concern, and that the
inflation data bear close watching. Should the rise in inflation show signs of
persisting, I am confident that the Federal Open Market Committee will adjust
policy as necessary to preserve price stability. As the qualified and
probabilistic language of the FOMC's statement makes clear, the likelihood that
the pace of rate normalization will be &quot;measured&quot; represents a
forecast about the future evolution of policy, <i>not</i> an unconditional
commitment on the part of the Committee. Although I expect policy to follow
the usual gradualist pattern, the pace of tightening will of necessity respond
to evolving economic conditions, particularly the strength of the ongoing
recovery in the labor market and developments on the inflation front.</p>

<p>Second, however, concerns that that
monetary policy is &quot;behind the curve&quot; may not fully take into account
a point I made earlier, that the level of the federal funds rate by itself does
not fully describe broad monetary conditions. A given level of the funds rate
can be consistent with easing or tightening monetary conditions, depending on
market expectations about future short-term rates. In part because of the FOMC's
communication strategy, which has linked future rate changes to the levels of
inflation and resource utilization, and in part because of the gradualist
policies that the FOMC has pursued in the past, markets have responded to
recent data on payrolls, spending, and inflation by bringing forward a
considerable amount of future policy tightening into current financial
conditions. Notably, in the past few months, long-term interest rates have
risen 100 basis points or more, equity markets have been subdued despite robust
earnings reports, and the dollar has strengthened. These developments--the
sort of &quot;front-loading&quot; of monetary tightening predicted by our
analysis of gradualism--will reduce the financial impetus being provided to the
economy and thus provide some check to nascent inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>In short, the low level of the
federal funds rate not withstanding, broad monetary conditions have already
begun to normalize, a development that should tend to limit future inflation
risks. Of course, at some point the FOMC will have to validate the general
expectation of rising short-term rates; expectations management is not an
independent tool of monetary policy. The good news is that, because of the
impact of private-sector expectations about policy on current long-term rates,
a significant portion of the financial adjustment associated with the
tightening cycle may already be behind us.

Even this statement is not quite accurate. The
Fed does not set the federal funds rate in an administrative sense but only
controls it indirectly by varying the supply of bank reserves.&nbsp;<a href="#f2">Return to text</a>

See <a href="#reference">Amato and Laubach</a> (1999) for further
discussion. These authors use simulations of a small macroeconomic model to
show that gradualism can improve the Feds ability to affect long-term rates
and thus stabilize the economy.&nbsp;<a href="#f3">Return to text</a>
