  <TR> 
    <TD class="Normal"> <p> I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate 
        in the Bloomberg Panel on the Outlook for the U.S. Economy. When I was 
        a boy in South Carolina, my parents always advised me never to discuss 
        religion or politics in public, those being subjects on which everyone 
        has a strong opinion but on which no one can ever be proved wrong. I have 
        always followed their advice on those particular topics, but I am afraid 
        that economic forecasting may be just about as bad on both counts. Everyone 
        has strong views on where the economy is heading, but when the time finally 
        comes to compare your forecast with the data, the world has changed in 
        eleven unpredictable ways that no one can blame you for failing to foresee--that 
        is, if they remember what you forecast in the first place. 
      <p> Unfortunately, as helping to make monetary policy is part of my current 
        job, I cannot avoid forming some opinions about the outlook for the U.S. 
        and world economies. Today I will give you a few of my impressions about 
        what seems likely to unfold in the next year to eighteen months, as well 
        as what I see as the most important risks to that forecast. I will talk 
        first about output growth and unemployment, and then about inflation, 
        and I will conclude by discussing some implications for monetary policy. 
        Both my prepared remarks and the comments I may make in the discussion 
        later should be clearly understood as reflecting only my own views and 
        not those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
        or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
      <p> <strong>The Forecast through 2004: Growth and Unemployment</strong> 
      <p> To provide some context for this talk, I consulted the prognostications 
        (in August releases) of some prominent private-sector forecasters and 
        surveys of forecasters, namely Global Insight (formerly DRI-WEFA), the 
        Blue Chip Survey, Macroeconomic Advisers, and the Survey of Professional 
        Forecasters (<a href="#table1">see table 1</a>). As you will see, I agree 
        with several aspects of these well-regarded forecasts but (perhaps at 
        my peril) disagree with, or at least have reservations about, some others. 
      <p> Beginning with the real side of the economy, we see in table 1 substantial 
        agreement among the private-sector forecasters about the prospects for 
        real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through the end of 2004. All 
        the forecasters expect output growth during the second half of this year 
        to be strong, in the general range of 3.7 to 4.2 percent. Despite the 
        projections of high growth rates, the private forecasters expect the unemployment 
        rate to remain at about the current rate of 6.2 percent through the end 
        of this year. The private-sector forecasters also see strong economic 
        growth continuing, although generally not accelerating, in 2004. Measuring 
        growth as 2004:Q4 over 2003:Q4, Global Insight forecasts 4.1 percent growth 
        for real GDP in 2004, Blue Chip calls for 3.7 percent growth, Macroeconomic 
        Advisers sees 4.0 percent growth, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters 
        looks for 3.8 percent growth. Notably, according to the professionals, 
        even this performance is not expected to decrease the unemployment rate 
        by very much. Only Macroeconomic Advisers sees unemployment in the fourth 
        quarter of 2004 falling as low as 5.4 percent; the rest foresee the unemployment 
        rate remaining at 5.8 or 5.9 percent during the last quarter of next year. 
      <p> These projections for the paths of growth and unemployment are broadly 
        consistent with forecasts made by the members of the FOMC prior to our 
        June 24-25 meeting and released shortly thereafter as part of the Federal 
        Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. The FOMC 
        members' forecasts for real GDP for 2003 were for growth over the entire 
        year; they were not broken down by quarter. However, given information 
        about the first half available at the time the Committee's forecasts were 
        made, the central-tendency FOMC forecast for real GDP growth for the year 
        as a whole almost certainly implies a noticeable pickup in the pace of 
        expansion in the second half of 2003. For 2004, the central-tendency FOMC 
        projection for real GDP growth as of the end of June covered the range 
        of 3-3/4 percent to 4-3/4 percent, a forecast more optimistic than even 
        current private-sector forecasts of growth for next year and suggestive 
        of an acceleration in real activity from the second half of 2003 to 2004. 
      <p> The central tendency of FOMC forecasts for the unemployment rate, as 
        of the end of this past June, called for the rate to fall to between 6 
        and 6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and to decline to 
        between 5-1/2 and 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Again, these 
        values are broadly consistent with the more recent private-sector forecasts. 
        In particular, the private-sector forecasters and FOMC members evidently 
        agree that strong GDP growth will only gradually erode the accumulated 
        slack in the job market. Simple arithmetic tells us that all the forecasters 
        are expecting much of the projected increase in output to be met by ongoing 
        increases in labor productivity, rather than by substantial new hiring. 
        This point is a crucial one, to which I will return later when discussing 
        inflation projections. 
      <p> I should tip my hand at this point and say that I personally find the 
        real growth and unemployment forecasts just described to be broadly reasonable, 
        though there are important risks. In particular, I have been of the view 
        for quite a while that acceleration of growth to 4 percent or better in 
        2004 is plausible; and I agree also that the decline in the unemployment 
        rate, though steady, is likely to be slow. 
      <p> Why do I believe that there are grounds for optimism about economic 
        growth, even as more caution is warranted regarding unemployment? The 
        consumer plays a central role as always, and recent news on retail sales 
        (including automobile sales) and housing starts and sales, among other 
        data, suggests that household spending continues to hold up well, as it 
        has throughout the past three years. Tax cuts, signs of stabilization 
        in the job market, and rising stock prices are among the factors that 
        should keep the consumer in the game as the recovery proceeds. What makes 
        the situation today feel particularly encouraging, however, is that we 
        may finally be seeing some signs of a revival in business investment. 
        Because I see the strength and sustainability of that revival as the key 
        to the forecast, I would like to discuss it in a bit more detail. 
      <p> In a speech I gave to the Forecasters' Club last April (Bernanke, 2003a), 
        entitled "Will Business Investment Bounce Back?," I pointed out that the 
        recession that began in March 2001 is distinctive in being one of the 
        few business-led--as opposed to household-led--recessions of the post-World 
        War II period. In particular, a sharp decline in business investment spending 
        that began in the second half of 2000 was the proximate cause of the recession. 
        By the same token, I argued in my earlier speech--making a point that 
        many others have made as well--that a balanced recovery would be impossible 
        without a sustained revival in capital expenditures. My earlier speech 
        surveyed the prospects for various types of investment spending but emphasized 
        the importance for the strength of the investment recovery of CEOs' views 
        on prospective returns to capital expenditure and the future of the economy--their 
        animal spirits, if you will. 
      <p> With a little more than four additional months' worth of data, what 
        can we say today about the recovery of investment spending? As I noted 
        in April, the best prospects for an investment rebound in the corporate 
        sector lie in the equipment and software sector, particularly in high-tech 
        equipment. Over the summer we have seen indications of at least a moderate 
        pickup in this sector. Notably, according to the preliminary GDP estimates, 
        real investment in equipment and software rose at an annual rate of 8 
        percent in the second quarter. Real expenditures for high-tech equipment 
        advanced 34 percent (at an annual rate) in the second quarter, a significant 
        step up from the first quarter, and real spending on software rose at 
        a 9 percent rate. Perhaps managers have finally decided that they can't 
        put off that IT upgrade any longer. Even spending on communications equipment 
        was strong in the second quarter. Investment in non-high-tech equipment, 
        including both transportation and general machinery, has also improved. 
        In recent months, indicators such as orders data and indexes based on 
        surveys of managers' plans for capital expenditures have strengthened, 
        on balance, suggesting that investment in equipment and software is likely 
        to continue to rise in the near term. 
      <p> By contrast, as I noted in my earlier speech and others have observed, 
        investment in nonresidential structures is not a promising source of growth. 
        The strength in this category in the second quarter was due importantly 
        to an increase in spending in the drilling and mining sector, tied primarily 
        to high natural gas prices. The outlook for buildings, particularly office 
        and industrial buildings, remains weak, as high vacancy rates and low 
        utilization rates persist. However, for better or worse, investment in 
        nonresidential structures has become such a small part of aggregate spending 
        on average that recovery in this sector is not a make-or-break factor 
        for the overall economy. 
      <p> Looking beyond the very near term, I see some grounds for optimism that 
        the revival in business investment will persist, laying the foundation 
        for continuing rapid expansion in 2004. First, the strong growth in demand 
        already in train should provide incentives to corporate managers to expand 
        productive capacity, particularly given the efforts that they have already 
        made to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of production within 
        existing plants. In that regard, I think it is worth pointing out that 
        firms have been meeting demand recently not only by getting greater productivity 
        out of their existing capital and labor resources but also by running 
        down inventory stocks relative to sales. If the past is a guide, we may 
        soon see a quarter or two of inventory building that provides a powerful 
        boost to the growth rate of output. 
      <p> Second, financial conditions remain favorable to business investment. 
        Profits are rising smartly, and corporations have considerably improved 
        their balance sheets. Although corporate bond rates have risen in the 
        past few months, they remain low by historical standards, and spreads 
        have continued to come down. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, and 
        eager to lend to business borrowers. In short, both internal funding and 
        external finance for investment are available. Third, tax provisions passed 
        in 2001 and 2003 lower the effective cost of investing in new equipment. 
        Finally, as best as we can tell, expectations and attitudes in the business 
        community--as reflected in surveys, information from business contacts, 
        analysts' expectations of long-term earnings growth, and the like--have 
        brightened somewhat. When all these factors are taken together, it seems 
        a reasonable bet that the revival in capital expenditures will continue 
        and will strengthen sufficiently to support the optimistic growth forecasts 
        that I discussed earlier. 
      <p> As the prospective investment revival is central to the optimistic growth 
        forecast, however, it is also the locus of the most critical risks to 
        the forecast. For some time now, CEOs have displayed a greater reluctance 
        to invest and hire than standard econometric models predict. Commentators 
        have given this negative residual many names: the workout of post-bubble 
        excesses, geopolitical uncertainty, the reaction to the accounting scandals 
        of 2002, and self-fulfilling pessimism. Personally, I admit that I don't 
        fully understand the sources of this conservative behavior on the part 
        of company management, and for that reason, I cannot be entirely confident 
        that caution will not continue to predominate in the executive suite. 
        A weaker investment trajectory reflecting continued CEO caution would 
        probably not derail the current recovery, but it would certainly put the 
        more-optimistic growth projections for 2004 out of reach and would substantially 
        slow the absorption of unemployed resources. 
      <p> I have not mentioned the trade sector. Net exports have been a drag 
        on U.S. growth; indeed, in the second quarter, net exports deducted (in 
        an arithmetic sense) a hefty 1-1/2 percentage points from U.S. real GDP 
        growth. My sense is that the optimistic growth forecasts for the United 
        States for the next year do not rely on anything more than a modest increase 
        in growth in the rest of the world. Of course, to the extent that unanticipated 
        strength abroad materializes and raises demand for U.S. exports, the outlook 
        here will improve further. 
      <p> Finally, a word on long-term interest rates, which as you know have 
        been rising. At current levels, bond yields do not pose a major risk to 
        continuing strength in housing or the recovery in corporate investment, 
        in my view, though they may well end the boom in mortgage refinancing 
        activity. Since those consumers who had the most to gain from refinancing 
        have mostly already done so, a slowdown in refinancing is unlikely to 
        have a significant effect on household spending. 
      <p> <strong>The Forecast through 2004: Inflation</strong> 
      <p> I turn now from the forecast for real activity to the outlook for inflation. 
        As before, I will both compare the various published projections and talk 
        about some risks to the forecast. 
      <p> Inflation has been quite low, of course, and the private-sector forecasters 
        expect inflation to remain low for the rest of this year and next. As 
        table 1 shows, forecasts for CPI inflation for the second half of 2003 
        (the average of third- and fourth-quarter inflation forecasts, at an annual 
        rate) by Global Insight, Blue Chip, Macroeconomic Advisers, and the Survey 
        of Professional Forecasters are tightly clustered in a range of approximately 
        1-1/4 percent to 1-1/2 percent. (I will not comment here on forecasts 
        for inflation as measured by the GDP price index, also shown in table 
        1, other than to say, as you can see for yourselves, that they are also 
        quite low.) The same four sources report CPI inflation forecasts for 2004, 
        fourth quarter over fourth quarter, of between 1-1/4 and 2 percent. 
      <p> For monetary policy purposes, one is often interested in measures of 
        underlying inflation. One such measure is so-called core CPI inflation, 
        defined as the rate of change of the consumer price index excluding food 
        and energy prices, which tend to be relatively volatile. I was able to 
        find a core CPI inflation forecast only for Macroeconomic Advisers. Macroeconomic 
        Advisers expects core CPI inflation for 2004 to be 1.5 percent, compared 
        with an expectation of 1.3 percent for overall CPI inflation. If Macroeconomic 
        Advisers is representative, then the distinction between core and overall 
        CPI inflation is not of first-order importance for next year's inflation 
        forecast. As best as I can tell, the same should be roughly true for inflation 
        forecasts for the second half of 2003, though not for 2003 as a whole 
        (the third column of the table) because of the sharp increases in energy 
        prices in the first quarter of this year. 
      <p> For comparison with the private-sector forecasts, the FOMC's central-tendency 
        forecast at the end of June was that inflation in 2004 will range between 
        1 and 1-1/2 percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures 
        (PCE) chain-type price index. Because of differences in the construction 
        of this index and the CPI, an upward adjustment of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage 
        point is probably necessary to make PCE inflation comparable to CPI inflation. 
        Hence the FOMC central-tendency forecast for inflation for 2004 is also 
        broadly consistent with the private-sector estimates. 
      <p> One can try to assess the validity of these forecasts in two ways. For 
        the short run, a couple of quarters, looking in some detail at the components 
        of price indexes, to try to isolate trends and special factors, is useful. 
        For the longer run, there is no substitute for thinking hard about the 
        underlying economic factors influencing inflation. 
      <p> Consideration of the details of the price indexes suggests that the 
        rather marked deceleration we recently saw in core inflation measures 
        has come to a halt for now, and indeed, that core inflation may tick up 
        a few tenths during the remainder of 2003. The reasons are largely technical. 
        Probably the most important factor, quantitatively speaking, has to do 
        with the way that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates owners' 
        equivalent rent (OER), an estimate of the cost of living in one's own 
        home. Data on market rental rates for homes and apartments are important 
        inputs into the calculation of OER. Because rental leases often include 
        landlord-provided utilities, the BLS subtracts estimates of the costs 
        of utilities from market quotes of gross rents to obtain estimates of 
        rents net of utilities. However, to the extent that, in the short run, 
        landlords do not fully pass on changes in utility costs to renters, the 
        BLS adjustment is an over-correction. In particular, in periods when energy 
        prices and hence utility costs are rising, as in the first half of 2003, 
        the BLS procedure may overstate the deceleration in rents net of utilities 
        and hence in owners' equivalent rent. As a result, on this particular 
        count, the slowdown in CPI inflation may have been slightly overstated 
        in the first half of 2003. If so, the stabilization in residential energy 
        costs in the second half of 2003 should unwind this effect and likely 
        add a bit to measured inflation going forward. 
      <p> Another example of a special factor affecting measured inflation arises 
        from the fiscal problems of state and local governments: To cover rising 
        budget deficits, a number of public university systems have announced 
        large tuition price hikes for the upcoming academic year. These tuition 
        hikes will naturally affect the measured cost of living. As one-time events 
        that are more fiscal than monetary in nature, however, I do not consider 
        them particularly important from a monetary policy point of view. A similar 
        effect was seen in the increase in the July CPI number, which was partly 
        attributable to a rise in tobacco excise taxes imposed by a number of 
        states. Other examples arise because of lags in data collection: For example, 
        telephone rates are incorporated into the CPI only with some lag, so that 
        rate increases that occurred earlier this year will not be reflected in 
        the index for a few months yet. I alert you to some of these special cases 
        only to illustrate why the Federal Reserve does not react to month-to-month 
        changes in inflation data, or any other series for that matter. 
      <p> For assessing the inflation forecast for the longer run, in this case 
        the year 2004, one has to turn to the underlying economics. I do not disagree 
        with the general tenor of the private-sector forecasts and the FOMC projections. 
        It seems plausible that the combination of a strengthening recovery, well-anchored 
        inflation expectations, and a monetary authority strongly committed to 
        stabilizing inflation will serve to keep inflation in the projected range. 
        However, in my view, the most likely outcomes are in the lower part of 
        that range, and I believe that the risks remain to the downside. The reason 
        is that ongoing productivity growth, together with stepped-up capital 
        investment, may enable producers to meet expanding demand without substantially 
        increased hiring in the near term, with the result that labor markets 
        remain soft. Indeed, as I have noted, several of the private-sector forecasters 
        project unemployment rates still near 6 percent in the fourth quarter 
        of 2004, despite real growth approaching 4 percent for the second half 
        of 2003 and all of 2004. By a standard textbook calculation (Bernanke, 
        2003b), this amount of slack should lead to additional disinflation of 
        a few tenths of a percentage point or so by the end of 2004. So by my 
        reckoning, inflation in 2004 might well be a bit lower than in the second 
        half of 2003, not higher as the majority of private-sector forecasters 
        have projected. Of course, if real growth were to disappoint--for example, 
        because the investment rebound in 2004 was less strong than is hoped for 
        and expected--the disinflationary pressures would be all the stronger. 
      <p> Caveats abound, of course. As I have already noted, for various reasons 
        including some special technical factors, core CPI inflation is likely 
        to tick up during the remainder of 2003. It is always possible that employment 
        may rebound more quickly than we now expect. And, as history tells us, 
        inflation forecasts only two to five quarters out have large standard 
        errors, so that a wide range of inflation outcomes are possible for 2004. 
        Nevertheless, for now it seems to me that, with inflation already low, 
        disinflation risk will remain a concern for some time. 
      <p> <strong>Implications for Monetary Policy</strong> 
      <p> Let me turn then to the implications for monetary policy. Given these 
        forecasts, how should the Federal Reserve be expected to respond? 
      <p> Since May 6, the Federal Open Market Committee has assessed the risks 
        separately for the two main components of its mandate, economic growth 
        and inflation. According to the statement that followed our August meeting, 
        the FOMC views the risks to sustainable growth as being roughly balanced. 
        However the risks to inflation, according to the statement, are tilted 
        downward, with the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation outweighing 
        the probability of an increase in inflation. As I see it, the persistence 
        of economic slack even as growth picks up makes it likely that inflation 
        will remain low and in some scenarios may fall still further. 
      <p> As the statement concluded, "the Committee believes that policy accommodation 
        can be maintained for a considerable period." How long is "a considerable 
        period"? The right answer, I think, is that "a considerable period" is 
        not a fixed stretch of time but depends on the evolution of the economy. 
        In particular, in my view, the Federal Open Market Committee has little 
        reason to undertake significant tightening so long as inflation remains 
        low and promises to remain subdued, as it does today. 
      <p> Let me elaborate. In the past, significantly tighter monetary policy 
        often came shortly after the beginning of a cyclical pickup in economic 
        growth. When Fed policymakers responded that way, they did so as the consequence 
        of living in a regime in which inflation was already above the desired 
        range, and the rapid acceleration of activity threatened to press against 
        capacity and raise inflation still higher. Then the risk to satisfactory 
        economic performance was that inflation would rise too high, and policy 
        was forced to preempt that risk. Today inflation is at the lower end of 
        the range consistent with optimum economic performance, and soft labor 
        markets and excess capacity create a further downward risk to inflation. 
        As a result, I believe that increased economic growth may not elicit the 
        same response from the Fed that it has sometimes elicited in the past. 
      <p> Besides the fact that inflation is currently at the low end of the desirable 
        range, there is a second reason why the Fed may not respond as it has 
        in the past to a pickup in economic growth. As you know, we have seen 
        in the past few years a truly remarkable increase in labor productivity, 
        sufficient to permit growth in output even as employment has fallen. Output 
        growth arising from higher productivity is not typically accompanied by 
        increased inflationary pressures. Indeed, I would argue that, in situations 
        of considerable slack, growth that is generated solely by increased productivity, 
        and that is unaccompanied by substantial employment growth, may possibly 
        require monetary ease, rather than monetary tightening, in the short run. 
      <p> I should emphasize that, though current circumstances should permit 
        the Federal Reserve to accommodate a considerable period of above-trend 
        growth, this does not in my view imply an increased tolerance for inflation. 
        The FOMC has made clear in its new statement, as introduced after the 
        May 6 meeting, that it has an acceptable range for inflation, consistent 
        with its mandate for maintaining price stability. The current policy of 
        ease results from concerns that inflation will fall below that acceptable 
        range. But at some point in the future, disinflationary forces will abate, 
        and the risks to inflation may turn upwards. At that point I expect that 
        the FOMC will act forcefully to ensure that inflation remains low and 
        stable. 
      <p> Let me close by restating and summarizing the three main conclusions 
        of these forecasts for monetary policy. First, a "considerable period 
        of time" is not a fixed period of time but depends on the evolution of 
        the economy. In my view, the Fed has no reason to undertake a significant 
        tightening of policy so long as inflation is low and inflation pressures 
        remain subdued. Second, productivity-led growth that does not raise the 
        underlying rate of resource utilization does not increase inflationary 
        pressures and thus, in my view, should not prompt a policy tightening. 
        Finally, the Fed's current policy of resisting a fall of inflation below 
        its implicit zone for price stability does not, in my opinion, signal 
        a new dovishness with respect to inflation in general. I expect the Fed 
        to be just as tough in resisting unwanted upward movements in inflation 
        as it currently is in resisting undesired declines.
