      D.C.<br>
      April 27, 2004 </strong> 
      <p>
	  <p>The dramatic rise in six-year forward futures prices for crude oil and 
        natural gas over the past few years has received relatively little attention 
        for an economic event that can significantly affect the long-term path 
        of the U.S. economy. Six years is a period long enough to seek, discover, 
        drill, and lift oil and gas, and hence futures prices at that horizon 
        can be viewed as effective long-term supply prices. </p>
      <p>These elevated long-term prices, if sustained, could alter the magnitude 
        of and manner in which the United States consumes energy. Until recently, 
        long-term expectations of oil and gas prices appeared benign. When choosing 
        capital projects, businesses could mostly look through short-run fluctuations 
        in prices to moderate prices over the longer haul. The recent shift in 
        expectations, however, has been substantial enough and persistent enough 
        to influence business investment decisions, especially for facilities 
        that require large quantities of natural gas. Although the effect of these 
        developments on energy-related investments is significant, it doubtless 
        will fall far short of the large changes in our capital stock that followed 
        the 1970s surge in crude oil prices. </p>
      <p>The energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced by 
        almost half since the early 1970s. Much of the energy displacement occurred 
        by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil. Progress 
        in reducing energy intensity has continued since then, but at a lessened 
        pace. This more-modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally 
        lower level of real oil and natural gas prices that prevailed between 
        1985 and 2000 and that carried over into electric power prices. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p>The production side of the oil and gas markets also has changed dramatically 
        over the past decade. Technological changes taking place are likely to 
        make existing energy reserves stretch further and to keep long-term energy 
        costs lower than they otherwise would have been. Seismic techniques and 
        satellite imaging, which are facilitating the discovery of promising new 
        reservoirs of crude oil and natural gas worldwide, have nearly doubled 
        the success rate of new-field wildcat wells in the United States during 
        the past decade. New techniques allow far deeper drilling of promising 
        fields, especially offshore. The newer innovations in recovery are reported 
        to have increased significantly the average proportion of oil and, to 
        a lesser extent, gas reserves eventually brought to the surface. </p>
      <p>One might expect that, as a consequence of what has been a dramatic shift 
        from the hit-or-miss wildcat oil and gas exploration and development of 
        the past to more-advanced technologies, the cost of developing new fields 
        and, hence, the long-term supply price of new oil and gas would have declined. 
        And, indeed, these costs have declined, but by less than might otherwise 
        have been the case. Much of the innovation in oil development outside 
        OPEC, for example, has been directed at overcoming an increasingly inhospitable 
        and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more than a century 
        of draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil. </p>
      <p>Still, distant futures prices for crude oil moved lower, on net, during 
        the 1990s as a result of declining long-term marginal costs of extraction. 
        The most-distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel 
        just before the first Gulf War to $16 to $18 a barrel in 1999. Distant 
        futures for natural gas, which were less than $2 per million Btu at the 
        time of the first Gulf War drifted up to $2.50 per million Btu by 1999, 
        although those prices remained below the prices of oil on an equivalent 
        Btu basis. </p>
      <p>Such long-term price tranquility has faded noticeably over the past four 
        years. Between 1990 and 2000, although spot prices ranged between $11 
        and $35 per barrel, distant futures exhibited little variation. Currently 
        prices for delivery in 2010 of light sweet crude, roughly equal to West 
        Texas intermediate, have risen to more than $27 per barrel. A similar 
        pattern is evident in natural gas. Even the spikes in the spot price in 
        2000 had only a temporary effect on distant natural gas futures prices. 
        That situation changed in 2001, however, when the distant futures prices 
        for gas delivery at the Henry Hub began a rise from $3.20 per million 
        Btu to almost $5 today. </p>
      <p>The reasons for the sharp increases in both crude and gas distant futures 
        prices seem reasonably straightforward, though they differ in important 
        respects. The strength of crude oil prices presumably reflects fears of 
        long-term supply disruptions in the Middle East that have resulted in 
        an increase in risk premiums being added to the cost of capital. Although 
        there are competitive spillovers from the higher price of oil, the causes 
        of the rise in the long-term supply price of natural gas appear related 
        primarily to supply and demand in North America. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p> Today's tight natural gas markets have been a long time in coming. Little 
        more than a half-century ago, drillers seeking valuable crude oil bemoaned 
        the discovery of natural gas. Given the lack of adequate transportation, 
        wells had to be capped or the gas flared. As the U.S. economy expanded 
        after World War II, the development of a vast interstate transmission 
        system facilitated widespread consumption of natural gas in our homes 
        and business establishments. By 1970, natural gas consumption, on a heat-equivalent 
        basis, had risen to three-fourths that of oil. But in the following decade 
        consumption lagged because of competitive inroads made by coal and nuclear 
        power. Since 1985, natural gas has gradually increased its share in total 
        energy use and, owing to its status as a clean-burning fuel, is projected 
        by the Energy Information Administration of the United States to maintain 
        that higher share over the next quarter century. </p>
      <p>Dramatic changes in technology in recent years, while making existing 
        natural gas reserves stretch further, have been unable, in the face of 
        inexorably rising demand, to keep the underlying long-term price for natural 
        gas in the United States from rising. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p> Over the past few decades, short-term movements in domestic prices in 
        the markets for crude oil have been determined largely by international 
        market participants, especially OPEC. But that was not always the case. 
      </p>
      <p>In the early years of oil development, pricing power was firmly in the 
        hands of Americans, predominately John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. 
        Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices in the early 
        years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller endeavored with some success 
        to control those prices. After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing 
        power remained with the United States--first with the U.S. oil companies 
        and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised allowable output 
        to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp declines. Indeed, 
        as late as 1952 U.S. crude oil production still accounted for more than 
        half of the world total. However, that historical role came to an end 
        in 1971, when excess capacity in the United States was finally absorbed 
        by rising demand. </p>
      <p>At that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been 
        resident on the gulf coast of Texas, moved to the Persian Gulf. To capitalize 
        on their newly acquired pricing power, many producing nations in the Middle 
        East nationalized their oil companies. But the full magnitude of their 
        pricing power became evident only in the aftermath of the oil embargo 
        of 1973. During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura rose 
        to more than $11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per barrel 
        that had been unchanged from 1961 to 1970. </p>
      <p>The sharp price increases of the early 1970s brought to an abrupt end 
        the extraordinary period of growth in U.S. oil consumption and the increased 
        intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades immediately following 
        World War II. Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of oil products rose 
        at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth 
        of real gross domestic product. However, since 1973, oil consumption has 
        grown, on average, only 1/2 percent per year, far short of the rise in 
        real GDP.</p>
      <p> Although OPEC production quotas have been a significant factor in price 
        determination for a third of a century, the story since 1973 has been 
        as much one of the power of markets as of power over markets. The signals 
        provided by market prices have eventually resolved even the most seemingly 
        insurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply in the United 
        States. The gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 
        period was feared by many to be so large that rationing would be the only 
        practical solution. </p>
      <p>But the resolution did not occur quite that way. To be sure, mandated 
        fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks accompanied slower 
        growth of gasoline demand. Some observers argue, however, that, even without 
        government-enforced standards, market forces would have produced increased 
        fuel efficiency. Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese 
        cars that were imported into the United States markets grew significantly 
        in the late 1970s after the Iranian Revolution drove up crude oil prices 
        to nearly $40 per barrel. </p>
      <p>Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher. Projections 
        of $50 per barrel or more were widely prevalent. Our Department of Energy 
        had baseline projections showing prices reaching $60 per barrel--the equivalent 
        of more than twice that in today's prices. </p>
      <p>The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a 
        testament to the power of markets and the technologies they foster. Today, 
        despite its recent surge, the price of crude oil in real terms is only 
        half of what it was in December 1979. </p>
      <p>As I indicated earlier, the rise in six-year oil and gas futures prices 
        is almost surely going to affect the growth of oil and gas consumption 
        in the United States and the nature of the capital stock investments currently 
        under contemplation. However, the responses are likely to differ somewhat 
        between plans for oil and those for gas usage. </p>
      <p>OPEC, the source of greatest supply flexibility, has endeavored to calibrate 
        crude oil liftings to price. They fear that significant supply excesses 
        will drive down prices and revenues, whereas too low a level of output 
        will elevate prices to a point that will induce long-term reductions in 
        demand for oil and in the associated long-term revenues to be earned from 
        oil. </p>
      <p>Natural gas pricing, on the other hand, is inherently far more volatile 
        than oil, doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed, price-damping 
        global trade. Because gas is particularly challenging to transport in 
        its cryogenic form as a liquid, imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
        into the United States to date have been negligible, accounting for only 
        2 percent of U.S. gas supply in 2003. Environmental and safety concerns 
        and cost considerations have limited the number of terminals available 
        for importing LNG. Canada, which has recently supplied a sixth of our 
        consumption, has little capacity to significantly expand its exports, 
        in part because of the role that Canadian gas plays in supporting growing 
        oil production from tar sands. </p>
      <p>Given notable cost reductions for both liquefaction and transportation 
        of LNG, significant global trade is developing. And high natural gas prices 
        projected by distant futures prices have made imported gas a more attractive 
        option for us. According to the tabulations of BP, worldwide imports of 
        natural gas in 2002 were only 23 percent of world consumption, compared 
        with 57 percent for oil. Clearly, the gas trade has a long way to go. 
      </p>
      <p>The gap in the behaviors of the markets for oil and for natural gas is 
        readily observable. The prices of crude oil and products are subject to 
        much price arbitrage, which has the effect of encouraging the transportation 
        of supplies from areas of relative surplus to those of relative shortage 
        and of thereby containing local price spikes. This effect was most vividly 
        demonstrated in 2003, when Venezuelan oil production was essentially shut 
        down. American refiners with unlimited access to world supplies were able 
        to replace lost oil with diversions from Europe, Asia, and the Middle 
        East. </p>
      <p>If North American natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility 
        exhibited by oil, more extensive access to the vast world reserves of 
        gas is required. Markets need to be able to adjust effectively to unexpected 
        shortfalls in domestic supply in the same way that they do in oil. Access 
        to world natural gas supplies will require a major expansion of LNG terminal 
        import capacity and the development of the newer offshore re-gasification 
        technologies. Without the flexibility such facilities impart, imbalances 
        in supply and demand must inevitably engender price volatility. </p>
      <p>As the technology of LNG liquefaction and shipping has improved and as 
        safety considerations have lessened, a major expansion of U.S. import 
        capability appears to be under way. These movements bode well for widespread 
        natural gas availability in North America in the next decade and beyond. 
        The near term, however, is apt to continue to be challenging. </p>
