      <p> As the Great Depression of the 1930s deepened, John Maynard Keynes offered 
        an explanation for the then-bewildering series of events that was to engage 
        economists for generations to come. Market systems, he argued, contrary 
        to the conventional wisdom, did not at all times converge to full employment. 
        They often, in economists' jargon, found equilibrium with significant 
        segments of the workforce unable to find jobs. His insight rested largely 
        on certain perceived rigidities in labor and product markets. The notion 
        prevalent in the 1920s and earlier--that economies, when confronted with 
        unanticipated shocks, would quickly return to full employment--fell into 
        disrepute as the depression festered. In its place arose the view that 
        government action was required to restore full employment. </p>
      <p>More broadly, government intervention was increasingly seen as necessary 
        to correct the failures and deficiencies viewed as inherent in market 
        economies. Laissez-faire was rapidly abandoned and a tidal wave of regulation 
        swept over much of the world's business community. In the United States, 
        labor practices, securities issuance, banking, agricultural pricing, and 
        many other segments of the American economy, fell under the oversight 
        of government. With the onset of World War II, both the U.S. and the U.K. 
        economies went on a regimented war footing. Military production ramped 
        up rapidly and output reached impressive levels. Central planning, in 
        one sense, had its finest hour. The pattern of production and distribution 
        depended on plans devised by a small, elite group rather than responding 
        to the myriad choices of consumers that rule a market economy. </p>
      <p>The ostensible success of wartime economies operating at full employment, 
        in contrast to the earlier frightening developments of the depression 
        years, thwarted a full dismantlement of wartime regimens when hostilities 
        came to an end. Wage and price controls, coupled with rationing, lingered 
        in many economies well into the first postwar decade. Because full employment 
        was no longer perceived as ensured by the marketplace, government initiatives 
        promoting job growth dominated the postwar economic policy framework of 
        the Western democracies. In the United States, the Congress passed, and 
        the President signed, the "Employment Act of 1946." </p>
      <p>However, cracks in the facade of government economic management emerged 
        early in the postwar years, and those cracks were to continue widening 
        as time passed. Britain's heavily controlled economy was under persistent 
        stress as it vaulted from one crisis to another in the early postwar decades. 
        In the United States, unbalanced macroeconomic policies led to a gradual 
        uptrend in the rate of inflation in the 1960s. The imposition of wage 
        and price controls in the 1970s to deal with the problem of inflation 
        proved unworkable and ineffective. The notion that the centrally planned 
        Soviet economy was catching up with the West was, by the early 1980s, 
        increasingly viewed as dubious, though it was not fully discarded until 
        the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 exposing the economic ruin behind 
        the iron curtain. </p>
      <p>The East-West divisions following World War II engendered an unintended 
        four-decades-long experiment in comparative economic systems, which led, 
        in the end, to a judgment by the vast majority of policymakers that market 
        economies were unequivocally superior to those managed by central planning. 
        Many developing nations abandoned their Soviet-type economic systems for 
        more market-based regimes. </p>
      <p>But even earlier in the developed world, distortions induced by regulation 
        were more and more disturbing. In response, starting in the 1970s, American 
        Presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities in the Congress, deregulated 
        large segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and financial 
        services industries. The stated purpose was to enhance competition, which 
        was increasingly seen as a significant spur to productivity growth and 
        elevated standards of living. Assisting in the dismantling of economic 
        rigidities was the seemingly glacial, but persistent, lowering of barriers 
        to cross-border trade and finance. </p>
      <p>As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once great 
        economic power that had lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront 
        of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called "creative 
        destruction," the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way 
        for the innovative. In that paradigm, standards of living rise because 
        depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly 
        obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance 
        the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge 
        technologies. Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital. </p>
      <p>Through this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental 
        step, as high levels of productivity associated with innovative technologies 
        displace lesser productive capabilities. The model presupposes the continuous 
        churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new displaces 
        the old. </p>
      <p>The success of that strategy in the United States confirmed, by the 1980s, 
        the earlier views that a loosening of regulatory restraint on business 
        would improve the flexibility of our economy. Flexibility implies a faster 
        response to shocks and a correspondingly greater ability to absorb their 
        downside consequences and to recover from their aftermath. No specific 
        program encompassed and coordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, 
        but there was a growing recognition, both in the United States and among 
        many of our trading partners, that a market economy could best withstand 
        and recover from shocks when provided maximum flexibility. </p>
      <p>Developments that enhanced flexibility ranged far beyond regulatory or 
        statutory change. For example, employers have long been able to legally 
        discharge employees at modest cost. But in the early postwar years, profitable 
        large corporations were dissuaded from wholesale job reduction. Contractual 
        inhibitions, to be sure, were then decidedly more prevalent than today, 
        but of far greater importance, our culture in the aftermath of depression 
        frowned on such action. Only when bankruptcy threatened was it perceived 
        to be acceptable. </p>
      <p>But as the depression receded into history, attitudes toward job security 
        and tenure changed. The change was first evidenced by the eventual acceptance 
        by the American public of President Reagan's discharge of federally employed 
        air traffic controllers in 1981 when they engaged in an illegal strike. 
        Job security, not a major concern of the average worker in earlier years, 
        became a significant issue especially in labor negotiations. By the early 
        1990s, the climate had so changed that laying off workers to facilitate 
        cost reduction had become a prevalent practice. Whether this seeming greater 
        capacity to discharge workers would increase or decrease the level of 
        structural unemployment was uncertain, however. In the event, structural 
        unemployment decreased because the broadened freedom to discharge workers 
        rendered hiring them less of a potentially costly long-term commitment. 
      </p>
      <p>The increased flexibility of our labor market is now judged an important 
        contributor to economic resilience and growth. American workers, to a 
        large extent, see this connection and, despite the evident tradeoff between 
        flexibility and job security, have not opposed innovation. An appreciation 
        of the benefits of flexibility also has been growing elsewhere. Germany 
        recently passed labor reforms, as have other continental European nations. 
        U.K. labor markets, of course, have also experienced significant increases 
        in flexibility in recent years. </p>
      <p>Beyond deregulation and culture change, innovative technologies, especially 
        information technology, have been major contributors to enhanced flexibility. 
        A quarter-century ago, companies often required weeks to unearth a possible 
        inventory imbalance, allowing production to continue to exacerbate the 
        excess. Excessive inventories, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline 
        in output for a time than would have been necessary had the knowledge 
        of their status been fully current. The advent of innovative information 
        technologies has significantly foreshortened the reporting lag, enabling 
        flexible real-time responses to emerging imbalances. </p>
      <p>Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the 
        United States and elsewhere, to advance <em>financial</em> flexibility, 
        which in the end may be the most important contributor to the evident 
        significant gains in economic stability over the past two decades. </p>
      <p>Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, 
        in part because their ability to leverage offered an efficient source 
        of funding. But too often in periods of severe financial stress, such 
        leverage brought down numerous, previously vaunted banking institutions, 
        and precipitated a financial crisis that led to recession or worse. But 
        recent regulatory reform coupled with innovative technologies has spawned 
        rapidly growing markets for, among many other products, asset-backed securities, 
        collateral loan obligations, and credit derivative default swaps. </p>
      <p>Financial derivatives, more generally, have grown throughout the world 
        at a phenomenal rate of 17 percent per year over the past decade. Conceptual 
        advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along 
        with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have 
        significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for,
        hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. The 
        new instruments of risk dispersion have enabled the largest and most sophisticated 
        banks in their credit-granting role to divest themselves of much credit 
        risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, 
        especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds continue 
        to be willing, at a price, to supply this credit protection, despite the 
        significant losses on such products that some of these investors experienced 
        during the past three years. </p>
      <p>These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed, especially 
        over the recent stressful period, to the development of a far more flexible, 
        efficient, and hence resilient financial system than existed just a quarter-century 
        ago. One prominent example was the response of financial markets to a 
        burgeoning and then deflating telecommunications sector. Worldwide borrowing 
        by telecommunications firms in all currencies amounted to more than the 
        equivalent of one trillion U.S. dollars during the years 1998 to 2001. 
        The financing of the massive expansion of fiber-optic networks and heavy 
        investments in third-generation mobile-phone licenses by European firms 
        strained debt markets. </p>
      <p>At the time, the financing of these investments was widely seen as prudent 
        because the telecommunications borrowers had very high valuations in equity 
        markets, which could facilitate a stock issuance, if needed, to pay down 
        bank loans and other debt. In the event, of course, prices of telecommunications 
        stocks collapsed, and many firms went bankrupt. Write-downs were heavy, 
        especially in continental Europe, but unlike in previous periods of large 
        financial distress, no major financial institution defaulted, and the 
        world economy was not threatened. Thus, in stark contrast to many previous 
        episodes, the global financial system exhibited a remarkable ability to 
        absorb and recover from shocks. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>* * *</strong></p>
      <p>The most significant lesson to be learned from recent economic history 
        is arguably the importance of structural flexibility and the resilience 
        to economic shocks that it imparts. The more flexible an economy, the 
        greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated, 
        disturbances and thus to contain the size and consequences of cyclical 
        imbalances. Enhanced flexibility has the advantage of being able to adjust 
        automatically and not having to rest on policymakers' initiatives, which 
        often come too late or are misguided. </p>
      <p>I do not claim to be able to judge the relative importance of conventional 
        stimulus and increased economic flexibility to our ability to weather 
        the shocks of the past few years. But it is difficult to dismiss improved 
        flexibility as having played a key role in the U.S. economy's recent relative 
        stability. In fact, the past two recessions in the United States were 
        the mildest in the postwar period. The experience of Britain and many 
        others during this period of time have been similar. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>* * *</strong></p>
      <p> I do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in 
        an environment that was less stressful and less competitive than the one 
        with which we currently engage. The cries of distress amply demonstrate 
        that flexibility and its consequence, rigorous competition, are not universally 
        embraced. Flexibility in labor policies, for example, appears in some 
        contexts to be the antithesis of job security. Yet, in our roles as consumers, 
        we seem to insist on the low product prices and high quality that are 
        the most prominent features of our current frenetic economic structure. 
        If a producer can offer quality at a lower price than the competition, 
        retailers are pressed to respond because the consumer will otherwise choose 
        a shopkeeper who does. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product 
        sourcing and will seek out low-cost producers, whether they are located 
        in Guangdong province in China or northern England. </p>
      <p>If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers 
        of capital equipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive 
        paradigm a step further and applied it on a global scale. </p>
      <p>From an economic perspective, the globe has indeed shrunk. Not only have 
        the costs of transporting goods and services, relative to the total value 
        of trade, declined over most of the postwar period, but international 
        travel costs, relative to incomes, are down, and cross-border communications 
        capabilities have risen dramatically with the introduction of the Internet 
        and the use of satellites. National boundaries are less and less a barrier 
        to trade as companies more and more manufacture in many countries and 
        move parts and components across national boundaries with the same ease 
        of movement exhibited a half century ago within national economies. A 
        consequence, in the eyes of many, if not most, economists, world per capita 
        real GDP over the past three decades has risen almost 1-1/2 percent annually, 
        and the proportion of the developing world's population that live on less 
        than one dollar per day has markedly declined. </p>
      <p>Yet globalization is by no means universally admired. The frenetic pace 
        of the competition that has characterized markets' extended global reach 
        has engendered major churnings in labor and product markets. </p>
      <p>The sensitivity of the U.S. economy and many of our trading partners 
        to foreign competition appears to have intensified recently as technological 
        obsolescence has continued to foreshorten the expected profitable life 
        of each nation's capital stock. The more rapid turnover of our equipment 
        and plant, as one might expect, is mirrored in an increased turnover of 
        jobs. A million American workers, for example, currently leave their jobs 
        every week, two-fifths involuntarily, often in association with facilities 
        that have been displaced or abandoned. A million, more or less, are also 
        newly hired or returned from layoffs every week, in part as new facilities 
        come on stream. </p>
      <p>Related to this process, jobs in the United States have been perceived 
        as migrating abroad over the years, to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 
        1960s, to low-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most recently to low-wage 
        China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce, 
        and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China. 
      </p>
      <p>In developed countries, conceptual jobs, fostered by cutting-edge technologies, 
        are occupying an ever-increasing share of the workforce and are gradually 
        replacing work that requires manual skills. Those industries in which 
        labor costs are a significant part of overall costs have been under greater 
        competition from foreign producers with lower labor costs, adjusted for 
        productivity. </p>
      <p>This process is not new. For generations human ingenuity has been creating 
        industries and jobs that never before existed, from vehicle assembling 
        to computer software engineering. With those jobs come new opportunities 
        for workers with the necessary skills. In recent years, competition from 
        abroad has risen to a point at which developed countries' lowest skilled 
        workers are being priced out of the global labor market. This diminishing 
        of opportunities for such workers is why retraining for new job skills 
        that meet the evolving opportunities created by our economies has become 
        so urgent a priority. A major source of such retraining in the United 
        States has been our community colleges, which have proliferated over the 
        past two decades. </p>
      <p>We can usually identify somewhat in advance which tasks are most vulnerable 
        to being displaced by foreign or domestic competition. But in economies 
        at the forefront of technology, most new jobs are the consequence of innovation, 
        which by its nature is not easily predictable. What we in the United States 
        do know is that, over the years, more than 94 percent of our workforce, 
        on average, has been employed as markets matched idled workers seeking 
        employment to new jobs. We can thus be confident that new jobs will displace 
        old ones as they always have, but not without a high degree of pain for 
        those caught in the job-losing segment of America's massive job-turnover 
        process. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>* * *</strong></p>
      <p> The onset of far greater flexibility in recent years in the labor and 
        product markets of the United States and the United Kingdom, to name just 
        two economies, raises the possibility of the resurrection of confidence 
        in the automatic rebalancing ability of markets, so prevalent in the period 
        before Keynes. In its modern incarnation, the reliance on markets acknowledges 
        limited roles for both countercyclical macroeconomic policies and market-sensitive 
        regulatory frameworks. The central burden of adjustment, however, is left 
        to economic agents operating freely and in their own self-interest in 
        dynamic and interrelated markets. The benefits of having moved in this 
        direction over the past couple of decades are increasingly apparent. The 
        United States has experienced quarterly declines in real GDP exceeding 
        1 percent at an annual rate on only three occasions over the past twenty 
        years. Britain has gone forty-six quarters without a downturn. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, so long as markets are free and human beings exhibit swings 
        of euphoria and distress, the business cycle will continue to plague us. 
        But even granting human imperfections, flexible economic institutions 
        appear to significantly ameliorate the amplitude and duration of the business 
        cycle. The benefits seem sufficiently large that special emphasis should 
        be placed on searching for policies that will foster still greater economic 
        flexibility while seeking opportunities to dismantle policies that contribute 
        to unnecessary rigidity. </p>
      <p>Let me raise one final caution in this otherwise decidedly promising 
        scenario. </p>
      <p>Disoriented by the quickened pace of today's competition, some in the 
        United States look back with nostalgia to the seemingly more tranquil 
        years of the early post-World War II period, when tariff walls were perceived 
        as providing job security from imports. Were we to yield to such selective 
        nostalgia and shut out a large part, or all, of imports of manufactured 
        goods and produce those goods ourselves, our overall standards of living 
        would fall. In today's flexible markets, our large, but finite, capital 
        and labor resources are generally employed most effectively. Any diversion 
        of resources from the market-guided activities would, of necessity, engender 
        a less-productive mix. </p>
      <p>For the most part, we in the United States have not engaged in significant 
        and widespread protectionism for more than five decades. The consequences 
        of moving in that direction in today's far more globalized financial world 
        could be unexpectedly destabilizing. </p>
      <p>I remain optimistic that we and our global trading partners will shun 
        that path. The evidence is simply too compelling that our mutual interests 
        are best served by promoting the free flow of goods and services among 
        our increasingly flexible and dynamic market economies. <br>
