<p>I am delighted to
be here today to offer my thoughts on an issue that I believe is important to
all of us: the long-standing decline in household saving. Since the early 1980s,
the personal saving rate has fallen steadily; on average, a household today
saves only about 1-1/2 percent of its disposable income, compared with about 11
percent in 1984. The fall in the personal saving rate could have important
implications for the ability of the country to finance investment in plant and
equipment, for future growth in productivity and real incomes, and for our
growing economic dependence on other countries to finance our spending
patterns.</p>

<p>Although my
remarks today concentrate on the behavior of household saving and overall national
saving, I also want to spend some time on a related issue: What is the
evidence on the saving of minority households? Much has been written about the
adequacy of retirement saving for many American households and the wealth
accumulation of different income cohorts. But what do we know about the saving
of minority households, and does it differ from the saving of low-income
households, where minorities are disproportionately concentrated? </p>

<p>Let me turn first
to the bigger picture. Personal saving, as measured by the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis, is essentially the amount of after-tax income left
after household bills are paid. From the end of the Second World War until the
early 1980s, the personal saving rate--personal saving expressed as a percentage
of disposable income--gradually trended up. To be sure, the saving rate showed
considerable volatility from year to year, and in some periods, such as the
second half of the 1970s, its upward drift stalled for a time. But overall,
the picture was that of a fairly steady rise in the personal saving rate, from
about 7-1/2 percent in the early 1950s to around 10-1/2 percent in the early
1980s. Since that time, however, the household saving rate has declined
precipitously and, in the last couple of years, it has averaged only about 1-1/2
percent.</p>

<p>As is often the
case with statistics, the figures I've just given are not the only word on this
subject because the government publishes additional measures of household
saving. One such measure, produced by the Federal Reserve, uses different
source data to estimate the same concept of savings. The Fed measure suggests
that households have been putting away about 3 to 4 percent of their income in
recent years, a little more than estimated by the Commerce Department. But,
importantly, it also shows the same precipitous decline since the early 1980s
in the personal saving rate. Interestingly, the Fed's study of this issue shows
that the decline in the saving rate of households at the top 20 percent of the
income distribution accounts for virtually all of the decline in the aggregate
personal saving rate since 1989, the first year for which estimates on saving
by income quintile are available. That is, the saving rates of the bottom 80
percent of the income distribution have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range
and importantly have shown no secular decline since 1989.</p>

<p><b>Should we worry about the fall
in the personal saving rate?</b><br>Do we need to
worry about the fall in the personal saving rate? Taking a big-picture point
of view and asking whether the low rate signals that adjustments are needed for
the future for the U.S. economy, the answer is a conditional &quot;yes&quot;;
but the period over which those adjustments will occur is very unclear. In the
aggregate, an economy needs to generate savings for two basic purposes--to
invest in new plant and equipment with the aim of raising future consumption
growth and to expand the residential housing stock, thereby boosting the flow
of housing services over time. Thus, the act of saving is essentially about
the allocation of an economy's resources: Some sector of the economy must be
willing to consume less than its current income to free resources for the
purchase of capital. Intuitively, we often think of saving in financial terms:
Rather than spending our entire paycheck, we put money aside into savings
accounts or certificates of deposits, and the bank lends this money to
business; or we lend directly to firms by buying corporate bonds or stocks. Similarly,
corporations save by not paying out all their profits to their stockholders.
But underlying all these financial transactions is the reallocation of
resources away from the immediate consumption of goods and services and toward
the purchase of capital goods--goods that are not consumed directly but are
instead used to produce future goods and services for consumption. </p>

<p>How much should an
economy save and invest? The answer comes down to a decision about what
combination of capital and labor inputs minimizes the cost of producing goods
and services. The cost-minimizing mix will depend on the relative prices and
relative productivity of capital and labor and on the rate of interest. If
saving is inadequate to meet these investment needs, then interest rates rise,
increasing the return to saving and perhaps boosting saving to some extent but
also making it worthwhile for firms to reorganize their production methods to
use less capital per worker. It is this consequence--operating at a lower ratio
of capital to labor--that drives the concern about adequate savings in the
economy. Over time, reducing the ratio of capital to labor in production reduces
the productive capacity of the economy. And critically for the average worker,
reducing the amount of capital per worker reduces a worker's marginal
productivity, his or her real wage rate, and of course, the sustainable amount
of his or her consumption. </p>

<p>To get some idea
about the importance of saving and investment for future productivity growth,
we can look to the past. Since the mid-1990s, productivity growth in the
nonfarm business sector has averaged a bit more than 3 percent, roughly double
its average from 1973 through 1995. Estimates produced by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, augmented by analysis carried out at the Federal Reserve and
elsewhere, suggest that about one-third of the step-up in productivity growth
is attributable directly to increases in the amount of capital per worker used
in production.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>
This so-called capital deepening has in turn come about because of the sharp
decline in the relative price of capital: For example, the price of new
high-tech capital equipment has fallen 70 percent relative to the price of
business output since the end of 1995, so that increasing the capital intensity
of production has become cost efficient. But this estimate may well understate
the total contribution from investment to labor productivity growth because of
synergies that are difficult to quantify but are significant nonetheless. For
example, newer vintages of capital may embody more-advanced technology than
older vintages and thus, even without any increase in capital intensity,
productivity would rise as new capital replaces old capital in production. </p>

<p>So if capital
investment is a critical factor behind productivity growth, why have I hedged
on the issue of whether the decline in the personal saving rate is something
about which we should be concerned? The reason is that, in a country with a
well-developed capital market, investment needs of one sector can be met by
savings of another sector. In principle, the burden of saving need not fall
exclusively or even primarily on the household sector, and indeed, the
contribution of the various sectors to aggregate saving has varied considerably
over the past fifty years.</p>

<p>For the most part,
government saving has been negative over this period; consolidating the savings
of the federal, state, and local governments indicates that, since about 1960, except
for a few years during the late 1990s, the government has spent more each year
than it has collected in tax revenues. It is the federal government that
accounts for nearly all of the negative saving; state and local governments
have generally balanced their operating budgets because most of them face
constitutional or statutory requirements to do so. </p>

<p>Although the Treasury
ran a surplus as recently as 2001, the prospects for its doing so again anytime
soon are not high. Both Social Security and Medicare face running deficits in
the near future because of factors such as the retirement of the baby-boom
generation, rapidly increasing health costs, and a slowdown in the growth rate
of the labor force. Tax cuts enacted over the past three years, although undoubtedly
supporting the economy during its recent period of recession, have also added
to the prospects for federal government deficits. In this regard, let me just
say that I fully support the goal of fiscal prudence for the federal
government: To the extent that the federal government is soaking up funds that
might otherwise be used for private domestic investment, the United States is getting
smaller productivity gains than we could be getting. </p>

<p>Foreigners are
another source of saving, and they have played an increasingly important role
over the past twenty years in financing our domestic investment. Foreign
saving is identified with our current account balance: When we import more
than we export in dollar terms, we borrow from foreigners. Between 1950 and
the early 1980s, our current account balance stayed close to zero--sometimes we
borrowed from foreigners, and other times we lent, but for many years we
remained a net global creditor. Since then we have become increasingly reliant
on the willingness of foreigners to fund our investment needs; the current
account deficit now stands at almost 6 percent of gross domestic product, and
foreigners today fund about 30 percent of our domestic investment. </p>

<p>In some respects,
this foreign borrowing is not problematic--the rest of the world supports
investment in plant and machinery while we maintain our consumption. But two
considerations weigh against foreign funding being a sustainable long-run
solution. First, continued borrowing from abroad means that foreigners have an
ever-growing claim on the nation's capital assets. Thus, a growing share of
the output produced by those assets is not ours to spend but instead goes to
foreigners in the form of dividends and interest payments. So, if the goal of
saving is to raise the capital stock in order to increase our own future
production and consumption possibilities, sending increasingly larger amounts
of additional income abroad lowers the gain from investment. Certainly, we are
still better off than we would be had the investment not occurred: Labor
productivity is increased regardless of who owns the capital stock, and as a
result, both real wage growth and future consumption growth are greater than
they would otherwise be.</p>

<p>A second reason we
should be vigilant about our growing foreign indebtedness is that, should global
investors decide to rebalance their own portfolio so as to reduce the amount of
their lending to the United States, the economy could face some significant
adjustments in numerous economic variables, including interest rates, the
composition of consumption, and the level of investment. Of course, dynamic
economies are used to seeing such changes, and for the United States, these
changes have historically been orderly. But there is always some risk, however
remote, that future changes could be less orderly than has been our experience
historically. </p>

<p>So, if depending in
the long run on government saving and foreign saving to finance private
domestic investment raises serious concerns, where does that leave us? The
answer is that the private domestic sector, households and businesses,
ultimately must generate the bulk of saving. </p>

<p> Business saving is, and
has always been, greater than household saving because corporations set aside a
large volume of income to replace aging equipment. Thus, the precipitous drop
in the share of income that households save does not translate into a proportional
drop in total private-sector savings. But, we have no evidence that business
saving has moved over time to significantly offset the downward trend in
household saving. Indeed, the ratio of gross business saving to GDP has risen only
about 1 percentage point since the mid-1980s, whereas the decline in personal
saving--again relative to GDP--has been about 7 percentage points. </p>

<p>Realistically, the
key to ensuring adequate saving in the future appears to rest on reversing or
at least containing the decline in the personal saving rate. The prospects for
doing so depend on why the personal saving rate has fallen. </p>

<p><b>Why has
the personal saving rate fallen?</b><br>Economists, as you might expect, are not in complete agreement about the
causes of the decline. Perhaps the most popular explanation is that large
capital gains on equity holdings and residential real estate have sharply
raised the net worth of many households, assuring them that they are well
positioned to meet goals for precautionary or retirement savings even while
they save less of their current income.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>
This explanation suggests that for many households the operative concept of
saving is not the portion of current income that they do not spend but rather the
change in their net worth. The former measures only the acquisition cost of
new household assets whereas the latter measures the change in the market value
of assets, which is the acquisition cost of new assets plus the capital gain or
loss on existing assets. The latter measure of saving does indeed paint a far
more positive picture of household saving behavior: The ratio of the change in
net worth to disposable income, although more volatile over the past decade
than previously, has been essentially trendless over the past two decades.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
</p>

<p>Whether or not we
should take comfort from this alternative picture of the saving rate is a
complicated issue, one that is inextricably tied to our confidence that the
price of corporate equity accurately reflects the underlying productivity of
corporate assets. One would expect that capital gains on financial or real
capital assets reflect a positive reassessment of the productivity of some
physical asset and, therefore, an increase in the potential for greater future
consumption. To this extent, capital gains serve the same function as saving
out of current income. But, it is hard to believe that all the movements in
asset prices witnessed in recent years are well-rooted in changes to the
underlying productivity of those assets. A telling reason for skepticism is the
behavior of stock prices since the late 1990s. What information on
productivity or productivity growth can account for, first, the near-tripling
of share prices during the late 1990s and, then, the retrenchment of prices in
2000 and 2001? It would appear that a portion of past swings in net worth has
reflected behavior based on something other than well-founded assessments of
changes in the underlying productive potential of existing capital. Nevertheless,
on the issue of why the personal saving rate has fallen, empirical evidence linking
the stock of wealth to consumption spending supports the view that capital
gains on corporate equities and residential real estate have been important
factors. </p>

<p>Another explanation
for the decline in the personal saving rate relates to possible upward
revisions to households' expectations for their long-run or permanent income.
Many studies of household consumption and saving behavior link current
consumption to both current income and expected future income as households
appear to smooth spending in response to fluctuations in income.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>
One consequence of this behavior is that the ratio of consumption to current
income will be higher--and hence the personal saving rate will be lower--the
higher is the expected growth rate of future income. So to the extent that
households have taken note of the step-up in productivity growth over the past
decade and have assumed that it means more rapid increases in future income,
their saving rate would fall. This belief in &quot;better economic times ahead&quot;
increases the confidence of households about their future income prospects and
encourages them to be less thrifty today. </p>

<p>Another commonly referenced
argument for the decline in the personal saving rate emphasizes the growing
importance of Social Security, Medicare, and other government transfer payments
in overall household income. These programs have the effect of shifting income
toward those portions of the population that, at least in theory, have a
relatively high propensity to spend. Moreover, by providing some insurance
against future financial hazards, the very existence of the programs has
probably reduced the incentive of even those currently not receiving such
transfers to save for retirement and other emergencies.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>
</p>

<p>Many other
theories have been put forth dissecting the fall in personal savings. One involves
financial market innovation. Since the 1980s, households have had easier
access to credit markets. Credit card usage has grown exponentially over the
past two decades, and the ratio of consumer credit to income has increased 50
percent. Mortgage credit has also become less costly to obtain, and along with
the tremendous run-up in real estate prices since the mid-1990s, it has
encouraged frequent refinancings with many households tapping into their home
equity for consumption needs.</p>

<p>Another theory
attributes the fall in the personal savings rate to the generally low level of real
interest rates in recent years. This particular theory has both supporters and
detractors in the economics profession. Whether raising the rate of return on
savings raises or reduces savings propensities remains an open question. On
the one hand, the higher return to saving should make saving more attractive;
on the other hand, a higher return means that less saving is required to achieve
any given level of wealth. The weight of empirical evidence favors a positive
relationship between interest rates and the saving rate, although the
confidence intervals around such estimates are quite large.</p>

<p><b>Will the
personal saving rate rebound?</b><br>Suffice it to say,
theories on the decline in the personal saving rate are abundant. Empirical research
suggests that multiple factors played into the decline in the rate, and the relative
contributions of the factors have fluctuated over time. Taking all the factors
into account, what are the odds of a rebound in the personal saving rate to the
average level of the 1950s through the 1980s? </p>

<p>First, current
levels of personal saving are insufficient to maintain the current ratio of
wealth to income, without significant capital gains in the future. A decline
in the ratio of wealth to income would, by itself, tend to raise the future
saving rate. To the extent that a decline in net worth relative to income turns
out to be the precipitating factor for a future rebound in the personal saving
rate, it is reasonable to expect that the saving rate of the top quintile of
the income distribution will do the bulk of the rebounding. As I noted
earlier, the saving rate of this quintile accounted for virtually all of the
decline in the aggregate personal saving rate. Because households in this
income quintile own about 65 percent of aggregate net worth, any revaluation of
assets will be felt strongly in this group and consequently their saving
behavior should most clearly reflect this influence. </p>

<p>Second, productivity
growth, or households' perceptions of such growth, could fall back from rates
experienced in the past few years, again raising personal saving rates. Once
again, this might most noticeably affect the saving rate of the top quintile of
the income distribution, at least in the short run. Why? While changes in
trend productivity growth should ultimately feed through to changes in wage
growth, the passthrough of productivity gains to wages generally is not
instantaneous. Instead, changes to productivity growth are felt first in
capital income--profits and rents and dividends--so any drop back in future
productivity growth would likely be felt first in capital income. Capital
income is of course more frequently found in the income of the top quintile
than in the lower quintiles of the income distribution.</p>

<p>A third factor that
could influence the saving rate is that market-determined interest rates may rise
from their low levels at present and thus may raise the incentive to save a
bit. Such a rise in interest rates might also tend to slow the increase in the
value of real estate and equities, eliminating some of the cushion that households
currently might count on from past high rates of capital gains and reducing the
impetus to consumption spending that mortgage refinancings have in recent years
permitted. </p>

<p>On the other hand,
government transfer payments are unlikely to fall, and financial innovation is
not going to reverse itself. </p>

<p>Although it is
difficult to predict with any precision the course of asset values, or productivity
growth, or federal entitlement programs, or even interest rates, all told I
would not expect the personal saving rate to return in the near term to the
peaks seen twenty years ago, and I would be surprised even by a return anytime
soon to the average rate that prevailed between the 1950s and the 1980s. At
the same time, I want to note that we likely will not need quite so high a
national saving rate in the future because, as the growth rate of the labor
force slows with the retirement of the baby boom generation, less investment will
be required to equip each worker with the same amount of capital. Thus the
shortfall in national savings relative to private domestic investment might be
a bit less than we would assess by looking only at national savings. But the
problem of inadequate national savings is still there.</p>

<p><b>Saving and minority households</b><br>Let me now turn
away from the issue of whether the country saves and invests enough and focus
on the issue of what we know about the wealth accumulation of minority
households. A fair number of studies exist on this subject, but two stand out.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>
Both find that, after controlling for differences in income and in demographic
factors, black families have lower wealth than white families. Thus, even if
policies designed to reduce racial differences in income were completely
successful, the bulk of the wealth differential would remain, and the ratio of
net worth to income would be lower for black families<i>. </i></p>

<p>Three principal
factors can account for this. First, black families may receive lower
inheritances or other intergenerational transfers; second, black families may
have lower propensities to save out of income; and third, black families may
experience lower rates of return on their savings. The two studies that I cited
disagree to some extent on which of these factors is most important. One study
stresses the importance of intergenerational transfers, whereas the other
stresses differences in savings behavior. But both argue that differential
rates of return are important. Black families are less inclined at most income
levels to invest in stocks, and black families are less likely to be owners of
small business. </p>

<p>Although it is
difficult to draw precise inferences regarding the key factors that have limited
minority wealth accumulation, one endeavor should pay off in terms of greater
saving by and higher net worth of minority households: increased efforts in
financial education. We at the Federal Reserve have embarked on a program to
raise the level of financial literacy in our country, and I believe that
similar programs offered by private financial institutions will also yield a
high return. Thus, I encourage all of you to work to increase the knowledge of
your depositors about financial issues. </p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>Let me briefly
conclude by restating my main points. Probably nothing is more critical to the
long-run well-being of the U.S. economy than ensuring high rates of
productivity growth. Productivity growth requires adequate levels of
investment. While foreign saving is currently a feasible source of investable
resources, it would be more economically advantageous in the longer run if we
could raise the amount of household and government savings and close the gap
between domestic investment and national savings. </p>

<p>Within the
household sector, the accumulated saving of minority households, relative to
their income, appears to be lower than that of nonminority households. In this
regard, increased efforts at financial literacy programs can have a positive payoff,
especially since at least one source of the minority-nonminority differential is
apparently due to lower rates of return earned by minority households. </p>

The influence of permanent income on consumption also has a long history in the
economics literature, and the work by Milton Friedman is among the best known
of the early papers. See, for example, Milton Friedman (1957), <i>A Theory of
the Consumption Function</i>, (Princeton: Princeton University Press. For
another early and fundamental study, see Franco Modigliani and Richard Brumberg
