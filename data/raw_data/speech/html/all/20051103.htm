	  <b>At the Cato Institute 23rd Annual Monetary Conference on Monetary Institutions & Economic 
                Development, Washington, D.C.<br>

<p>By now it must be universally agreed that low and stable inflation is a primary
and essential goal for monetary policy, in large part because we believe it
brings stability to financial systems and fosters sustainable economic growth
over the longer run.  In pursuit of this goal, central banks can report some
success.  According to the latest <i>World Economic Outlook</i> from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), consumer price inflation in the advanced economies over
the decade beginning in 1997 and ending next year looks set to come in at an
average annual rate of less than 2&nbsp;percent, down from 3-1/2 percent for the
previous ten years.  The IMF figures for the United States show a smaller but
still substantial decline in headline inflation, from about 3-3/4&nbsp;percent
to 2-1/2 percent.  The drop in inflation for the non-industrial economies has
been more striking, with average inflation falling from double to single digits
over the same time periods.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p>As someone who started work as a monetary policymaker in 1997, I am happy to
acknowledge the accomplishments of many policymakers at the Federal Reserve and
in other central banks around the world.  Thanks to their success in fighting
inflation, the central banking profession enjoys a very high standing.  And as
a related matter, we might say that monetary credibility, which I would define
as the perception in the private sector that central banks will do what it
takes to keep inflation under control, is also quite high.</p>

<p>This credibility is hard won, however, and can be easily lost. The Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) at its most recent meeting increased the federal funds
rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent, and observed: </p>

<p><blockquote>The cumulative rise in energy and
other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core
inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation
expectations remain contained. . .With underlying inflation expected to be
contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a
pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to
changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain
price stability.</blockquote></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Unfortunately,
however, the story over the past twenty years is not so uniformly positive for
growth. Again according to IMF figures, growth among the non-industrial
economies appears to have increased to about 5-1/4 percent in the decade
beginning in 1997, compared with growth of 3-3/4 percent in the previous ten
years. Growth in the United States has also moved slightly higher over the two
periods, from 3 percent to 3-1/4 percent. However, growth in the other industrial economies has softened,
to less than 2-1/2&nbsp;percent in the recent decade from more than 3 percent
in the previous one. This decline reflects slowing in some of the larger
economies--Japan, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands--as well as the effect of
the Asian crisis in 1997 on newly industrialized Asian economies.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a></p>

<p>To me, it is axiomatic that monetary credibility, by reducing the level and
variability of inflation, lays the foundations for stronger and more-sustained
economic growth. In my remarks today, I want to discuss anecdotal and academic
evidence for the relationship between monetary policy credibility and economic
growth and to do so in two segments: first, the link between monetary policy
credibility and inflation performance and, second, the link between inflation
performance and longer-run economic growth. Before proceeding, I must indicate
that the views I am about to express are my own and do not necessarily reflect
the views of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market
Committee.</p>

<p><b>Monetary Policy Credibility and Inflation Performance Outcomes</b><br>
Does monetary credibility help secure lower inflation,
less-variable inflation, and inflation that is less sensitive to shocks? Low
and stable inflation must start with sound policy--that is, policy that keeps
output near potential and offsets shocks to supply and demand appropriately.
But beyond that, common intuition and numerous academic journal articles, a few
of which I will discuss shortly, suggest that credibility can greatly enhance
the virtues of sound policy. When the central bank is viewed to be both
committed to and effective at keeping inflation contained, inflation
expectations will tend to be anchored. And so long as the central bank pursues
sensible policies, those expectations will tend to be self-fulfilling, as they
should lead to movements in prices and wages that are consistent with inflation
staying low and stable. Conversely, if credibility is lacking and inflation
expectations are high, firms will be raising prices, and workers will be
demanding large wage increases, making it more costly, in terms of jobs and
output, for the central bank to tighten policy sufficiently to achieve low
inflation. </p>

<p>One does not have to look far to see examples of the practical importance of
monetary credibility. In the past two years, crude oil prices have about
doubled. During the 1970s, similar run-ups set off sharp increases in global
inflation. Today, by contrast, core inflation rates both in the United States
and abroad, while they have moved up some, remain essentially contained. In
large part, they remain so because central banks, including the Federal
Reserve, have substantially bolstered their commitment to price stability since
the 1970s and markets are now much more confident that monetary authorities
will keep inflation from rebounding. Accordingly, rising oil prices have not
triggered a sharp rebound in long-term inflation expectations, and we have not
seen the anticipatory hikes in prices and wages that were so destabilizing a
few decades back. In essence, monetary credibility helps the central bank do
its job, by inducing private sector participants also to take actions that help
achieve the central bank's low inflation objective. Of course, given the
persistence of high energy prices that the global economy has confronted of
late, policymakers cannot be complacent. Central bankers must reinforce their
credibility and validate the confidence of market participants by actively
leaning against inflationary pressures long before inflation itself builds.
Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as
required to keep inflation at bay.</p>

<p>Aside from such anecdotal evidence, much formal research supports the view that a
strong commitment to price stability helps reduce and stabilize inflation. For
example, Gagnon and Ihrig, staff economists at the Federal Reserve, have
studied the effects of monetary policy on the response of inflation to currency
depreciation.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>
They show that, over the past few decades, the sensitivity of inflation to
currency depreciation has generally declined in industrial economies. For 18
of the 20 industrial countries studied, the authors find that the rate of
pass-through of currency depreciation to inflation fell as the rate of inflation
declined between 1971 and 2000, with pass-through in the second half of the
sample period averaging about a third of what it was in the first half. In
addition, they find that these declines tended to be larger in countries where
central banks increased the weight they placed on fighting inflation. The
Gagnon and Ihrig result represents evidence that a strong commitment to price
stability can lead to more-stable prices, but it leaves open the extent to
which central bank credibility--as opposed to policy action--contributes to
this outcome.</p>

<p>Other research, conducted by Laxton and N'Diaye at the IMF, shows that a model of
inflation and unemployment performs better when inflation expectations are entered
into the model as a function of long-term bond yields than when such
expectations are assumed to depend on past inflation alone.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>
Thus, their research affirms the influence of inflation expectations on actual
inflation. Whether these expectations reflect monetary credibility, as the
researchers argue, remains unclear.</p>

<p>Finally, there is considerable literature on the effects of central bank independence on
inflation.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a>
In one standard view, politically motivated desires to stimulate the economy,
run budget deficits, or redistribute wealth in favor of one social group or
another are important sources of inflationary pressure. These pressures have
long been part of the political landscape, and indeed, it was for these reasons
that the framers of the Federal Reserve sought to insulate the Fed from
political pressures.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>
</p>

<p>That central bank independence frees the monetary authority to pursue price
stability more diligently, resulting in lower and less-variable inflation, is
supported by many studies.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a>
Inflation tends to be lower in countries where there are legal and other
institutional safeguards to central bank independence. Of course, such results
still do not tell us whether central bank independence matters mainly because
it allows the central bank to pursue better policies or because it boosts the
central bank's credibility. </p>

<p>In spite of this ample academic evidence of the role of good policy and central
bank independence in achieving price stability, we must face the fact that the particular
contribution of monetary credibility, as contrasted with the contribution of
central bank policies themselves, is difficult to measure. Not only does
effective central bank policy lead to good inflation outcomes, but it is the
primary contributor to monetary credibility. Sound policy and credibility are
tightly, and perhaps inextricably, intertwined and cannot be separately
measured with current statistical techniques. </p>

<p>Am I bothered by the paucity of direct academic evidence regarding the specific
role of monetary credibility? Not at all. The research I have briefly
described makes clear that a commitment to fighting inflation, low inflation
expectations, and central bank independence all contribute to restraining
inflation. Thus, it would be surprising if monetary credibility did not play a
role, even if, because it cannot be directly measured, its specific
contribution is hard to gauge. Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that
monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is
supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building
and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable. The effective central bank
will pursue such policies regardless of how important it believes the role of
monetary credibility to be.</p>

<p><b>Inflation Performance and Economic Growth</b><br>
Assuming that monetary credibility does make it easier for central banks to pursue the objective
of price stability, what can we say about how stable prices affect the bottom
line--economic activity and growth? Empirical research attempting to establish
solid links between low inflation and sustainable economic growth has met with
mixed success, in part because of the many complicated factors determining both
inflation and growth. </p>

<p>Following seminal work by Stanley Fischer, researchers seem to agree that extreme
inflation rates, say above 40 percent per year, are associated with reduced
economic growth.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a>
Such high rates of inflation are often a sign of an economy in or approaching
crisis, and once inflation crosses the threshold of 40 percent, inflation is
considerably more unstable and likely to rise. Under such conditions, firms have
great difficulty in setting prices and consumers in appraising them. In
general, growth slows during such crises, as evidenced by the collapse of the
Argentine economy during its hyperinflation at the end of the 1980s or the
ravages of the European hyperinflations of the 1920s.</p>

<p>In these situations, the association between growth and inflation is clear,
although causality can be difficult to disentangle. But what can we say about
lower inflation rates? Is the pace of economic development slower when
inflation is at 15 percent than when it is at 5 percent? Research by IMF staff
economists Khan and Senhadji has turned up a negative association between
inflation and growth. Using nonlinear estimation techniques, these economists
report finding thresholds above which inflation significantly slows growth.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a>
The thresholds identified in this work are 1 percent to 3 percent for
industrial economies and 11 percent to 12 percent for developing economies. </p>

<p>To be completely fair regarding the academic literature, however, others have not
found such a clear relationship. Levine and Renelt (1992), for example, found
no robust relationship in exhaustive cross-section studies, and many
researchers using other techniques have also failed to detect a significant
relationship.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a></p>

<p>The problem may lie in identifying the direction of causation: In the
short-to-medium run, causality may run from higher growth to higher inflation,
as business-cycle pressures push spending and activity above the economy's
capacity. This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship,
running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer
term. </p>

<p>Of course, as a central banker, it makes sense to me that lower and more-stable
inflation, by making the returns to saving and investment more predictable and
by diminishing the likelihood of shocks to the financial system, should
encourage economic growth. For example, the United States has experienced a
higher average, and less volatile, growth rate since the mid-1980s. This &quot;Great
Moderation&quot; has been attributed by most observers, at least in part, to
improved monetary policy and, by extension, to lower and more-stable inflation.<a href="#fn11" title="footnote 11"><sup>11</sup></a><a name="f11"></a>
Low and stable inflation offers other benefits as well, which may affect the
growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) over time. These include reducing
the arbitrary redistributions of wealth and income associated with higher and more-variable
inflation and shrinking the distortions to resource allocation in the tax code. <a href="#fn12" title="footnote 12"><sup>12</sup></a><a name="f12"></a>
Accordingly, and I am obviously not alone in this view, it is clear that central
banks should strive to achieve low, stable inflation. </p>

<p>Of course, low inflation is at best a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for
growth. In many poor economies, inflation may be less of an obstacle to
development than poor governance, inadequate education, and legal systems that
fail to protect property rights or to enforce commercial contracts. Yet, no
tradeoff forces countries to choose between lowering inflation and reforming
their institutions. On the contrary, high inflation is often a sign of
institutional breakdown, and reducing inflation may help to rebuild confidence
in economic and political prospects.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two
decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were
earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at
times severely, to bring inflation down. With longer-run inflation
expectations better anchored now throughout the world, I believe that global economic
growth will be stronger and more resilient as a result. If the academic
evidence does not yet unequivocally support this conclusion, perhaps it is
because we are only starting to see the return to sacrifices made in the past.
My generation of central bankers has the job of maintaining the victories of the
previous generation and of using all our tools to keep inflation expectations
contained and inflation low and stable. We owe our predecessors and our fellow
citizens nothing less.</p>

The volatility of U.S. GDP has declined markedly since the mid-1980s from the
volatility of the previous couple of decades.  This moderation has several
possible explanations, and better monetary policy is seen as one.  Others
include milder economic shocks, improved inventory management, and financial
innovation.  On the last, see Karen E. Dynan, Douglas W. Elmendorf, and Daniel
