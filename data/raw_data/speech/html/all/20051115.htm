        Unified National Payments System in the United States </strong>
      </P>
	  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
        Good morning. I would like to thank the World Savings Banks Institute, 
        as well as the European Savings Banks Group, for the invitation to address 
        this distinguished audience. I appreciate the opportunity to share some 
        thoughts on the development of a unified national payments system in the 
        United States. I am looking forward to Ms. Tumpel-Gugerell's remarks on 
        the euro system's perspective, and I anticipate a lively panel discussion 
        will follow.</p>
      <p> The European Union and the United States have had very different experiences 
        with the origin and evolution of their payments systems. There is a great 
        deal to learn by studying both systems and their ongoing changes. This 
        morning, I would like to discuss the development of a unified national 
        payments system, or single payments area, in the United States. I will 
        sketch the foundations of the contemporary U.S. payments system and remark 
        on the history of U.S. banking. I think you will recognize some parallels 
        with, but also important differences from, the European Union experience. 
        I will then discuss some of the challenges in the U.S. experience, as 
        well as some thoughts on the future of the U.S. payments system. The overarching 
        theme of my remarks is that the United States has evolved toward an increasingly 
        unified national payments system, through both market-driven development 
        and some specific public-sector actions.</p>
      <p> <strong>A Brief History of the U.S. Banking and Payments System</strong><br>
        From the late 1700s through the mid-1800s, the development of the U.S. 
        banking system was dominated by roles played by individual states. Generally, 
        commercial banks were not chartered by the federal government; rather, 
        they were chartered, regulated, and supervised by the states and operated 
        under different state legal and regulatory frameworks. The explicit delegation 
        of bank supervision to the states reflected the strong preference for 
        decentralized authority and resulted in the first brief efforts to establish 
        a national bank. In 1791, the federal government chartered the First Bank 
        of the United States with a twenty-year charter, its first attempt to 
        establish a central bank. After that charter lapsed in 1811, the federal 
        government in 1816 made a second attempt to form a central bank, by establishing 
        the Second Bank of the United States. That twenty-year charter was also 
        allowed to lapse amid the economic and political controversies of that 
        time.</p>
      <p> In ensuing years, the banking system was highly decentralized with individual 
        state-chartered commercial banks issuing their own bank notes. Although 
        there has been an academic debate about the success of this period of 
        competitive, private-bank note issuance, the federal government ultimately 
        acted to address significant problems posed by this banking structure. 
        In the payments system, for example, state bank notes were subject to 
        devaluation in response to credit risk and to counterfeiting, creating 
        a significant burden on local and interstate commerce. In 1863 and 1865, 
        the National Bank Acts permitted the federal government to charter national 
        banks and allowed these banks to issue national bank notes backed by federal 
        bonds. The collateralization of national bank notes with U.S. government 
        bonds, along with a 10 percent tax on state notes, expedited the acceptance 
        of national bank notes and quickly eliminated state notes from circulation. 
        In addition, the United States Treasury also began directly issuing notes 
        backed by gold in the 1870s. These developments were important first steps 
        in unifying the national payments system.</p>
      <p> In retrospect, the overall fragmentation of the U.S. banking system 
        helped produce a fragmented national retail payments system, including 
        a fragmented check-clearing system. Checks, which were traditionally cleared 
        through local private clearing houses or correspondent banks, were the 
        predominant alternative to making payments with bank notes or gold. However, 
        checks were not paid at par. That is, checks cleared between banks in 
        different states or locales were discounted based on the costs of transportation 
        needed to collect the checks, the risk profiles of the banks on which 
        the checks were drawn, and the need to earn a return on clearing activities. 
        Neither the consumer nor the merchant knew how much of the value of a 
        check would ultimately be delivered to the intended beneficiary, so it 
        was difficult to determine the value of a check needed to pay a bill. 
        As the level of interstate commerce grew, the costs associated with this 
        inefficient practice became quite burdensome. Also, collecting a check 
        could take a long time. Because a check could be forwarded to numerous 
        correspondent banks before ultimately being presented for payment, some 
        public officials charged that banks deliberately engaged in the &#8220;circuitous 
        routing&#8221; of checks to exploit the inefficiencies of the payments 
        system.</p>
      <p> The risks and inefficiencies in the fragmented banking system also resulted 
        in bank panics, which were relatively common, and made it difficult to 
        transfer liquidity from one region of the country to another. In 1913, 
        the U.S. Congress established the Federal Reserve System, not only to 
        provide greater financial stability and to improve banking supervision, 
        but also to provide an elastic currency and a national check-clearing 
        system. The Federal Reserve began issuing currency in 1914. Moreover, 
        checks that were cleared through the Federal Reserve and that were drawn 
        on Federal Reserve member banks were exchanged at par value.</p>
      <p> In the early days, the Federal Reserve's national check-clearing service 
        was provided free of charge to nationally chartered banks that were required 
        to join the system and state-chartered banks that joined voluntarily. 
        Despite some early difficulties with achieving widespread par clearing, 
        the Federal Reserve's check collection services ultimately provided the 
        nation with a much more unified payments system.</p>
      <p> During this period, checks or drafts were also used as a means of settling 
        interbank payment obligations. To improve the safety and efficiency of 
        the interbank settlement process, in 1918 the Federal Reserve developed 
        and implemented Fedwire, the first real-time gross settlement system. 
        The key feature of the Fedwire system was the ability to transfer account 
        balances held at the central bank through telegraphic messages using a 
        secure communications network. Although Fedwire was intended to improve 
        the large-value payment system, and quickly accomplished that goal, it 
        was also used for some urgent large-value commercial and retail payments, 
        and continues to be used that way today.</p>
      <p> The payments operations of state and federally chartered private banks, 
        private clearing houses, and the operations of the new central bank, provided 
        the foundation for the private- and public-sector payments infrastructure 
        that exists in the United States today. Yet for many years, policies that 
        deterred interstate banking shaped the design and operation of the retail 
        payments system. The U.S. banking and payments system has also been shaped 
        by other important state and federal laws. Starting in the late 1800s, 
        states attempted to develop a more-uniform set of commercial laws codifying 
        existing laws and common business practices. They eventually adopted the 
        Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC, which states generally enacted. At the 
        federal level, a number of laws influenced the development of the banking 
        system. </p>
      <p> Laws such as the McFadden Act and the Douglas Amendment to the Bank 
        Holding Company Act were passed to restrict either bank ownership or bank 
        branching across state lines. Over the years, legislation enacted by the 
        various states, and ultimately at the federal level, eliminated the barriers 
        to banks operating across state lines, at least with respect to interstate 
        bank acquisitions. In 1994, the Riegle-Neal Act, which repealed most of 
        the federal prohibitions on interstate banking, set the foundation for 
        establishing efficient, national retail banking and payment arrangements.</p>
      <p> If the U.S. banking structure is the foundation of the retail payments 
        system, the cornerstone is the competitive market model for payment system 
        operators. The Monetary Control Act of 1980, or MCA, codified the use 
        of the competitive market model for the U.S. payments system with the 
        central bank as a provider of services. Prior to that Act, only Federal 
        Reserve member banks were permitted to use the Federal Reserve's (free) 
        payment services. Nonmembers typically cleared checks through a network 
        of upstream correspondent banks that were Federal Reserve members. The 
        MCA confirmed the Federal Reserve's role as a key provider of services 
        and required the Federal Reserve to provide payment services to both member 
        and nonmember banks. Most importantly, the MCA required the Federal Reserve 
        to price its payment services and to fully recover the costs of providing 
        those services, including imputed taxes and profits. The purpose of this 
        requirement was to avoid having the central bank underprice payment services 
        in a way that would undercut the existence and growth of private-sector 
        alternatives. The ultimate goal was to stimulate efficiency and innovation 
        by encouraging competition between service providers and payment system 
        operators, including the central bank.</p>
      <p> The legal framework governing payment systems has continued to evolve. 
        In its role as catalyst for payments system improvements, the Federal 
        Reserve has worked with the private sector to identify and address barriers 
        to improvements in payments system efficiency. It then developed legislative 
        recommendations that eventually became the Check Clearing for the 21st 
        Century Act, known as Check 21. Check 21, which became effective in 2004, 
        eliminated legal impediments to the use of electronic technologies to 
        collect checks. Under Check 21, banks no longer need to physically move 
        original paper checks from the bank where the checks are deposited to 
        the bank that pays them. The law created a new negotiable instrument called 
        a substitute check, which permitted banks to truncate original checks, 
        to send digital check images across the country, and to deliver paper 
        substitute checks to banks that wanted to continue receiving paper checks. 
        As a result, checks will ultimately be collected faster and at lower cost 
        through an electronic national clearing structure. </p>
      <p> <strong>Consumer Behavior and Market Response in the Future U.S. Payments 
        System</strong><br>
        The development and adoption of new payments instruments is largely being 
        influenced by consumers, merchants, and their banks and service providers 
        interacting in a market setting. Until very recently, checks have been 
        the dominant form of noncash payment in the U.S. payments system as measured 
        by the annual number of payments. However, the 1990s saw a marked shift 
        in consumers' behavior. Federal Reserve research has revealed a steady 
        decline in check usage since the mid-1990s. By 2003, electronic noncash 
        retail payments exceeded check payments for the first time. </p>
      <p> Debit cards, used primarily by consumers for everyday purchases, have 
        represented the fastest growing segment of the retail payments system. 
        They have been a natural bridge from cash and checks to electronics. Historically, 
        automated teller machine and debit card networks, much like the early 
        check-clearing network in the U.S., were generally regionally based. Banks 
        issued debit cards that could be used only on certain networks, which 
        had limited reach across state lines. This meant that, although early 
        debit cards were a convenient new way to make noncash payments, the scope 
        of their use was limited. Some networks developed interchange agreements 
        to expand the acceptance of their debit cards. In addition, as debit cards 
        evolved, the major credit card companies and their banks began to issue 
        a new type of debit card that operated through the existing national credit 
        card networks. The use of these so-called signature-based debit cards 
        has been growing rapidly for several years.</p>
      <p> Another payment mechanism that was developed jointly by the private 
        sector and the Federal Reserve was the automated clearinghouse, or ACH, 
        system. The ACH system is a batch electronic payment system that has traditionally 
        been used to process recurring credit and debit transactions, such as 
        payroll payments, mortgage and utility payments, and government benefits. 
        In its infancy, the ACH system was a segmented regional system that has 
        since evolved into a nationwide payments system. More recently, banks 
        have used the ACH system in innovative ways to make nonrecurring payments, 
        such as payments over the telephone or Internet, which were typically 
        made by credit or debit card. In addition, businesses that receive large 
        numbers of checks from customers are obtaining their customers' permission 
        to convert the checks into ACH payments. As a result, the ACH has exhibited 
        significant growth in recent years and is contributing to the decline 
        in the number of payments being processed as checks.</p>
      <p> It remains to be seen how significant an effect recently emerging instruments 
        such as payroll cards, stored-value cards, or electronic benefits transfer 
        instruments will have on the payments landscape. Whether or not these 
        instruments are broadly accepted will depend largely on consumer and business 
        preferences, and on how much of an improvement these instruments are over 
        competing payment instruments. It is difficult to foresee how quickly 
        and in what forms alternative payments will evolve in the U.S. economy. 
        It is likely, however, that the evolution will continue to be market-driven.</p>
      <p> In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the national payments system 
        of the United States has evolved through both private- and public-sector 
        contributions. Both sectors have been involved in technological innovation 
        and the development of payments infrastructure. In addition, the public 
        sector has responded by addressing legal and other barriers that adversely 
        affect the banking system. Together, private and public sectors have contributed 
        to a more-efficient national payments system that facilitates greater 
        commerce and innovation. Looking forward, market needs will ultimately 
        shape the U.S. payments system and its direction. If the past is a guide, 
        geography will continue to decline as an important factor in the national 
        payments system just as it has in other areas of economic activity. </p>
