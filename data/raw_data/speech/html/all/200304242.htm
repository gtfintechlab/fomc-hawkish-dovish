<p>The recession that began in the United States in March 2001 is distinctive 
        in being one of the few business-led--as opposed to household-led--recessions 
        of the post-World War II period. Typically, U.S. recessions have featured 
        downturns in household spending, with housing and consumer durables being 
        the most severely affected, and with business spending on capital goods 
        playing a secondary and generally reactive role. In the recent episode, 
        by contrast, business fixed investment began to weaken well before the 
        official peak of the business cycle, contracting in real terms from the 
        fourth quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of last year. In an arithmetic 
        sense at least, this decline in investment accounted for a very substantial 
        part of the general economic slowdown of the past few years. Meanwhile, 
        completing the role reversal, households maintained their spending remarkably 
        well, particularly on new homes and automobiles. 
      <p>Although the U.S. economy has managed modest real growth through 2002 
        and into 2003, most economists agree that a strong and well-balanced recovery 
        will require a greater contribution from the business sector, in the form 
        of increased capital investment and hiring. Today my focus will be on 
        the prospects for capital investment. I will review some of the factors 
        that contributed to the investment boom and bust of the past few years, 
        and then I will turn to the difficult issue of whether we can expect a 
        sufficient rebound in business investment to keep the economy on a recovery 
        path in 2003 and 2004. Along the way I will touch on a few related issues, 
        such as the debate about whether the economy currently faces a "capital 
        overhang" that is inhibiting new investment. Before proceeding, I should 
        note that my comments today reflect my own opinions and not necessarily 
        those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
        or the Federal Open Market Committee.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>  
      <p><strong>How the Federal Reserve Board Staff Forecasts Business Investment 
        Spending</strong><br>
        As background for my discussion of the recent and likely future behavior 
        of business investment--and in recognition that my audience consists of 
        the distinguished membership of the Forecasters Club--let me begin with 
        a few words on how the Federal Reserve Board staff forecasts business 
        spending on new capital goods. 
      <p>For relatively short horizons, say this quarter and next, the forecasting 
        of business fixed investment (like most other macroeconomic variables) 
        is largely an exercise in applied data analysis. As an organizing principle, 
        the Board staff tries to mimic the methodology used by the Bureau of Economic 
        Analysis in creating the National Income and Product Accounts series for 
        real business fixed investment. For example, following the procedures 
        of the BEA, the staff uses detailed data on manufacturers' shipments of 
        nondefense capital goods, published by the Bureau of the Census and other 
        government agencies, to develop monthly estimates of nominal spending 
        on most major types of equipment. Similarly, monthly data on construction 
        put in place are used to estimate nominal investment in commercial buildings 
        and other types of structures. The staff converts these nominal spending 
        figures into real terms using producer price indexes or other appropriate 
        deflators. In addition to this translation of monthly data published in 
        regular government reports, the Board staff follows BEA procedure in estimating 
        investment in aircraft and motor vehicles from information supplied by 
        the manufacturers directly. 
      <p>Of course, not all the data necessary to replicate the BEA's calculation 
        of business investment for the current quarter are typically available, 
        and virtually none is available for subsequent quarters. Estimating investment 
        spending therefore requires projections over the next few months of the 
        various components of shipments, construction put in place, and other 
        relevant data. The staff makes these projections with the help of various 
        statistical techniques, taking into account the predictive power of related 
        quantitative indicators, such as new orders. 
      <p>In constructing its short-term forecasts, the staff has also found it 
        useful to supplement the available, largely preliminary data on shipments 
        and orders of capital goods with a variety of qualitative information. 
        Examples include material from the Fed's Beige Book, which includes reports 
        about current conditions in the twelve Federal Reserve Districts; the 
        Institute for Supply Management's national surveys of purchasing managers 
        and related regional surveys; various other surveys conducted by both 
        nonprofit groups and private firms; industry reports; and reports and 
        anecdotes from business contacts. Finally, near-term investment projections 
        are assessed for reasonableness relative to the picture presented by broader 
        macroeconomic indicators, such as measures of production, inventories, 
        and hiring. 
      <p>Detailed data analyses of this type are useful in predicting business 
        investment for the current and following quarter. But monetary policymaking 
        requires projections for longer horizons, up to six to eight quarters 
        ahead. To obtain forecasts of investment for those longer horizons, the 
        staff relies on formal econometric models combined with additional statistical 
        and qualitative information. The staff employs a suite of forecasting 
        equations for investment, varying in details of specification. This eclecticism 
        reflects the failure of any single specification to emerge as the clearly 
        "best" model of investment. Indeed, these equations are perpetually works 
        in progress, as forecasting errors are analyzed and performance is compared 
        to alternatives. However, the models which are most heavily used all belong 
        to the same general family, the so-called <em>neoclassical model of investment</em>, 
        most closely associated with Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University 
        (Jorgenson, 1963; Hall and Jorgenson, 1967). 
      <p>According to the neoclassical model, which is based on an analysis of 
        the marginal costs and benefits to a firm of acquiring additional capital 
        goods, investment spending by firms depends primarily on two factors: 
        first, the projected growth in business output, as determined by final 
        demand, and, second, the cost of acquiring and using capital goods, the 
        so-called <em>user cost of capital</em>. Higher projected output growth 
        naturally leads firms to expand their capacity to produce by investing 
        in new capital goods. This relationship between the rate of growth of 
        demand and the level of investment spending, dubbed the accelerator effect, 
        is a venerable and empirically well-supported relationship in economics. 
        The fact that investment spending itself is part of final demand, however, 
        leads to a certain circularity in the analysis: If firms decide to invest 
        aggressively, then final demand will be high, justifying the rapid pace 
        of investment; but likewise, weak investment demand can be partly self-justifying 
        (Kiyotaki, 1988). This possibility of self-justifying optimism or pessimism 
        inevitably creates a role for expectations and attitudes in the analysis, 
        a point to which I will return. 
      <p>The second factor that determines investment spending in the staff model, 
        the user cost of capital, is more precisely defined as the after-tax, 
        per-period cost of using a capital good--it may be thought of as the per-period 
        rental cost of capital. The user cost of capital depends in turn on such 
        factors as the prices of new capital goods, the real interest rate at 
        which firms must borrow to finance their investment spending, the rate 
        at which capital depreciates, and the degree to which the tax code subsidizes 
        or penalizes investment. Not surprisingly, increases in the user cost 
        of capital have been found to reduce business investment, although the 
        size of the effect is less well identified statistically and more controversial 
        among economists than the effect of output growth mentioned previously. 
      <p>A practical question is whether business investment should be forecast 
        as an aggregate quantity or broken down in some way and forecast component 
        by component. The Board staff have found a significant benefit, in terms 
        of reduced forecasting error both in and out of sample, in modeling investment 
        by asset class--for example, in forecasting investment in computers separately 
        from investment in other types of equipment, or investment in office buildings 
        separately from investment in drilling rigs. I will give a concrete example 
        of the advantages of disaggregated forecasting in a moment. 
      <p>The Board staff's econometric models of investment have performed well 
        over the years. However, business investment can be highly volatile from 
        quarter to quarter, a fact that makes forecasting misses--sometimes quite 
        large ones--simply inevitable. A major reason that investment can sometimes 
        be hard to predict is the inherently forward-looking and subjective nature 
        of investment decisions. When firm managers are highly optimistic about 
        the potential of a new technology, a new product, or a new market, for 
        example, they are likely to invest aggressively, almost independently 
        of the level of interest rates and similar "fundamentals." But likewise, 
        if beliefs become more pessimistic, investment can fall significantly, 
        even when financing is easy. Keynes referred to the sometimes rapid changes 
        in mood of business leaders as "animal spirits." Reasonable people can 
        disagree about the importance of this phenomenon in general, but we seem 
        to have seen more of it lately than usual. Recognizing the subjective 
        nature of the investment decision, the staff makes substantial efforts 
        to gather information about management expectations, as reflected for 
        example in analyst earnings projections, surveys, industry reports, interviews, 
        and the like. Particularly at turning points, this type of information 
        may provide important additional insights into the likely course of investment 
        spending. 
      <p>I close this brief survey of forecasting at the Board by emphasizing 
        that the staff forecast is just that--the staff's. Monetary policy decisions 
        are made by twelve of the nineteen members of the Federal Open Market 
        Committee: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the President 
        of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven 
        Reserve Bank presidents, among whom the vote rotates annually. I suspect 
        that, at any given meeting of the FOMC, virtually every member of the 
        Committee disagrees with <em>some</em> aspect of the staff's forecast--quite 
        possibly in mutually inconsistent ways. Nevertheless, we take the staff 
        forecast as an informative and highly useful starting point for a productive 
        discussion of the prospects for the economy and the way that policy should 
        respond. 
      <p><strong>The Investment Boom of the Nineties</strong><br>
        With this background, I now review the recent behavior of investment, 
        concentrating on business fixed investment, or investment in nonresidential 
        structures as well as equipment and software. (For now I omit residential 
        investment--that is, investment in housing--and investment in inventory 
        stocks.) The weakness of business fixed investment during the past three 
        years contrasts sharply with the investment boom that was one of the most 
        striking features of the U.S. economy in the 1990s, particularly during 
        the second half of the decade. Growth in real investment averaged close 
        to 10 percent per year between 1995 and early 2000. For comparison, during 
        the strong 1983-87 recovery, real investment grew less than 6 percent 
        per year. The rapid pace of business investment in the nineties was central 
        to the unusually high rates of economic growth, low rates of unemployment, 
        and rapid productivity growth that we observed during that period. 
      <p>Broadly speaking, the factors that the neoclassical model suggests would 
        be needed to underpin an investment boom were indeed present during the 
        late nineties. Final demand and hence output grew strongly, and the user 
        cost of capital was falling. However, as Tevlin and Whelan (2003) have 
        shown in a recent paper, explaining the <em>magnitude</em> of the nineties 
        boom requires modeling the component parts of investment separately, as 
        the Board staff does in practice. In particular, a disproportionate part 
        of the investment boom of the nineties can be attributed to investment 
        in computers, software, and communications equipment, so that an important 
        step toward explaining the overall boom in investment is explaining the 
        surge in these high-tech categories. 
      <p>In their paper, Tevlin and Whelan identified two factors that gave a 
        strong impetus particularly to investment in computers during this period. 
        First, the costs of computing power fell sharply in the late 1990s, arguably 
        reflecting a pickup in the pace of technological advance as well as an 
        intensification of competition among the major chip makers. As a result, 
        the user cost of capital for computers and related equipment declined 
        even more rapidly than earlier in the decade. Together with strong overall 
        business conditions, these low and falling costs of computing power induced 
        many firms to make major investments in information technologies. Second, 
        generally speaking, computers exhibit high rates of economic depreciation; 
        for example, new applications requiring greater speed or more memory sometimes 
        make existing computers effectively obsolete within a few years. High 
        rates of economic depreciation imply rapid replacement cycles, and hence 
        high rates of gross investment in computers. Tevlin and Whelan showed 
        that these two factors--low and falling prices of computing power and 
        high economic depreciation rates--can explain much of the high rates of 
        gross investment in computers during the nineties; and that these high 
        rates of investment in computers in turn help to explain a substantial 
        part of the overall investment boom.
      <p> Although econometric models can do a reasonable job of explaining the 
        investment boom of the late nineties, standard models do not fully capture 
        other factors that boosted investment spending during that period, especially 
        in the high-tech sector. For example, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 
        was intended to increase competition in the telecom sector. Many firms 
        apparently believed that the dominant market share would go to companies 
        with the biggest networks and the most "cutting-edge" technologies; consequently, 
        investment boomed in the telecom sector. Similarly, deregulation of the 
        electric power grid may have spurred increased investment in power systems. 
        Outside the legislative arena, rapidly increasing access to the Internet 
        raised the possibility of a huge new on-line demand for products and services, 
        which spurred a wave of new dot-com startup companies hoping to be the 
        first to meet that anticipated demand. Established firms, from booksellers 
        to clothing retailers, responded with their own on-line marketing outlets, 
        which further boosted the demand for servers, software, and other components. 
        In addition, concerns about the potential effects of the Y2K date change 
        led many firms to accelerate their replacement cycles and order new software 
        and computing equipment. 
      <p>In short, during the latter part of the nineties, strong economic fundamentals 
        conjoined with what, in retrospect in least, seems to have been a less 
        well grounded increase in general optimism about the long-term potential 
        of new technologies. (I say "seems" in all seriousness. We are not in 
        the long run yet.) In any event, given this optimism and the attendant 
        rise in earnings forecasts and the stock market, together with good fundamentals 
        in terms of high demand, falling equipment prices, and moderate financing 
        costs, the late-nineties boom in investment is perhaps not so difficult 
        to understand. 
      <p><strong>The Investment Bust of 2000-02</strong><br>
        In the second half of 2000, business fixed investment began to decline 
        markedly; between the third quarter of 2000 and the third quarter of last 
        year, the level of real investment outlays declined 12 percent. The drop 
        in investment in computer and communications equipment was particularly 
        sharp. As I noted earlier, this decline in investment led the business 
        cycle, an unusual pattern for the post-World War II period. 
      <p>Standard investment models can explain a portion of the sudden weakening 
        of investment spending in mid-2000. For example, the user cost of equipment 
        and software is estimated to have increased in 1999, the first such increase 
        since 1994. Among the factors contributing to the rising user cost was 
        a much less rapid decline in the relative price of computing power, perhaps 
        reflecting a slowdown in the pace of technological advance, and a policy 
        tightening by the Fed (in part, an unwinding of the easing that took place 
        during the Russian debt crisis). Some weakening also occurred in the demand 
        for business output, including most notably a mild deceleration of personal 
        consumption expenditures early in 2000. The strength of the dollar hurt 
        demand as well, particularly in the manufacturing sector. One should also 
        keep in mind that, besides the modest weakening in fundamentals, investment 
        booms are naturally followed by some slowdown as firms reach their desired 
        level of capital. 
      <p>However, even taking all these factors into account, the fact is that 
        standard investment models missed much of the drop in investment that 
        began in 2000. The importance of disaggregation was illustrated once again, 
        as most of the miss was accounted for by overprediction of investment 
        in high-tech equipment and software. Clearly, factors other than those 
        in the standard model must have been at work in that sector. The most 
        promising place to look for explanations is in the expectations and attitudes 
        of the managers entrusted with making investment decisions. 
      <p>As we can see, in retrospect at least, the year 2000 was one of re-evaluation, 
        particularly for high-tech investment. Though the evidence is strong that 
        high-tech investments have greatly enhanced productivity in the economy, 
        by 2000 many managers had apparently become concerned that the long-term 
        profit potential of their investments in computers and communications 
        equipment was smaller than they had expected. In some cases the difficulties 
        were technological, sometimes (as in the case of on-line retailing) the 
        expected level of consumer demand did not materialize, sometimes the business 
        plans were faulty, sometimes economic or regulatory conditions were not 
        as had been expected, and sometimes the productivity enhancements were 
        less than anticipated. This shift in expectations can be seen clearly 
        in the downward revisions to analysts' long-term earnings expectations 
        (which mirrored declines in equity prices) beginning in the second half 
        of 2000. Analysts' forecasts of long-term earnings growth for the Standard 
        & Poor's 500 companies index declined from about 15 percent per year at 
        their peak in 2000 to less than 12 percent recently (still a historically 
        high level, however). Indeed for this period, augmenting the Tevlin-Whelan 
        model of investment with analysts' long-term expectations substantially 
        improves the fit--although it by no means eliminates all or even most 
        of the puzzle in investment spending during this period.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>  
      <p>As management expectations changed, so did the economic environment and 
        firms' investment behavior. Replacement cycles for high-tech equipment 
        apparently slowed, as firms became more skeptical of the business case 
        for next-generation computers and software--particularly since they had 
        just upgraded their information technology in preparation for the Y2K 
        date change. Moreover no "killer apps" that required further system upgrades 
        seemed to be on the horizon. The failures of scores of dot-coms and telecom 
        startups reduced competitive pressure and the perceived urgency of maintaining 
        technological leadership. Both financial markets and the general economy 
        were becoming decidedly less hospitable to firms oriented toward new technologies. 
        In short, a major shift in management expectations about the profit potential 
        of new investments, particularly high-tech investments, is key to explaining 
        the investment bust of 2000-02. 
      <p><strong>A Capital Overhang?</strong><br>
        The factors just discussed, including the re-evaluation of the long-term 
        profitability of high-tech investments, go a long way toward explaining 
        the decline in investment spending that began in the latter part of 2000. 
        However, some observers have suggested that the problem is deeper and 
        has longer-term consequences than I have suggested so far. Specifically, 
        they have argued that investment during the late 1990s was so great that 
        actual capital stocks rose substantially above long-run desired levels, 
        creating a "capital overhang." Barring a major increase in the desired 
        level of capital, a true capital overhang would imply little or no investment 
        in that particular type of capital for possibly quite a long time, until 
        excess capital has been depreciated away. 
      <p>Is there a capital overhang in the U.S. economy? I believe that this 
        description was a reasonable one for certain sectors during the early 
        stages of the downturn. Telecommunications companies no doubt invested 
        too much in long-haul fiber networks, as firms competed to establish the 
        largest and most complete networks. (I note, however, that economies of 
        scale in laying fiber together with a low in-ground rate of physical depreciation 
        imply that once a trench is dug, more fiber should be laid than will be 
        needed for quite a while.) Too many startup Internet companies bought 
        too many servers and routers, and the failure of large numbers of high-tech 
        companies contributed to a glut in office space, which is particularly 
        evident in technology centers like San Francisco and Seattle. Undoubtedly 
        the current supply of commercial aircraft is excessive, though arguably 
        much of this sector's overcapacity results from September 11 and structural 
        problems specific to the airline industry rather than from a period of 
        extensive overbuilding. 
      <p>However, the more pressing question is, how many of these putative sectoral 
        overhangs remain relevant today? For high-technology equipment, in my 
        view, overhang effects are probably by this time not of great quantitative 
        importance. In communications, for example, though little additional long-haul 
        fiber is needed at this point, there is probably scope for investment 
        in the sophisticated equipment that transmits signals over the fiber, 
        in the "last mile" of fiber network to customers' doorsteps, and in new 
        wireless technologies and their applications. In the quantitatively important 
        computers and software sector, a key factor is the relatively high rate 
        of economic depreciation to which I alluded earlier. Computer equipment 
        purchased before the millennium date change is now four to five years 
        old and may now or soon be in need of replacement. Indeed, investment 
        in high-tech equipment grew at more than 8 percent in real terms in 2002; 
        investments in computers and software led this gain, but even investment 
        in communications contributed a small part. Continued growth in the high-tech 
        equipment sector will be important in any investment recovery. 
      <p>In all likelihood, a continuing overhang exists in nonresidential structures, 
        including some types of industrial structures as well as office buildings. 
        (Prospects for other types of construction, including institutional buildings, 
        utilities, and mining and drilling, appear somewhat better.) Vacancy rates 
        in office buildings remain quite high in most cities, for example, and 
        rents for many types of buildings have been falling. As a result, investment 
        in these types of structures has been declining. Two silver linings to 
        this cloud, though faint and of little comfort to the heavy construction 
        industry, are nevertheless worth pointing out. First, in large part because 
        of improved risk management practices, weakness in the nonresidential 
        real estate sector has not led to increased incidence of nonperforming 
        loans and capital shortages among financial intermediaries, as was the 
        case in some regions in the 1990-91 "capital crunch" episode. Second, 
        relative to real investment in equipment and software, real investment 
        in nonresidential structures has become significantly less important over 
        the past several decades, a development that has reduced the relative 
        importance of fluctuations in this component of investment for changes 
        in real GDP. Investment in commercial aircraft will likely remain highly 
        dependent on the rate at which the airline industry can work out its problems, 
        as well as on potential new risk factors like SARS. 
      <p>Some analysts have pointed to the historically low capacity utilization 
        rates in manufacturing seen in recent years in support of the view that 
        a capital overhang remains an important factor. The importance of these 
        data in projecting economy-wide investment should not be overstated, however. 
        The manufacturing sector accounts for only about 20 percent of aggregate 
        investment, and trend growth in manufacturing investment, moreover, is 
        well below that of aggregate investment; hence, low capacity utilization 
        in manufacturing is not inconsistent with reasonably robust rates of aggregate 
        investment. Indeed, I doubt that a true capital overhang exists or has 
        existed in non-high-tech manufacturing, in the sense of a period of over-investment 
        and misallocation of capital. Low capacity utilization rates in those 
        sectors primarily reflect not an earlier period of over-investment but 
        rather weak current <em>demand</em> for manufacturing output, the product 
        of a variety of cyclical and secular factors, including a strong dollar 
        and weak conditions abroad. Final demand is already taken into account, 
        for example, in the standard neoclassical model of investment, through 
        projections of business output. Indeed, augmenting a standard investment 
        equation to take account of capacity utilization in addition to aggregate 
        output has essentially no effect on the accuracy of the projections from 
        that model. More generally, historically the value of capacity utilization 
        as a predictor of investment has been modest at best. 
      <p><strong>Prospects for 2003 and 2004</strong><br>
        So, to return finally to the question posed by the title of this talk: 
        Will business investment bounce back this year and next? 
      <p>My review of investment-forecasting methodology suggests several complementary 
        ways to go about answering that question. First, one should consider the 
        "fundamental" determinants of investment, the macroeconomic factors that 
        determine the user cost of capital and the demand for business output. 
        Second, one can take a more disaggregated approach and look at various 
        sectors and types of capital to assess their potential for growth. Finally, 
        a complete analysis requires some evidence on the views of managers and 
        analysts about the expected profitability of new investment. Putting these 
        pieces together, though no late-nineties type of boom seems likely, most 
        factors point to a moderate pickup in business investment and economic 
        growth in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. However, even putting aside 
        the possibility of unexpected developments on the geopolitical front or 
        elsewhere, the state of expectations among corporate leaders is an important 
        wild card that must always be considered when forecasting investment. 
      <p>The fundamental factors affecting investment are, as I have indicated, 
        broadly supportive of continuing recovery. The user cost of capital is 
        low and, dominated by continuing reductions in the quality-adjusted prices 
        of high-tech equipment and historically low interest rates, will likely 
        continue to decline. The partial expensing provision passed by the Congress 
        in 2001 provides a significant incentive for firms to purchase equipment 
        and certain types of software before the provision expires in the third 
        quarter of 2004.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a> 
        Under the general heading of financing conditions, favorable factors include 
        the good financial condition of the banking system, improvements in corporate 
        liquidity, and the substantial narrowing of risk spreads in corporate 
        bond markets (though these remain somewhat elevated by historical standards).<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> 
      <p>Potentially favorable, or at least improving, conditions prevail on the 
        output or final demand side of the equation as well. Although many forecasters 
        have marked down their estimates of GDP growth for the full year 2003, 
        most still expect a pickup in the second half of the year and further 
        acceleration in 2004. High productivity, lower oil prices, reduced geopolitical 
        uncertainty, the waning effects of the stock market decline, and stimulative 
        monetary and fiscal policies should all support spending, providing reasonable 
        growth in final demand. However, a negative factor is weak growth abroad. 
      <p>When we disaggregate investment to the sectoral level, what do we find? 
        To begin, I mention the two parts of investment that so far have been 
        omitted from this talk: residential investment and inventory investment. 
        Residential investment was an important engine of growth in 2002, and 
        most forecasters (as evidenced by the Blue Chip survey, for example) expect 
        that it will continue strong in 2003. Inventory investment, by contrast, 
        is generally expected to contribute little in 2003, in contrast to 2002, 
        when this component made a significant net contribution to GDP growth. 
        The risk here is clearly both downside and upside: On the downside, conceivably 
        housing demand may weaken, but on the upside, firms may increase their 
        inventories more than expected if they grow more optimistic about future 
        sales. 
      <p>With respect to the components of business fixed investment, the chance 
        of a quick rebound in investment in nonresidential structures, particularly 
        office buildings and industrial structures, seems slight. However, given 
        the relatively small contribution of this sector to GDP, even continued 
        (but slower) declines in structures investment would be consistent with 
        an overall recovery in investment and GDP. The more critical sector--because 
        of its size--is investment in equipment and software, particularly high-tech 
        equipment. I have noted some grounds for modest optimism, as the high-tech 
        sector already showed growth in 2002. Moderately improved performance 
        for 2003 in high-tech investment, concentrated in a pickup in the second 
        half of the year, seems feasible and consistent with fundamentals, particularly 
        the continued decline in relative prices and growing replacement demand. 
        Finally, some growth later in the year in non-high-tech equipment, excluding 
        perhaps the relatively small aircraft component, is plausible and consistent 
        with a scenario of strengthening overall investment. In short, a sectoral 
        approach suggests that an investment bounceback of moderate proportions 
        is a reasonable expectation. 
      <p>Finally, what about investor and analyst expectations and attitudes? 
        I noted earlier that adding analyst expectations to standard investment 
        equations helps to explain the 2000-02 investment bust, as analysts (presumably 
        reflecting what managers told them) became suddenly more pessimistic in 
        2000. It is interesting that the same exercise has little effect on projections 
        of these augmented equations for 2003-04. In particular, long-term analysts' 
        earning projections appear to be bottoming out, and short-term forecasts 
        are brightening. These trends, if they continue, are consistent with an 
        upturn in investment beginning in the second half of this year. 
      <p>However, when we talk to managers themselves--or talk to the people who 
        talk to the managers--we sometimes get a different story. Clearly, an 
        undercurrent of pessimism has persisted among business leaders for some 
        time now, more so than can be accounted for by what seem to be the generally 
        good fundamentals of the U.S. economy. For policymakers, the most troubling 
        aspect of this pessimism is our inability to ascertain its cause (or causes): 
        Is it geopolitical uncertainty? The aftermath of the accounting scandals 
        of last summer? Concerns about the ultimate profitability of new technologies 
        and products? The depressive side of Keynesian animal spirits? This pessimism 
        does matter, if for no other reason than because it has the potential 
        to become self-fulfilling. For example, high-tech equipment and software 
        will have to play an important part in any investment recovery this year; 
        and as we have seen, this category may be particularly sensitive to management 
        beliefs and expectations. 
      <p>Time will tell how pervasive these downbeat attitudes are and what effects, 
        if any, they will have on investment and the economy. In any case, the 
        clear lesson of recent experience is that forecasting investment requires 
        close attention to the expectations of those responsible for making capital 
        expenditures. Understanding these expectations and their implications 
        is yet another challenge that policymakers must face as we do our best 
        to help the economy toward full recovery.
