    <TD class="Normal"> <P>I want to thank Women in Housing and Finance for sponsoring 
        this conference and providing another opportunity for regulators, bankers, 
        legislators, and other interested parties to discuss the evolving approaches 
        to defining appropriate levels of regulatory capital. I also want to thank 
        you for the opportunity to offer some remarks today. </P>
      <P> In recent speeches, I have focused on the operational-risk aspects of 
        Basel II, as well as the ways that Basel II can contribute to financial 
        stability. Today, I want to review the main reasons for implementing the 
        new framework, offer a brief comment on the recent fourth quantitative 
        impact study (QIS4) exercise, and outline supervisors' efforts to 
        move the process along. Finally, I will discuss where we are in the process 
        of amending Basel I, which will continue to apply to most banks operating 
        in the United States. </P>
      <P> <strong>Reasons for Developing Basel II</strong><br>
        Large, internationally active financial institutions have become more 
        complex in terms of both sophistication of services and business practices, 
        as well as organizational structure. As a result, effective risk management 
        has been evolving to support these innovative financial structures. One 
        often hears that the advanced approaches of Basel II are "too complex" 
        for anyone to understand, and the mathematical formulas in various drafts 
        of the guidance can look like a foreign language to some readers. But 
        I want to emphasize that today, even before Basel II is adopted, we expect 
        banking organizations involved in complex financial instruments already 
        to possess an understanding of advanced risk concepts and to have implemented 
        effective risk-management practices. As prudent supervisors, all the banking 
        agencies require any organization employing sophisticated financial practices 
        or using financial instruments to have a governance structure commensurate 
        with those activities. That is, the bank must have knowledgeable staff 
        to effectively set risk limits and clearly communicate these to executive 
        management and their boards of directors, must have acquired and implemented 
        effective mitigating controls, and must have a robust process for monitoring 
        exposures. </P>
      <P> That is why in the United States we are proposing to require only the 
        largest financial institutions to adopt the advanced approaches of Basel 
        II. These institutions understand that complex operations require a more 
        structured and well-defined risk-management framework to monitor the effectiveness 
        of internal control processes and risk exposures. For these organizations, 
        the incremental cost of adopting Basel II advanced approaches should be 
        relatively modest compared with the significant risk-management investments 
        they have already made. For financial institutions with a simpler organizational 
        structure and less-complex processes and services, a less-sophisticated 
        enterprise-wide risk-management framework is entirely appropriate. For 
        these organizations, the incremental cost of developing advanced Basel 
        II systems can be substantial. These organizations may appropriately choose 
        not to adopt Basel II, especially at the earliest possible date. If they 
        choose to opt in, they may want to implement Basel II later, when they 
        can take advantage of vendor models and databases to assist in the development 
        of their systems at much lower costs. </P>
      <P> In a general sense, Basel II expands advanced risk-management techniques 
        from a set of tools used in an operating and control environment into 
        the basis for making minimum regulatory capital reflective of risk exposures. 
        Since individual organizations employ various types of risk-management 
        techniques, moving to Basel II as a minimum regulatory capital framework 
        requires a certain degree of standardization so that risk measures can 
        be compared across organizations and over time. It is composed of the 
        now-familiar three pillars: Pillar 1, minimum capital requirements; Pillar 
        2, supervisory review; and Pillar 3, market discipline. The framework 
        is structured to be much more risk-sensitive than its predecessor; for 
        example, all commercial loans are not lumped into one risk bucket but 
        are differentiated according to certain indicators of risk. Basel II is 
        designed to address the concern that Basel I regulatory capital ratios 
        are no longer good indicators of risk for our largest institutions. Basel 
        II is intended to close this gap by more directly linking regulatory capital 
        charges to the riskiness of the corresponding assets and thereby reducing 
        the incentives to engage in capital arbitrage.</P>
      <P> Basel II also creates a link between regulatory capital and risk management, 
        especially under the advanced approaches, which are the only ones expected 
        to be applied in the United States. Under these approaches, banks will 
        be required to adopt more formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management 
        procedures and processes. For instance, Basel II establishes standards 
        for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. 
        These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that 
        high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends upon 
        credible data. Enhancements to technological infrastructure--combined 
        with detailed data--will, over time, allow firms to better price exposures 
        and manage risk. The emphasis in the new Accord on improved data standards 
        should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory 
        capital standards, but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices 
        that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. </P>
      <P> The new framework should improve supervisors' ability to understand 
        and monitor the risk taking and capital adequacy of large complex banks, 
        thereby allowing regulators to address emerging problems more proactively. 
        The new framework should also enable supervisors to have much more informed 
        and timely conversations with bankers about their risk profiles, based 
        on the new information flows generated. Our hope is that conversations 
        around this common analytical framework will create a common language 
        for risk management. In the United States, we intend to use the framework 
        to determine whether bankers are indeed able to monitor their own risk-taking 
        and capital positions, placing the onus on bankers to show that they are 
        able to measure, understand, and effectively manage their consolidated 
        risks. </P>
      <P> We expect improved risk management not only through institutions' 
        efforts to calculate minimum regulatory capital in Pillar 1, but also 
        through their development of credible internal capital adequacy processes 
        as required by Pillar 2. Each institution must correct for Pillar 1 assumptions 
        that may not apply to that particular bank, for example if the "well 
        diversified" assumption is not met because of geographic or sectoral 
        concentrations. In essence, the bank should determine whether capital 
        levels are appropriate in light of any deviations from Pillar 1 assumptions. 
        We also hope that the added transparency contained in Pillar 3 of Basel 
        II will generate improved market discipline for these large organizations. 
        Market discipline is not possible if counterparties and rating agencies 
        do not have good information about banks' risk positions and the techniques 
        used to manage those positions. Indeed, market participants play a useful 
        role by requiring banks to hold more capital than implied by minimum regulatory 
        capital requirements, or sometimes their own economic capital models, 
        and by demanding additional disclosures about how risks are being managed. 
      </P>
      <P> From the outset of our participation in the development of Basel II, 
        the U.S. agencies have clearly and consistently stated that the final 
        adoption of the new capital rules in the United States would occur only 
        after (1) we had reviewed all public comments and incorporated any needed 
        adjustments to address legitimate concerns and (2) we were satisfied that 
        Basel II was consistent with safe and sound banking in this country. Throughout 
        this process we have stressed that, if we become concerned about the level 
        of overall capital in the banking system or the capital results for individual 
        portfolios, we will seek to modify the framework, including possibly recalibrating 
        the regulatory capital formulas that translate an individual bank's 
        risk parameters into required capital. The agencies' current review 
        and study is consistent with our historical position at Basel.</P>
      <P> <strong>Implementation Efforts in the United States</strong><br>
        The U.S. banking agencies are grateful to the institutions that voluntarily 
        participated in the QIS4 exercise, from which we received valuable information. 
        In a statement issued on April 29, 2005, the U.S. banking agencies indicated 
        that the minimum regulatory capital charges resulting from QIS4 were more 
        variable across institutions and these capital charges dropped more in 
        the aggregate than the agencies had expected. This was the impetus for 
        deciding to delay issuance of our next round of proposals for Basel II. 
        The agencies' reaction to the QIS4 results should signal how seriously 
        we are taking the Basel II effort and how we are striving to implement 
        it correctly. </P>
      <P> These somewhat unexpected results show the continued benefit of conducting 
        periodic quantitative impact studies. They serve as a milestone to help 
        us evaluate progress as we move to Basel II. We now must determine the 
        reasons for the results from QIS4. Were there limits to the QIS4 exercise? 
        Is there a need for adjustments to the Basel framework itself? Do the 
        QIS4 results reflect actual differences in risk among respondents when 
        prior supervisory information suggested more similarity in credit quality? 
        Do the results indicate the various stages of preparedness among participants, 
        especially relating to data availability? None of the participating banks 
        have completed their databases and models for all of their risk areas. 
        In some cases, this created results that could not be relied upon in the 
        implementation of Basel II. For example, for some portfolios, losses reflected 
        only the last year or two of results. Thus, the strong credit performance 
        of recent experience was not balanced by higher losses at other points 
        in the credit cycle. Analysis of the data used in QIS4 is vitally important, 
        because the ultimate success of Basel II will depend on the quantity and 
        quality of data that banks have to use as inputs to the framework. And 
        as I noted before, these data are fundamental to the proper management 
        of risks at large complex institutions, even outside the realm of regulatory 
        capital. </P>
      <P> Although the agencies have decided to delay the next round of proposals, 
        we remain committed to Basel II. Indeed, we continue to recognize that 
        we must give institutions as much information as possible to help them 
        with their preparations. And we have sought to provide helpful information 
        to institutions as soon as it becomes available--for example, the draft 
        supervisory guidance documents that are now under development. So far, 
        the agencies have issued draft guidance for the advanced measurement approaches 
        for operational risk and certain parts of the internal ratings-based approach 
        for credit risk. Additional draft guidance is expected to be issued for 
        public comment either along with or soon after the notice of proposed 
        rulemaking is released. </p>
<p>
        From the beginning, we intended this guidance to further clarify supervisory 
        expectations for implementation of Basel II in the United States, and 
        it is directed at bankers as well as supervisors. We believe that by outlining 
        what supervisors would expect, the proposed guidance gives banks a far 
        better understanding of how to upgrade their systems, modify their procedures, 
        and strengthen their controls in anticipation of eventual adoption of 
        Basel II. We hope that by clearly communicating expectations, we are giving 
        both bankers and our own examiners sufficient time to prepare for the 
        new framework.</P>
      <P> One vital element of our preparation for implementation has been our 
        dialogue with the banking industry. At many stages along the way, banking 
        organizations--both internationally and domestically--have expressed their 
        concerns about certain aspects of Basel II. When credible evidence and 
        compelling arguments have shown that those concerns are well founded, 
        the agencies and the Basel Committee have modified the proposal. For example, 
        global regulators heard the industry's call for addressing only unexpected 
        loss in the framework; additionally, the approach to securitization was 
        substantially altered on the basis of comments received. We hope it is 
        clear that we are being attentive to the full range of these concerns 
        and will continue to be as the industry raises additional concerns along 
        the way.</P>
      <P> The deliberate process of issuing proposals and hearing public comment 
        on each proposal provides multiple safeguards, helping the agencies move 
        to the final adoption of the new framework in the United States only when 
        doing so is clearly appropriate. In other words, our implementation strategy 
        has been designed to be prudent but also flexible enough to move banks 
        from Basel I to Basel II as their own systems mature and they become able 
        to provide reasonably accurate assessments of their credit and operational 
        risks. The agencies' analysis of and reaction to the QIS4 results 
        show how those safeguards work: we saw results that gave us concern, so 
        we are investigating further before we go to the next stage. Additional, 
        future safeguards--such as the notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process and 
        the minimum one-year parallel run and the minimum two-year transition 
        period, with options to extend either--will also ensure ample opportunity 
        to recalibrate or make other adjustments if necessary.</P>
      <P> <strong>Current Capital Framework</strong><br>
        In looking at the current capital framework, I first want to make clear 
        that I see no reason to replace Basel I for the vast majority of banks 
        here in the United States. Effective risk management and risk-based capital 
        levels must be consistent with the scope and complexity of risk taking 
        in individual organizations. And making appropriate amendments to update 
        the 1988 Accord, as we have been doing periodically over the years, will 
        make the current framework appropriate for most of the banking organizations 
        in the United States.</P>
      <P> But we remain sensitive to the possibility that proposed Basel II rules 
        could have some unintended competitive effects. Accordingly, when we issue 
        the next Basel II proposals we also plan to issue an advance notice of 
        proposed rulemaking to revise current capital rules. U.S. banking regulators 
        have long recognized that the existing capital rules need to be appropriately 
        updated. Naturally, we need to understand the impact of Basel II on organizations 
        that are adopting the new framework before we propose changes to Basel 
        I. That is why we would like to allow the banking community to comment 
        on a combined package of proposed changes.</P>
      <P> While the regulatory capital requirements ultimately produced by Basel 
        II would be, we believe, considerably more risk-sensitive than the current 
        capital regime, this is not the only capital regulation under which U.S. 
        institutions would operate. More than a decade ago, the Congress, as part 
        of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act's prompt- 
        corrective-action (PCA) regime, defined a critically undercapitalized 
        insured depository institution by reference to a minimum tangible-equity-to-asset 
        requirement--a leverage ratio. The agencies have also used other leverage 
        ratios to define other PCA capital categories because experience has suggested 
        that there is no substitute for an adequate equity-to-asset ratio, especially 
        for entities that face the moral hazard that accompanies the safety net. 
        The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is responsible to the 
        Congress for the management of the critical deposit-insurance portion 
        of the safety net, has underlined the importance of that minimum leverage 
        ratio and PCA as part of a prudent supervisory regime. The Federal Reserve 
        concurs with the FDIC's view. As I have mentioned, we need the risk-measurement 
        and risk-management infrastructure and the risk sensitivity of Basel II; 
        but we also need the supplementary assurance of a minimum equity base. 
        The market and the rating agencies will continue to require exactly that 
        kind of base, and a regulatory minimum is prudentially desirable. </P>
      <P> <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        In closing, I would like to underscore that Basel II is not just a capital 
        calculation or a minimum regulatory ratio; it is an ongoing process to 
        help banks implement new technologies and risk-management techniques, 
        to align capital with risks, to foster a level playing field internationally--especially 
        given the increasing integration of banking and financial markets worldwide--and 
        to ensure a capital cushion that is adequate and promotes financial stability. 
        The Basel II framework and the relationships among supervisors and bankers 
        that have helped to advance capital reform should provide a process to 
        encourage bankers and supervisors to adapt their procedures and techniques 
        over time. </P>
      <P> The U.S. banking agencies are working diligently on Basel II implementation. 
        The QIS4 results, however, have given us reason to pause before releasing 
        our next round of proposals. The agencies will continue to provide as 
        much information as possible to help institutions make their decisions 
        about implementation--both those institutions that are required to adopt 
        Basel II and those that may opt in. Throughout the process, our supervisory 
        teams stand ready to discuss Basel II issues with all institutions and 
        answer any questions that arise.
