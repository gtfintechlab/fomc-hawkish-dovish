<P>
I am honored to accept the Eisenhower medal, which symbolizes a program for advancing
leadership around the world.  Such a program and the civil values of understanding and peace that it
espouses stand in stark contrast to the rising level of violence so evident today.  Nonetheless, civil
values continue to prevail.  The resilience of free societies and economies to threats has been most
notable in recent years.</P>

<P>	In the aftermath of the terrorism of September 2001, fears were widespread that
international commerce would contract and the ever-widening globalization of most of the previous
half-century would come to a halt.  And for a short while it did.  Global trade faltered.  Travel
contracted.  New projects were postponed.  But the freeing of markets over the previous
quarter-century had imparted a  flexibility and, hence, a resilience that enabled cross-border
commerce to quickly stabilize and, by early 2002, to resume its expansion.</P>

<P>	Despite the worrisome pockets of strife and destruction, commerce and wealth building
continue apace.  On average, world standards of living are rising, in large part owing to the
increasing embrace of free markets, especially by populous and growing China and India.  Since the
autumn of 2001, global gross domestic product per capita has grown some 5 percent.  Growth in
developing Asia, where so many of the world's poor reside, has been considerably faster.</P>

<P>	Free markets are the antithesis of violence.  They rest not only on voluntary exchange but
also on a necessary condition of voluntary exchange: trust in the word of those with whom we do
business.  To be sure, all market economies require a rule of law to function--laws of contracts,
protection of property rights, and a general protection of citizens from arbitrary actions of the state. 
Yet, if even a small fraction of legally binding transactions required adjudication, our court systems
would be swamped into immobility.</P>

<P>	In practice, in virtually all our transactions, whether with customers or with colleagues, we
rely on the word of those with whom we do business.  If we could not do so, goods and services
could not be exchanged efficiently.  The trillions of dollars of assets that are priced and traded daily
in our financial markets <i>before</i> legal confirmation illustrate the critical role of trust. </P>

<P>	Even when followed to the letter, laws guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required
of business and financial managers.  The rest are governed by whatever personal code of values that
market participants bring to the table.</P>

<P>	Commerce is inhibited if we cannot trust the reliability of counterparties' information and
commitments.  Indeed, the willingness to rely on the word of a stranger is integral to any
sophisticated economy.</P>

<P>	This necessary condition for commerce was particularly evident in freewheeling
nineteenth-century America, where reputation and trust became valued assets.  Throughout much of
that century, laissez-faire reigned in the United States as elsewhere, and caveat emptor was the
prevailing prescription for guarding against wide-open trading practices.  A reputation for honest
dealing was thus particularly valued.  Even those inclined to be less than scrupulous in their private
dealings had to adhere to a more ethical standard in their market transactions, or they risked being
driven out of business.</P>

<P>	To be sure, the history of world business is strewn with Fisks, Goulds, and numerous others
treading on, or over, the edge of legality.  But they were a distinct minority.  If the situation had been
otherwise, nineteenth-century market economies would never have achieved so high a standard of
living.</P>

<P>	Over the past half-century, societies have embraced the protections of the myriad initiatives
that have partially substituted government financial guarantees and implied certifications of integrity
for business reputation.  As a consequence, the value of trust so prominent in the nineteenth century
seemed by the 1990s to be less necessary.</P>

<P>	Most analysts believe that the world is better off as a consequence of these governmental
protections.  But recent corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere have clearly shown
that the plethora of laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human
behavior.</P>

<P>	We should not be surprised then to see a re-emergence in recent years of the value placed
by markets on trust and personal reputation in business practice.  After the revelations of corporate
malfeasance, the market punished the stock prices of those corporations whose behaviors had cast
doubt on the reliability of their reputations.  There is no better antidote for business and financial
transgression.</P>

<P>	Corporate scandals and evidence of fraud and malfeasance notwithstanding, the history of
ever-rising standards of living in a world fearful of violence is extraordinary testimony to the
resilience of free peoples engaged in commerce.  As President Eisenhower opined during the height
of the Cold War, stating a view that remains applicable today, "[W]e now stand in the vestibule of a
vast new technological age--one that, despite its capacity for human destruction, has an equal
capacity to make poverty and human misery obsolete."
