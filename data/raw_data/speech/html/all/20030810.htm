<TABLE WIDTH="600">
  <TR> 
    <TD> <p> Good morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak to the American 
        Bar Association about a subject that has been in the spotlight in the 
        business community the past two years. This morning I would like to make 
        a few remarks about the role that legal counsel and other professionals 
        should play in ensuring effective corporate governance. 
      <p>The problems associated with companies such as Enron, HealthSouth, and 
        WorldCom, to name a few, have caused lawmakers, regulators, managers, 
        and directors to dramatically increase their attention to internal controls, 
        accounting policies, risk management, and corporate governance procedures. 
        At government agencies, a great deal of time and effort has gone into 
        reviewing and clarifying standards of how companies should implement these 
        basic functions. Within industry, corporate leaders have worked to enhance 
        existing controls and procedures to address these areas. Much has been 
        accomplished, but still more needs to be done in today's changing environment. 
      <p>Some of the most high-profile problems reported in the media have caused 
        us to step back and ask, "How did this happen?" We've seen some astonishing 
        corporate governance and internal control breakdowns in companies that 
        exhibited no outward indication of serious problems. In some cases it 
        appears that critical internal controls were treated as very low priorities 
        or simply ignored altogether. 
      <p>In a number of cases, regulatory or law enforcement actions precipitated 
        the very active involvement of rafts of highly capable outside professionals, 
        including auditors, consultants, and attorneys, to investigate and address 
        the identified issues. It is fair to ask why those resources and expertise 
        were absent earlier in the risk-management processes, when more diligent 
        attention to fundamental principles could have helped companies and their 
        shareholders avoid serious reputational and financial harm. 
      <p>I would like to talk about the role the legal community can play in ensuring 
        that the important basic elements of risk management and internal controls 
        are effectively addressed on a proactive basis, rather than after problems 
        arise. First I will describe some problems we have recently seen at financial 
        institutions. Then I will provide a suggested framework for effective 
        internal controls and compliance in the context of good corporate governance. 
        Finally, I will outline some specific enforcement actions we have recently 
        taken that relate to effective legal and reputational risk management. 
      <p><strong>Examples of Some Current Problems at Financial Institutions </strong><br>
        As a member of the Federal Reserve Board and the Chair of the Board's 
        Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs, I've seen several problem 
        situations recently that have been the result of weak internal control 
        environments, poor accounting practices, inadequate corporate governance 
        mechanisms, or less-than-thorough risk-management procedures. 
      <p>Here are some examples of notable recent situations that have come to 
        our attention and in some instances to the attention of the press and 
        the public. These particular fact patterns relate to financial institutions, 
        but the underlying corporate governance issues have wider application. 
      <ul>
        <li> We have seen instances where inadequate anti-money laundering programs 
          permitted criminals to launder funds through banks. The programs had 
          deficient audit and management oversight, and did not receive an appropriate 
          level of compliance and legal review. </li>
        <li> In a couple of cases, failures to segregate duties enabled individuals 
          to commit fraud by entering false information into a bank's books and 
          records or by accessing the general ledger and authorizing fraudulent 
          funds transfers. </li>
        <li> In one case, grossly inadequate management oversight resulted in 
          the operation of a trading program with numerous phony transactions. 
          This extended over a period of years, causing significant financial 
          losses to the financial institution. </li>
        <li> A repeated problem is inadequate management and audit committee oversight 
          of business lines. In one case, this resulted in an institution engaging 
          in transactions with special purpose entities without adequate director 
          knowledge and without effective identification and management of risks. 
        </li>
        <li> Despite apparent approval by outside auditors and lawyers, we have 
          seen transactions that elevated form over substance, transgressed accounting 
          rules, created serious reputational and legal risk for the institution 
          and ultimately resulted in serious sanctions. During the subsequent 
          investigations, moreover, facts surfaced that raised serious questions 
          about the independence of the outside professionals engaged to provide 
          crucial advice. </li>
        <li> Finally, we have seen banking organizations enter into novel, complex 
          financial transactions, driven almost entirely by business line managers, 
          without adequate review by supporting areas and without full consideration 
          of attendant risks. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the course of our review of these situations, we found that the banking 
        organizations subject to the Board's enforcement actions generally had 
        no hesitation in securing the assistance of experienced and qualified 
        counsel to represent them during the discussions with the Board's supervision 
        and enforcement staff. However, that expertise often was apparently not 
        consulted <em>before</em> the problems became so severe that formal, public 
        corrective action became necessary. This failure raises several questions: 
        Did these financial institutions properly utilize their in-house and outside 
        counsel? Did companies' counsel get involved, did they perform poorly, 
        or did management ignore their advice? Alternatively, are current legal 
        standards and practices inadequate to address the types of problems that 
        are now arising in these very important areas? 
      <p>I don't believe there is a single answer that applies in each case, but 
        as a general matter, we may conclude that in each case the institution 
        failed to give risk management the appropriate attention and resources 
        until it was too late to fix the problems without significant financial 
        or reputational damage. Therefore, a clear priority for companies should 
        be to refocus on the basics of internal controls and risk management, 
        and to review how these basics should be applied from the inception of 
        projects rather than in hindsight. I'd like to mention a few principles 
        of good corporate governance that particularly apply to the effective 
        use of professional expertise, whether in-house or independent. 
      <p><strong>Internal Control Fundamentals </strong><br>
        A mainstay of standards on internal controls is the report of the Committee 
        of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) titled <em>Internal Control--Integrated 
        Framework</em>.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a> 
        The report defines internal control as "a process, effected by an entity's 
        board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide 
        reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of…: 
      <ul>
        <li> effectiveness and efficiency of operations, </li>
        <li> reliability of financial reporting, and </li>
        <li> compliance with applicable laws and regulations." </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The COSO model served as the basis for the internal control assessment 
        and reporting requirements that have applied to depository institutions 
        as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act since 
        1991, and that now are broadly applicable to public companies under the 
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
      <p>In July, COSO issued draft guidance on enterprise risk management (ERM), 
        which identifies all of the aspects that should be present in an enterprise 
        risk management framework and describes how they can be implemented. It 
        also identifies the interrelationships between risk and ERM, and the COSO 
        Internal Control framework. The guidance defines enterprise risk management 
        as: 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>…a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management 
          and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, 
          designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and 
          manage risks to be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance 
          regarding the achievement of entity objectives.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As in-house or outside legal counsel, you are one of the "other personnel" 
        referred to in this definition. As such, you will likely be part of the 
        company's team that will implement ERM. I strongly encourage you to become 
        familiar with your role in this process as outlined in the draft guidance. 
        Since the guidance is currently out for a ninety-day comment period, which 
        ends on October 14, 2003, I also encourage you to provide comment to COSO. 
        <a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a> 
      <p>The COSO internal control framework provides a comprehensive approach 
        that is versatile enough to apply to organizations of all sizes and complexity. 
        COSO requires all managers to, at least once a year, step back from their 
        other duties and evaluate risks and controls within their scope of authority. 
        Each manager should consider current and planned operational changes, 
        identify risks, determine appropriate mitigating controls, establish an 
        effective monitoring process, and evaluate the effectiveness of those 
        controls. Managers then should report their assessment up the chain of 
        command to the chief executive officer, with each new level of management 
        in turn considering the risks and controls under its responsibility. The 
        results of this process are ultimately reported to the audit committee 
        of the board of directors. In the case of banks with assets greater than 
        $500 million, management publicly reports on its assessment of the effectiveness 
        of controls over financial reporting and the external auditor is required 
        to attest to this self-assessment--a process that soon will be in place 
        for public companies as well. Thus, the process helps managers communicate 
        among themselves and with the board about the dynamic issues affecting 
        risk exposures, risk appetites, and risk controls throughout the company. 
      <p>Risk assessments such as the one outlined in COSO presumably could also 
        be useful in assessing various lines of business when formulating business 
        strategies. But not all corporations and boards consider risk during their 
        annual strategic planning or other evaluation processes. The 2002 survey 
        of corporate directors conducted jointly by the Institute of Internal 
        Auditors and the National Association of Corporate Directors showed that 
        directors were not focusing on risk management. I was surprised to learn 
        that 45 percent of directors surveyed said their organization did not 
        have a formal enterprise risk-management process--or any other formal 
        method of identifying risk. An additional 19 percent said they were not 
        sure whether their company had a formal process for identifying risks. 
        These percentages indicate that some companies have directors who don't 
        understand their responsibilities as the representatives of shareholders. 
        The shareholders of those companies should be asking the directors how 
        they govern an organization without a good understanding of the risks 
        the company is facing and without knowledge of a systematic approach to 
        identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating excessive risk-taking. 
        I trust that none of the directors who participated in the survey were 
        on the board of a financial services company. 
      <p>Although directors are not expected to understand every nuance of every 
        line of business or to oversee every transaction, they do have responsibility 
        for setting the tone regarding their corporations' risk-taking and establishing 
        an effective monitoring program. They also have responsibility for overseeing 
        the internal control processes, so that they can reasonably expect that 
        their directives will be followed. They are responsible for hiring individuals 
        who have integrity and can exercise sound judgment and are competent. 
        In light of recent events, I might add that directors have a further responsibility 
        for periodically determining whether their initial assessment of management's 
        integrity was correct. 
      <p>The COSO framework and the internal controls annual report process can 
        be effective tools for management and the auditor to communicate risks 
        and control processes to the audit committee. Members of that committee 
        should use the reports to be sure business strategy, changing business 
        processes, management reorganizations, and positioning for future growth 
        are conducted within the context of a sound system of internal controls 
        and governance. The report should identify priorities for strengthening 
        the effectiveness of internal controls. 
      <p>Indeed, beyond legal requirements, boards of directors of all firms should 
        periodically assess the adherence by management, which has stewardship 
        over shareholder resources, to ethical business practices. They should 
        ask, for example: "Are we getting by on technicalities, adhering to the 
        letter but not the spirit of the law? Are we compensating ourselves and 
        others on the basis of contribution, or are we taking advantage of our 
        positions? Would our reputation be tainted if word of our actions became 
        public?" Legal professionals, whether in-house or outside counsel, can 
        help direct management to focus on these kinds of questions. They can 
        also help ensure that processes are in place for employees to raise ethical 
        and compliance concerns in an environment that protects them from retribution 
        from affected managers. 
      <p><strong>Internal Controls Over Compliance </strong><br>
        While much of the public attention around Sarbanes-Oxley focuses on the 
        first two areas of the COSO framework--operations and financial reporting, 
        counsel especially should not forget about the third area, "compliance 
        with applicable laws and regulations." Risk management clearly cannot 
        be effective within a company if we forget about the basics of internal 
        controls. It is worth stating that many of the problems at the heart of 
        those headline cases stemmed from violations of the fundamental tenets 
        of internal control, particularly those pertaining to operational risks. 
        Based on the headlines, it seems that boards of directors, management, 
        auditors, and counsel need a remedial course in Internal Controls 101. 
        As corporations grow larger and more diverse, internal controls become 
        more, not less, important to the ability of management and the board to 
        monitor activity across the company. 
      <p>The basics of internal controls for directors and managers are simple. 
        Directors do not serve full time, so it is important that they establish 
        an annual agenda to focus their attention on the high-risk and emerging-risk 
        areas while ensuring that there are effective preventive or detective 
        controls over the low-risk areas. A board of directors has the responsibility 
        to understand the legal, reputational, and compliance risks facing an 
        organization; legal professionals can assist in identifying those risks, 
        quantifying them, and providing expertise in managing them. 
      <p>Before a company moves into new and higher-risk areas, the boards of 
        directors and management need assurances that the organization's governance 
        practices are sound and effective. Many of the organizations that have 
        seen their reputations tarnished in the past few years have neglected 
        to consider emerging conflicts of interest when the organization adds 
        new products and lines of business. For example, if a customer service 
        or control function must be done in an independent, fiduciary, or unbiased 
        manner relative to other activities, appropriate firewalls must be in 
        place before the product or activity begins. 
      <p>Internal controls and compliance are the responsibility of line managers, 
        who must determine the acceptable level of risk in their line of business 
        and assure themselves that the combination of earnings, capital, and internal 
        controls is sufficient to compensate for the risk exposures. However, 
        supporting functions such as legal, accounting, internal audit, and risk 
        management should independently monitor the control processes to ensure 
        that they are effective and that risks are measured appropriately. The 
        results of these independent reviews should be routinely reported to executive 
        management and boards of directors. Directors should be sufficiently engaged 
        in the process to determine whether these reviews are in fact independent 
        of the operating areas and whether the officers conducting the reviews 
        can speak freely. Where it appears that supporting functions have not 
        been sufficiently involved, directors must demand that management adjust 
        the processes as necessary. If the in-house legal, accounting, or audit 
        staff believes that a supporting function has not been given adequate 
        information or opportunity for consultation, it must bring this deficiency 
        to the attention of the board. 
      <p><strong>Sarbanes-Oxley Act </strong><br>
        Now let's turn to Sarbanes-Oxley. I am not going to dwell on the specifics 
        of the Act. You most likely already know the details of this important 
        piece of legislation including, in particular, the provisions directly 
        affecting attorneys practicing before the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
        What I'd like to focus on is the purpose of the Act. At its core, the 
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a call to return to the basics that we have been 
        discussing. Simply stated, the current status quo for corporate governance 
        is unacceptable and must improve. 
      <p>This message is applicable to both public and private companies alike 
        and affects everyone within a company, as well as outside professionals 
        hired by the company. As in-house or independent counsel you should fulfill 
        your duties with the competence, integrity, and independence expected 
        of members of the bar and be sure that any material concerns that you 
        have concerning the company's conduct are raised to appropriate levels 
        within the organization. 
      <p>On a broader level, the role for legal counsel, in-house and outside, 
        also is to ensure that the client understands the messages of Sarbanes-Oxley 
        and that all areas within a company are taking appropriate steps to fulfill 
        their obligations. To accomplish this task, legal professionals must become 
        engaged in the mechanisms of internal controls, ensure that they receive 
        prompt, comprehensive information from management, and have adequate access 
        to the appropriate level of management and the board to be able to offer 
        useful and timely counsel. 
      <p><strong>The Role of Legal Professionals </strong><br>
        In many recent cases, including the fact patterns I described a little 
        earlier, companies did not take adequate steps to prevent the problem 
        behavior in the first instance, and the companies' accountants, auditors 
        and counsel were not asked to assist, were not able to assist, or were 
        simply not actively engaged in foreseeing, identifying or addressing problems 
        as they developed. 
      <p>As legal representatives to various corporate entities, you are charged 
        with making sure that your clients understand the basic need to put into 
        place strong internal controls, state-of-the art accounting practices, 
        and robust corporate governance systems. You also need to make sure that 
        your clients understand potential corporate and individual liabilities 
        in the event that basic functions are not adequately performed. 
      <p>Professionals such as yourselves can do a number of things to participate 
        in effective corporate governance. When a problem rises to the level of 
        a formal enforcement action, we give institutions a lot of fairly detailed 
        direction on how to improve internal controls and risk management, and 
        professionals generally have a very important role in making these improvements. 
      <p>In some of our recent public actions we have required financial institutions 
        to take steps to ensure that legal and reputational risks are adequately 
        addressed, and these steps all involve or have the potential to involve 
        legal professionals. We have required institutions to establish controls 
        that include the following: 
      <ul>
        <li> a formal policy that addresses tolerance for legal and reputational 
          risks, including regular reassessments of risk tolerance by appropriate 
          senior management; </li>
        <li> procedures for assessing legal and reputational concerns and, where 
          appropriate, escalating them to appropriate levels of senior management; 
        </li>
        <li> transaction approval and monitoring procedures that involve all relevant 
          areas, including legal; and that everyone in the process receive complete 
          information about the transaction, including the counterparty's purpose; 
        </li>
        <li> appropriate due diligence on control processes at the institution's 
          corporate clients, and procedures for addressing any deficiencies in 
          those processes that could result in increased risk exposure for the 
          institution; </li>
        <li> depending on the risk assessment for particular transactions, enhanced 
          review of the overall customer relationship that considers the entire 
          consolidated organization, so that risks are identified and managed 
          on a comprehensive basis and not in silos; and </li>
        <li> procedures to ensure that business lines comply fully with company 
          policy for consulting with or obtaining opinions from outside counsel 
          on particular transactions or client relationships. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These measures provide a few examples of areas where professionals can 
        and should assist their corporate clients. And it is clear that the timing 
        is essential--almost as important as what to do is <em>when</em> to do 
        it. Institutions cannot allow problems to develop to the point where regulators 
        or law enforcement must identify them. Similarly, legal professionals 
        should be proactive, informed, and engaged, and should not confine themselves 
        to a responsive role of addressing problems once they have progressed 
        to a very serious stage. 
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        In today's environment, regulators, lawmakers and shareholders are looking 
        for providers of legal services to be vigilant on behalf of their clients 
        and to ensure that clients receive the best possible assistance in meeting 
        the standards for corporate governance, compliance, internal controls, 
        and legal and reputational risk management. Your clients will be better 
        served if your work reflects the highest professional standards and you 
        take a proactive approach to help them avoid the financial, reputational 
        and other penalties for failures in corporate governance.
