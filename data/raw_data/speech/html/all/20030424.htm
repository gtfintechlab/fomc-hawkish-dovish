  <TR> 
    <TD> <p> In recent years the Congress has responded to industrial difficulties 
        by enacting loan guarantee programs, first for steel and oil and gas, 
        later for airlines and rural television services. Unlike programs passed 
        two or three decades ago on behalf of the Lockheed and Chrysler corporations, 
        these new programs are open to all qualifying companies within the specified 
        industries. Companies can apply for a loan guarantee that covers most 
        of the loan amount, usually in the range of 80 percent to 90 percent. 
        In each of these four new programs, the Congress has created a board to 
        judge the applications, and the boards have in turn hired a staff and 
        outside consultants to analyze these applications and make recommendations 
        on whether the specific applications should be approved. Because the programs 
        involve credit markets, a Federal Reserve Board delegate has been appointed 
        to the loan guarantee boards, and I have been that delegate for each of 
        the four boards. 
      <p>Though political motives undoubtedly are involved in the creation of 
        loan guarantee programs, an economic rationale could be involved as well. 
        Some social value, which private credit markets may undervalue, may exist 
        in keeping alive particular firms or in financing particular services 
        of ongoing firms. For example, a loan applicant might provide essential 
        consumer services, add to competition in certain markets, or employ resources 
        that would otherwise be unemployed in the short run. The supply of credit 
        to an entire industry could at times be temporarily interrupted, through 
        no fault of the industry, as is perceived to have happened for airlines 
        after September 11, 2001. To the extent that keeping alive such services, 
        firms, or firms in such industries has social value--a matter that many 
        economists would view with pronounced skepticism--there could be a rationale 
        for a loan guarantee program to facilitate the supply of the missing credit. 
      <p>Merely stating these possible rationales suggests how difficult it might 
        be to tailor a loan guarantee program to deal with them. Affirmative loan 
        guarantee decisions should be justified either by nonmarket benefits for 
        consumers or producers or by credit market disruptions. Ideally these 
        benefits should outweigh taxpayers' opportunity cost of supplying the 
        funds, called the net credit subsidy cost of the guarantee. Although the 
        temptation will be there, decisions should not be made on the basis of 
        political influence. Given these considerations, it makes sense to empower 
        a board with the ability to sponsor the required analyses and with some 
        insulation from the normal political lobbying process to judge the applications. 
      <p>The Congress in fact did set up these programs and create these boards. 
        We at the Fed did participate in their administration. This talk reports 
        on these four boards, from a personal perspective. I stress that I am 
        speaking for myself and not for congressional decisionmakers, other members 
        of the loan guarantee boards, or the Federal Reserve Board. 
      <p><strong>Rationale</strong><br>
        Economists have a long-standing aversion to intervening in private markets. 
        Politicians sometimes evince just as long-standing a tendency to intervene. 
        The two urges have been in conflict since the early days of government, 
        in areas such as tax subsidies, tariffs, regulatory preferences, and public 
        works spending. 
      <p>Industrial loan guarantees represent a new battleground for such tensions. 
        Economists on their own would rarely see value in such loan guarantee 
        programs, or in industrial subsidies more generally. Politicians might 
        prefer other forms of subsidy, but when industrial difficulties loom in 
        their districts, loan guarantees represent a convenient device for giving 
        aid while still limiting budgetary expenditures. This political reasoning 
        may explain why the Congress has passed so many loan guarantee programs 
        recently, though it cannot explain why loan guarantee programs were rare 
        until recently. 
      <p>A loan guarantee program has potential value if nonmarket benefits are 
        generated by the firms or services kept alive by the guarantee-induced 
        credit extensions. It is important to stress the nonmarket benefits because, 
        presumably, private lenders and investors are already receiving the normal 
        market benefits of credit transactions. These nonmarket benefits will 
        result mainly from, or reside within, the firms or services kept alive 
        by the loan guarantees. Other firms in the industry that do not get guarantees 
        could only be affected indirectly, perhaps through a potential increase 
        in competition. Taxpayers could incur costs for those firms that receive 
        guarantees but later fail. All gains and losses should of course be tallied 
        in a full accounting, but the focus on nonmarket benefits would involve 
        mainly the firms kept alive by the credit subsidy. 
      <p>A board set up to administer a guarantee program might be viewed as trying 
        to find those applications with relatively high nonmarket benefits and 
        relatively low credit-subsidy costs to taxpayers. The methodological approach 
        for doing this is benefit-cost analysis. The board should try to approve 
        applications with positive net social benefits--that is, where the nonmarket 
        benefits of keeping a firm alive outweigh the required credit subsidy 
        costs to taxpayers, along with any other administrative or other costs 
        of the program. 
      <p>As for the nonmarket benefits themselves, the following types of benefits 
        have at least been invoked in congressional discussions of the recent 
        loan guarantee programs:
      <ul>
        <li> Essential consumer services. One example could involve essential 
          air service, or added airline competition, to remote destinations, presumably 
          what the Congress meant by asking the airlines board to consider a "safe, 
          efficient, and viable" air transportation network. Another could involve 
          selected consumer services provided by ongoing firms and financed by 
          loan guarantees, a requirement of the rural television board. <br>
        </li>
        <li> Geographical immobility of labor. Workers may find relocating away 
          from depressed areas to be costly; and in some situations letting loan 
          guarantee programs preserve some industrial jobs in these struggling 
          areas could be cheaper in social terms. These requirements were not 
          written into any of the loan guarantee programs, but substantial pressure 
          is often put on loan guarantee boards to weigh such considerations. 
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Temporary credit dislocations. When an industry suffers a serious 
          unanticipated shock, such as the airline industry did after September 
          11, 2001, there could be temporary financial distortions. There may 
          be cash losses from airline routes temporarily put out of service. Lenders 
          and investors may temporarily find providing credit too risky, even 
          to firms that later prove viable. To implement this rationale, the Congress 
          required the airlines board to find evidence of damage due to September 
          11 events before granting loan guarantees. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mere mention of these possible benefits does not, of course, prove their 
        existence. They will typically be very subjective, with some board members 
        seeing nonmarket benefits for particular applicants and others not seeing 
        them. But if board members agree that nonmarket benefits are not present, 
        the board should have no economic reason to interfere with the normal 
        functioning of private credit markets by approving a loan guarantee. </p>
      <p>On the cost side, the board should try to measure the present-value cost 
        to taxpayers, or net credit subsidy, of the loan guarantee applications. 
        This net credit subsidy is the present-value cost of all expected credit 
        losses less the present value of all collateral, loan fees, stock warrants, 
        and other terms of the loan guarantee deal. In contrast to the subjective 
        nonmarket benefits, the net credit subsidy is usually more easily estimated. 
      </p>
      <p>Loan guarantee applications usually involve significant risk--after all, 
        the riskiness of the prospective loans is an important rationale for the 
        loan guarantee program in the first place. Hence the analysis must be 
        especially sensitive to risk. The applicants must submit valid business 
        plans for the period of the guarantee, usually five to ten years. These 
        business plans must be analyzed under a full range of alternative scenarios 
        for input prices, output prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates, 
        and output demands. Any collateral offered to creditors and to the board 
        should be similarly valued, under a similar range of assumptions. Any 
        stock warrants, or other equity participations, should be valued according 
        to options-pricing formulas. </p>
      <p>The legislation for each of the four boards has been written to make 
        the guarantees partial, so that private creditors take on at least some 
        nonguaranteed risk. Making the guarantees partial ensures that these private 
        creditors will subject the application to their own credit analysis. In 
        effect, the partial guarantee ensures that applications are examined with 
        a second pair of eyes, giving the board an independent assessment of the 
        economic viability of the loan application. </p>
      <p>Exactly how high the net credit subsidy should be is, of course, debatable. 
        Different board members have different tolerances for net credit subsidies. 
        Since an application for loan guarantee has some transactions costs, and 
        could carry some reputational damage, the boards I have served on have 
        seen few loan applications with expected net credit subsidies near zero. 
        Borrowers with no required credit subsidies should be able to draw private 
        credit without any need for a federal guarantee. At the other extreme, 
        as the net credit subsidy rises to, say, 30 percent of the loan amount 
        or more, the implicit probability that the borrower will default gets 
        very high. In this range, claiming a reasonable probability that the loan 
        will be repaid, as is required by the loan guarantee regulations, is difficult. 
        The boards I have served on have been reluctant to approve applications 
        with a high default risk, even in cases with some potential nonmarket 
        benefits. </p>
      <p>The difficult cases have fallen between these two extremes--that is, 
        applications involving low to moderate net credit subsidies and at least 
        some potential nonmarket benefits. In these cases, the borrower would 
        typically not qualify for private credit, but the net social benefits 
        of the application may outweigh the net credit subsidy. These are the 
        cases in which benefit-cost analysis becomes critical and on which the 
        boards have focused their energies. </p>
      <p><strong>Results</strong><br>
        Membership on the four loan guarantee boards has varied (see <a href="#table">table</a>). 
        At this point, the board for rural television services is just getting 
        started, and no applications have been submitted. The oil and gas board 
        operated in 2000 and 2001 and is now closed down. The steel board operated 
        for these same two years and was extended for another two by the Congress. 
        The airline board officially stopped accepting applications at the end 
        of June 2002, but some applications are still being revised and voted 
        on, and other loans are still in the process of closing. </p>
      <p>In aggregate, the four boards were authorized to guarantee up to nearly 
        $13 billion in loans--$500 million for oil and gas, $1 billion for steel 
        and $1.25 billion for rural television. The airlines guarantee law was 
        written differently, with the amount of federal guarantees, not loans, 
        limited to $10 billion. While the three fully-operating loan guarantee 
        boards--oil and gas, steel, and airlines--have approved nearly half the 
        applications they received, for various reasons the dollar amount of guaranteed 
        loans approved has been significantly less than was authorized. At this 
        point, only about 15 percent of the amounts authorized in the three programs 
        has actually been disbursed in the form of loan guarantees, to ten successful 
        applicants. Counting repayment probabilities, anticipated fees, collateral 
        value, and the option value of stock warrants, the ex ante present value 
        of the implicit federal subsidy for the loans that have closed is less 
        than $400 million, though a few more loans and applications are still 
        in the pipeline. </p>
      <p>Reasons for the low participation differ by industry. With oil and gas, 
        the statute limited the program to small borrowers, below the interest 
        level of many banks. Moreover, lenders were required to make the application, 
        on behalf of their borrowers. Then oil prices spiked in 2000, the year 
        when applications were submitted, improving conditions in the industry 
        and making credit more easily available. When this happened many lenders, 
        and their borrowers, withdrew their applications. It made little sense 
        for oil and gas lenders and borrowers to go through the federal procedures, 
        not particularly onerous but not trivial either, to get an unnecessary 
        guarantee. Hence only fifteen completed applications were received, six 
        were approved, and only three small applications closed and were eventually 
        funded. Less than 1 percent of the federal authorization was ultimately 
        used. </p>
      <p>The steel board also accepted applications in 2000, also from the lenders. 
        In this case, eleven completed applications were received; these had the 
        potential for using up most of the federal authorization. Of this total, 
        seven were approved. But shortly after the bulk of the proposals were 
        submitted, the U.S. economy entered a period in which overall output growth 
        slackened and both energy prices and the exchange value of the dollar 
        rose sharply. These factors made for very difficult circumstances for 
        the steel industry. Many lenders, even those sponsoring applications that 
        had been approved by the board, decided that they could not follow through 
        and never closed on their loan applications--testimony to the importance 
        of the second pair of eyes. In the end, only one application closed, covering 
        11 percent of the federal authorization. Unfortunately, this one successful 
        applicant, Geneva Steel, later failed and was forced to liquidate its 
        operations. At this point the federal government has paid the lender the 
        guaranteed portion of the $110 million Geneva Steel loan, but the government 
        is still trying to sell Geneva's collateral assets to recover some of 
        these funds. The estimated <em>ex post</em> loss on this loan is not included 
        in the <em>ex ante</em> federal subsidy cost of $400 million mentioned 
        earlier, though the relevant <em>ex ante</em> amount was included.</p>
      <p> At the close of 2001 the Congress extended the steel program for another 
        two years, with the application period being extended another eighteen 
        months. So far in this extension period, activity has been very slow, 
        with just two new applications, both of which were approved, and one new 
        closing. The new closing raises the total to 15 percent of the federal 
        authorization, and this tally could go as high as 40 percent if the last 
        approved application closes. More than thirty other steel companies have 
        gone into bankruptcy proceedings over the last five years. If there are 
        further steel applications--increasingly unlikely as the deadline approaches--they 
        will probably be in connection with chapter 11 bankruptcy restructurings 
        designed to make the steel firms viable. </p>
      <p>The loan guarantee program for airlines is far and away the largest, 
        and it has generated far and away the most publicity and controversy. 
        The program was passed in response to the terrorist attacks of September 
        11, 2001, and the board was open for applications through the end of June 
        2002. With this program the applications were to be made by the airlines, 
        not the lenders. Despite the enormous publicity surrounding the program, 
        only sixteen domestic air carriers decided to apply; only three of the 
        largest eight. There were rumors that the nonapplicants were dissuaded 
        by the terms demanded by the loan guarantee board--high fees and stock 
        warrants. </p>
      <p>The applications had the potential for using up 36 percent of the federal 
        authorization. At this point, seven applications have been approved with 
        two more pending. Five loans have closed, using up 15 percent of the guarantee 
        authorization. Of the large airlines, applications from America West and 
        US Airways have been approved and have closed, but the application from 
        United Airlines was not approved. United filed for chapter 11 shortly 
        after its application was not approved, and it could revise its application 
        as it emerges from bankruptcy. </p>
      <p>The low participation rates have different rationales, but they probably 
        all suggest a common message. When all is said and done, it turns out 
        to be difficult to produce an application that appeals simultaneously 
        to the borrower and to the lender and yet still satisfies the rigorous 
        legislative requirements and the board's interpretation of these requirements. 
        In the case of oil and gas, the borrowers generally decided that they 
        were not interested--they could get credit on reasonable terms without 
        any federal guarantee. For steel, generally the lenders lost interest, 
        in many cases after the board had approved the application. For airlines, 
        few of the large ones even applied. </p>
      <p>Overall, slightly less than half of the completed applications received 
        by the boards were approved, and 40 percent of those eventually closed. 
        Hence there was proportionately more attrition <em>after</em> the board 
        approval decision than before. </p>
      <p><strong>Lessons</strong><br>
        This brief experience with loan guarantee boards suggests several important 
        lessons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Loan guarantee programs cannot save failing industries. Enthusiastic 
          proponents of loan guarantee programs seem to believe that improved 
          access to credit markets is the cure for entrenched industrial problems. 
          But often the lack of access to credit markets is itself caused by serious 
          industrial difficulties. If the business plan of an applicant just cannot 
          be made to show a profit under reasonable economic assumptions, private 
          lenders are unlikely to be interested in making new loans. If the application 
          involves a high net credit subsidy and a low prospect of repayment, 
          the loan guarantee board is unlikely to be interested in extending a 
          guarantee. Hence, sensibly administered loan guarantee programs may 
          not result in much lending activity, may not forestall many bankruptcies, 
          and are unlikely to save sick firms or industries. <br>
        </li>
        <li> Loan guarantee boards are not good vehicles for dealing with immediate 
          emergencies. Loan guarantee boards have been given fiduciary constraints 
          and must analyze proposals carefully. The thoroughness of the evaluations 
          that loan guarantee boards and private lenders must undertake means 
          that decisions cannot be made quickly. If an immediate emergency looms 
          for an industry, loan guarantees are unlikely to be dispensed rapidly 
          enough to deal with the emergency. <br>
        </li>
        <li> Lower rhetoric about loan guarantee boards is in order. When the 
          loan guarantees were first passed, many supporters viewed them as salvations 
          for the industry, and many in the opposition felt that the future of 
          market capitalism was gravely threatened. Neither stance is realistic. 
          On the one side, as just mentioned, loan guarantees cannot be salvations 
          if the underlying industry economics are not favorable. Credit access 
          alone cannot cure many industrial difficulties, the second pair of eyes 
          limits private lender participation, and the fiduciary requirements 
          of the government are rigorous. <br>
          <br>
          On the other side, fiduciary standards and other requirements of the 
          loan guarantee boards do not seem to threaten market capitalism either. 
          Some new lending activity has occurred, and some firms have been kept 
          alive by the guarantees; but in general the number of firms kept alive 
          is small compared with the number that have gone into bankruptcy proceedings 
          without a guarantee. The normal market adjustment processes in the steel 
          and airlines industries do not seem to have been impeded by loan guarantees, 
          though these market adjustments may have been cushioned. <br>
        </li>
        <li> Having independent boards is a sensible approach. The boards I have 
          served on were insulated from the normal lobbying processes. This separation 
          has kept the approval process on an analytical level. The boards have 
          imposed reasonably arduous standards, but certainly not overly arduous 
          standards, and have approved nearly half the total number of applications. 
          More attrition occurred after the board approval process than before. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Of course the board can misuse benefit-cost analysis and mis-estimate 
          critical values. But every decision I have participated in has been 
          based on analytical considerations, and none has later been overturned 
          politically. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        How this overall experience should be assessed is still debatable. The 
        loan guarantee approach might be described as middle-of-the-road--more 
        intrusive than just relying on private lenders to allocate credit but 
        less intrusive than giving industrial handouts or bailouts. The boards 
        have been set up to contain political considerations, and they seem to 
        have been reasonably successful in doing that. They have limited taxpayer 
        costs. They have tried to make decisions on the basis of underlying economics, 
        keeping nonmarket benefits firmly in mind. </p>
      <p>The steel and airline boards have operated at a time of serious difficulties 
        for their respective industries. The boards have not prevented a number 
        of bankruptcy filings in these industries. They do not seem to have impeded 
        normal market adjustment processes, but they may have cushioned these 
        processes. Ten firms have been approved for loan guarantees, and nine 
        of them are still operating. Whether these nine ultimately generate sufficient 
        nonmarket benefits to compensate for their taxpayer costs remains to be 
        seen. </p>
