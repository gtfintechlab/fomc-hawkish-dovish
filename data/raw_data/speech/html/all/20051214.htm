      <strong>Acceptance of honorary degree, New York University, New York, New 
      York</strong><br>
      <b>December 14, 2005</b> 
      <p> President Sexton, Provost McLaughlin, Chairman Lipton, faculty and students, 
        it is for me a day of nostalgia to be back at New York University, especially 
        having the opportunity to again visit with Bob Kavesh--my classmate of 
        so long ago and partner in founding the classical music society at what 
        is now the Stern School. 
      <p>I am most appreciative of the honorary degree you have chosen to bestow 
        upon me, and especially honored to be sharing the platform this afternoon 
        with my good friend Gordon Brown. The Chancellor, as you heard a short 
        while ago, has achieved an exemplary record as steward of the economy 
        of the United Kingdom and, indeed, is without peer among the world’s economic 
        policy makers. 
      <p>Gordon, I would like to thank you in particular for your leadership of 
        the Group of Seven this past year. It has been a challenging year, and 
        your voice and vision have been indispensable to the G-7's efforts to 
        maintain global stability and growth in the face of terrorism, further 
        rises in global oil prices, and protectionist pressures. 
      <p>In the more than fifty-seven years since I received my first degree from 
        this university, I have had a front-row seat in observing the exceptional 
        growth in world living standards. With all that exposure, it was inevitable 
        that I would gain some useful insights into the role of open and competitive 
        markets in engendering the wealth of nations. But it is evident, especially 
        in retrospect, that the thorough grounding in fundamentals that I received 
        at this university was an essential preparation. 
      <p>The resilience of open and competitive markets was particularly in evidence 
        in the aftermath of the terrorism of September 2001. Fears were widespread 
        that a contraction of international commerce would halt the widening globalization 
        of most of the previous half-century. And, for a short while, these fears 
        were realized. Global trade faltered. Travel contracted. New projects 
        were postponed. But the freeing of markets over the previous quarter-century 
        had imparted a flexibility that enabled cross-border commerce to quickly 
        stabilize and, by early 2002, to resume its expansion. 
      <p>Despite worrisome pockets of violence and destruction, commerce and wealth-building 
        continues apace. On average, world standards of living are rising, in 
        large part because of the widening embrace of competitive free markets, 
        especially by populous and growing China and India. Since the autumn of 
        2001, global gross domestic product per capita has grown more than 8 percent. 
        And growth in developing Asia, where so many of the world’s poor reside, 
        has been considerably faster. 
      <p>Open and free markets are the antithesis of violence. They rest not only 
        on voluntary exchange but also on a necessary condition of voluntary exchange: 
        trust in the word of those with whom we do business. To be sure, all market 
        economies require a rule of law to function--laws of contracts, protection 
        of property rights, and a general protection of citizens from arbitrary 
        actions of the state. Yet, if even a small fraction of legally binding 
        transactions required adjudication, our court systems would be swamped 
        and immobilized. 
      <p>In practice, in virtually all our transactions, whether with customers 
        or with colleagues, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. 
        If we could not do so, goods and services could not be exchanged efficiently. 
        The trillions of dollars of assets that are priced and traded daily in 
        our financial markets <em>before</em> legal confirmation illustrates the 
        critical role of trust. Even when the law is followed to the letter, appeals 
        to legal authority guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required 
        of business and financial managers. The rest are governed by whatever 
        personal code of values that market participants bring to the table. Commerce 
        is inhibited if we cannot trust the reliability of counterparties' commitments. 
        Indeed, the willingness to rely on the word of a stranger is integral 
        to any sophisticated economy. 
      <p>This necessary condition for commerce was particularly evident in freewheeling 
        nineteenth-century America, where reputation and trust became valued assets. 
        Throughout much of that century, laissez-faire reigned in the United States 
        as elsewhere, and caveat emptor was the prevailing prescription for guarding 
        against wide-open trading practices. A reputation for honest dealing was 
        thus particularly valued. Even those inclined to be less than scrupulous 
        in their private dealings had to adhere to a more ethical standard in 
        their market transactions, or they risked being driven out of business. 
      <p>To be sure, the history of world business is strewn with Fisks, Goulds, 
        and numerous others treading on, or over, the edge of legality. But they 
        were a distinct minority. If the situation had been otherwise, nineteenth-century 
        market economies would never have achieved so high a standard of living. 
      <p>Over the past half-century, societies have embraced the protections of 
        the myriad initiatives that have partially substituted government financial 
        guarantees and implied certifications of integrity for business reputation. 
        As a consequence, the value of trust so prominent in the nineteenth century 
        seemed by the 1990s to be less necessary. 
      <p>Most analysts believe that the world is better off as a consequence of 
        these governmental protections. But corporate scandals in the United States 
        and elsewhere have clearly shown that the plethora of laws of the past 
        century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior. 
      <p>We should not be surprised, then, to see a reemergence in recent years 
        of the value placed by markets on trust and personal reputation in business 
        practice. After the recent revelations of corporate malfeasance, the market 
        punished the stock prices of those corporations whose behavior had cast 
        doubt on the reliability of their reputations. There may be no better 
        antidote for business and financial transgression. 
      <p>Corporate scandals and evidence of fraud and malfeasance notwithstanding, 
        the history of rising standards of living in a world fearful of violence 
        is extraordinary testimony to the resilience of free peoples engaged in 
        commerce. 
      <p>Our system works fundamentally on trust and individual fair dealing. 
        We need only look around today’s world to appreciate the value of these 
        traits and the consequences of their absence. While market economies have 
        achieved much in this regard, more remains to be done. 
      <p>Prejudice of whatever stripe is unworthy of a society built on individual 
        merit. A free-market capitalist system cannot operate effectively unless 
        all participants in the economy have the opportunity to achieve their 
        best. If we succeed in opening up opportunities to everyone, the affluence 
        within our borders will almost surely become more equally distributed. 
        Of even greater import, all people will come to recognize that they are 
        part of a system that is fair and worthy of support. 
      <p align="center"><strong>* * * </strong>
      <p>America’s founding fathers, whose thought had deep roots in the concepts 
        of the British and Scottish enlightenments, bestowed upon us a system 
        of government and a culture of enterprise that have propelled the United 
        States to the greatest material prosperity the world has ever experienced. 
        Today’s students, both here at NYU and throughout our country, are carrying 
        forward those traditions. I know they will improve upon this inheritance 
        of democratic government and free markets in ways that we have yet to 
        imagine. </TD>
