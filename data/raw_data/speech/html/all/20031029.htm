      <P><B>Introduction</B><BR>It is a pleasure to be with you this morning and 
      to add my welcome to this very important conference on the payments system 
      being hosted by the Federal Reserve's Payments System Development 
      Committee. The name of the conference--<I>The Payments System in 
      Transition</I>--captures not only the state of the financial services that 
      we all use to make payments, but also the expectations of many payments 
      system participants as they look to the future. 
      <P>Decades of incremental change have had significant cumulative effects 
      on both our check and electronic payments systems. Recent data show that 
      the number of checks written in the United States began to decline in the 
      mid-1990s. In contrast, electronic payments, particularly debit cards and 
      automated clearinghouse (ACH ) transactions, have grown substantially and 
      now total about 40 billion per year. Overall, the number of electronic 
      payments has increased almost fivefold in two decades and, this year or 
      next, may well exceed the number of checks written. 
      <P>During the past few weeks, after substantial work by Congress and the 
      financial industry, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, popularly 
      known as the Check 21 Act, was passed. The new law was signed yesterday by 
      the President and will become effective next October. Passage of this 
      greatly anticipated statute is an important event for the financial 
      industry. In preparing for the new law, the industry has begun to discuss 
      the types of check products and services it will provide to the public as 
      the infrastructure and rules for clearing and settling checks evolve. 
      <P>Against this background of a system in transition, the participants in 
      this conference will be debating the future of the products, services, and 
      infrastructure that support our broad and heterogeneous national payments 
      system. I hope we will all be enriched by this discussion and take home 
      ideas that will help shape the thinking of users of the payments system, 
      suppliers of payments and financial services, and public authorities, as 
      they all work to improve and modernize the payments system over the next 
      few years. 
      <P><B>Historical Perspective</B><BR>For most of the post-World War II 
      period, cash and checks have been the predominant instruments for making 
      retail and commercial payments in the United States. Public confidence in 
      these instruments and their usefulness for conducting transactions was 
      built up over a long period of time, which spanned national debates about 
      the proper instruments and institutions to support a sound national 
      monetary system. A very large infrastructure for handling these paper 
      instruments has been developed and maintained by the private and public 
      sectors. In the case of checks, for example, this infrastructure includes 
      offices, equipment, and staff for rapidly processing, shipping, and 
      presenting checks throughout the country, literally overnight. 
      <P>The foundation of much of the current payments system infrastructure 
      was laid in the 1960s. At that time, a paperwork crisis was overwhelming 
      the financial markets, as the rapid growth in financial activity outpaced 
      the system's ability to clear and settle financial transactions and 
      payments using traditional, manual processes. The response of both the 
      financial industry and government was twofold. Automation was applied to 
      paper-based clearing activities. In addition, new electronic systems for 
      creating transactions and making payments were established where this 
      seemed practical. In the payments arena, the ACH and bank credit card 
      systems and the beginnings of debit card systems date from this era. 
      Reacting to these developments and new systems, commentators of the time 
      predicted the advent of the "cashless" and "checkless" society. We know 
      the history of these predictions. 
      <P>In reality, the 1970s saw a burst of creativity in the establishment of 
      electronic payments systems but a relatively slow rate of adoption by 
      consumers and businesses. More recently, the 1990s saw a new burst of 
      creativity, including ideas for creating products called "electronic cash" 
      and "electronic checks," adapting existing forms of payment to the 
      Internet, and experimenting with entirely new payments systems. Work also 
      began on projects to convert checks to ACH or other electronic payments, 
      at the point of sale or at lockboxes, to reduce the costs of processing 
      and to speed the collection of funds. Some of the results of these 
      experiments are now gaining increasing acceptance in the marketplace. Many 
      more have not succeeded. Many lessons have been learned from these 
      experiences, and I am sure you will be discussing them during the next two 
      days. 
      <P>It would be easy to dismiss the experiments and predictions from the 
      1990s about change in the payments system as hyperbole reminiscent of the 
      1970s. I believe, however, that the situations today and in the 1970s are 
      very different. First, although data on the use of cash in transactions is 
      notoriously poor, the nominal value of per capita holdings of 
      small-denomination bank notes--those used heavily in domestic commerce--is 
      now growing very slowly, and the inflation-adjusted per capita value has 
      recently declined somewhat. More important for this audience, data from 
      surveys conducted for the Federal Reserve show that the use of checks in 
      our society has now begun to decline. Second, data on credit card, debit 
      card, and ACH usage show very strong and sustained growth, to the extent 
      that electronic payments now account for about half of the number of all 
      noncash payments. Third, through the use of electronic payments, retailers 
      and billers are continuing to seek productivity gains and cost reductions 
      in their transactions with consumers. Fourth, data from the Federal 
      Reserve's surveys of consumer finances show that over time households 
      across most age and income categories have been adopting basic electronic 
      payment instruments, although, as might be expected, younger households 
      are in the forefront. Finally, the U.S. government is actively working on 
      new technologies and services to increase the use of electronics in both 
      its payments and collections. Taken together, these factors point to 
      increasing use of electronic payments, when and where economic factors 
      press this outcome. 
      <P><B>Public-policy perspective</B><BR>From the perspective of public 
      policy, the key objectives for the payments system have always been 
      economic efficiency and safety as well as confidence. Indeed, these broad 
      objectives, which include the goals of integrity, security, reliability, 
      and accessibility, have been endorsed by the G-10 central banks as 
      international objectives for major payment systems in key reports 
      published by the Bank for International Settlements and used widely by the 
      International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The challenge is to bring 
      these abstract ideas to bear on particular payments systems issues during 
      this time of transition. 
      <P><I>Efficiency.</I> Turning first to efficiency, in the area of check 
      collection, both the financial industry and the Federal Reserve Banks face 
      classic issues involving the adjustment of infrastructure to declining 
      demand. Moreover, various programs to convert checks to electronic 
      payments at the point of sale or the lockbox, or to truncate checks early 
      in the collection stream, imply that the pace of decline in the volume of 
      paper-check clearings could well accelerate. However, checks also remain a 
      highly convenient payment instrument with a long and tested history; they 
      are unlikely to be completely eliminated as a major payment instrument any 
      time soon. As a result, the financial industry and the Federal Reserve 
      Banks face the prospect of declining demand for paper-check processing, 
      but also significant uncertainty about the extent and timing of the 
      decline. Nevertheless, we know that over time the efficient use of 
      resources will require reductions in excess production and processing 
      capacity as the market demand for checks and check processing declines. 
      <P>In addition to managing resources to meet declining demand, the 
      financial industry is also producing innovations in check clearing and 
      storage centered on the development of digital imaging and the development 
      of archives for these images. 
      <P>The passage of the Check 21 Act is likely to invigorate these efforts 
      and also to encourage a range of new check-clearing techniques that are 
      only now being envisioned. Overall, these changes suggest not only a 
      reduction in the scale of overall check clearing, but also a shift to new 
      technologies and services to meet remaining demand. 
      <P>In passing, I would like to encourage banking organizations to 
      participate in a new survey on check usage that the Federal Reserve will 
      be conducting in 2004--a follow-up to a similar survey conducted in 2001. 
      Improved data on check usage are very important in helping the financial 
      industry and the public adjust smoothly to the changes that are now in 
      process. 
      <P>In the area of electronic payments, the industry faces the opposite 
      challenge from that in check services. Continuing to meet the growth of 
      electronic payment processing with highly reliable service is an obvious 
      priority from a public-policy perspective. However, simply accommodating 
      growth may not be sufficient, and consideration should also be given to 
      meeting the changing needs of the users of these systems. 
      <P>One of the common misconceptions in the analysis of payments systems is 
      that only production or processing costs--that is, conditions of 
      supply--matter from a market or public-policy standpoint. A problem in 
      early predictions of the growth of electronic payments was the lack of 
      attention to the needs of users, including the fact that electronic 
      payments could be quite inconvenient and costly for many purposes. In 
      retrospect, it has taken years of investments in electronic infrastructure 
      at homes and businesses to support the use of electronic payments as a 
      convenient and relatively low-cost alternative to checks. 
      <P>The emphasis in this conference on bringing users of the payments 
      system together with the providers of financial services demonstrates the 
      importance of a balanced approach as we examine challenges for the 
      payments system. A number of these topics illustrate the need to identify 
      the attributes that users value and demand in payments systems--both in 
      current systems and in the next generation of these systems--and to 
      determine how that demand will be met. 
      <P>A particularly important topic is how electronic payments systems can 
      better meet the needs of business users. Business people frequently report 
      that, from their perspective, a payment is only one part of an overall 
      transaction or relationship with a counterparty. Other parts include 
      orders, confirmations, shipping documents, invoices, and a variety of 
      accounting and other information that supports a transaction or 
      relationship. The complexity of this situation has created challenges for 
      businesses as they integrate corporate information systems with electronic 
      payment capabilities, and this complexity has likely slowed the adoption 
      of electronic payments for a wide range of business purposes. I hope this 
      conference will help underscore the need for businesses, financial 
      institutions, technology vendors, and payments system operators to find 
      common approaches and standards for addressing this issue. 
      <P>Turning to questions of infrastructure, I particularly encourage you to 
      discuss ideas for the future design of the core U.S. electronic payments 
      systems, including those of the Federal Reserve. Some of the current 
      designs date back several decades, and significant changes have taken 
      place in both technologies and business needs since that time. The markets 
      will undoubtedly shape the use of payments systems. However, there are 
      only a handful of core systems and it is very important that these systems 
      be well designed so that they do not block market innovation. 
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Payments System Development 
      Committee has over time focused on barriers to such innovation. The 
      overall payments system is built on complex rules, business practices, and 
      technologies. Change can often be difficult. In this situation, structures 
      built up in the past can become barriers to the implementation of new 
      ideas. Where barriers do exist, it is important to address them and, when 
      appropriate, remove them, so that the market can provide us with new and 
      useful payment and financial products and services. 
      <P>From a broad perspective, the Check 21 Act continues the work of our 
      society to ensure that the marketplace can respond flexibly to fundamental 
      shifts in our technologies. The act--appropriately--does not mandate that 
      checks be truncated and turned into electronic payments, nor does it 
      mandate that all payments be made electronically. Instead, it strengthens 
      a market-based approach to innovation in the check-collection system. The 
      act allows depository institutions to take digital images of checks and 
      truncate the original check, provided that they, or a subsequent 
      institution, are also willing to create a substitute paper check if one is 
      demanded, and to bear the liability for doing so. The act essentially 
      removes an important barrier to innovation and frees depository 
      institutions to apply new technologies and market-based ideas to 
      traditional check-clearing activities. 
      <P><I>Safety and confidence.</I> Safety and confidence are the other basic 
      public-policy objectives for payments systems. Sound designs, rules, and 
      risk-management practices promote the safety of payments for users and 
      their financial institutions. Central banks have an ongoing interest in 
      the safety and integrity of payments systems, because they provide the 
      infrastructure for transferring money in the economy. 
      <P>Public confidence in the payments system is a closely related concern. 
      As I noted earlier, confidence in the integrity of our basic paper payment 
      instruments and payments systems was built up over a very long period of 
      time. It is not surprising that society has, at times, been cautious in 
      adopting new payment ideas. Attitudes toward payments systems are often 
      closely linked to attitudes about money, since such systems are the means 
      of transferring money to meet a wide range of obligations. 
      <P>If payments systems do not work well, that can have serious 
      consequences for the wealth, plans, and reputations of many individuals 
      and businesses. In this context, it seems highly likely that prudent users 
      will require new systems to earn confidence with strong evidence that 
      these systems will meet their needs in both normal and exceptional 
      circumstances. As we have seen, the process of building confidence can 
      take years, and most suppliers realize that confidence is an asset to be 
      guarded vigorously. 
      <P>Recently payments systems have faced a number of challenges in the area 
      of risk and risk management. For example, as payments systems such as the 
      ACH have been more widely used to make payments over the telephone and the 
      Internet, fraudulent transactions have reportedly increased. Recent 
      initiatives have apparently improved the situation, but the financial 
      industry has continued to express concerns about fraud and the need to 
      address it. 
      <P>I trust that all conference participants will focus on appropriate 
      future risk designs and risk-management practices. While the risk designs 
      of some large-value payments systems have changed significantly over the 
      past few years, the risk designs for core retail payments systems have 
      changed less. Indeed, some of these designs continue to be based on 
      concepts dating back to the 1970s. Limited change may be the appropriate 
      response. However, past designs and strategies should not themselves 
      become barriers to the development of future payments systems that are 
      more aligned with new forms of commerce and technology. 
      <P>Another important issue in the post-September 11 environment is the 
      degree of resilience of not only our large-value payments systems but also 
      our retail systems. Today, the mix of paper and electronic payment options 
      helps mitigate the risk of disruptions to retail payments in the event of 
      terrorist attacks, power blackouts, telecommunications disruptions, or 
      similar infrastructure problems. As the United States increasingly relies 
      on electronic payments for retail transactions, however, the financial 
      system will increasingly need to ensure confidence in the resilience of 
      these systems in a variety of adverse circumstances. As always, heightened 
      resilience has costs. If, however, high resilience is built into new 
      system designs and technologies as they are developed, it may be possible 
      to mitigate these costs while strengthening our infrastructure. 
      <P><B>Conclusion</B><BR>Over the next two days, you doubtless will be 
      having many very useful discussions. This conference provides an 
      opportunity to address a range of significant topical issues, including 
      the implementation of the Check 21 Act, the direction of the financial 
      industry as it adjusts to lower volumes of checks, and the adoption of new 
      technologies and business practices for electronic check collection. 
      <P>In the area of electronic payments, there will be a variety of views on 
      the development of services, designs, and infrastructure for the next 
      generation of systems. The challenge is both to have vision for the future 
      and to be grounded in the realities of the marketplace. Your insights on 
      these topics will help inform the ideas and actions of both the industry 
      and public authorities during this historic period of the payments system 
      in transition. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
