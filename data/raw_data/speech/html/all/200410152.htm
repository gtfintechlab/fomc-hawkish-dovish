	<p>Owing to the current turmoil in oil markets, a number of analysts have raised the specter of
the world soon running out of oil.  This concern emerges periodically in large measure because of
the inherent uncertainty of estimates of worldwide reserves.  Such episodes of heightened anxiety
about pending depletion date back a century and more.  But, unlike past concerns, the current
situation reflects an increasing fear that existing reserves and productive crude oil capacity have
become subject to potential geopolitical adversity.  These anxieties patently are not frivolous given
the stark realities evident in many areas of the world.</p>
	<p>While there are concerns of seeming inadequate levels of investment to meet expected
rising world demand for oil over coming decades, technology, given a more supportive
environment, is likely to ensure the needed supplies, at least for a very long while.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding the recent paucity of discoveries of new major oil fields, innovation has
proved adequate to meet ever-rising demands for oil.  Increasingly sophisticated techniques have
facilitated far deeper drilling of promising fields, especially offshore, and have significantly increased
the average proportion of oil reserves eventually brought to the surface.  During the past decade,
despite more than 250 billion barrels of oil extracted worldwide, net proved reserves rose in excess
of 100 billion barrels.  That is, gross additions to reserves have significantly exceeded the extraction
of oil the reserves replaced.  Indeed, in fields where, two decades ago, roughly one-third of the oil
in place ultimately could be extracted, almost half appears to be recoverable today.  I exclude from
these calculations the reported vast reserves of so-called unconventional oils such as Canadian tar
sands and Venezuelan heavy oil.</p>
	<p>Gains in proved reserves have been concentrated among OPEC members, though proved
reserves in the United States, for the most part offshore, apparently have risen slightly during the
past five years.  The uptrend in world proved reserves is likely to continue at least for awhile.  Oil
service firms still report significant involvement in reservoir extension and enhancement. 
Nonetheless, growing uncertainties about the long-term security of world oil production, especially
in the Middle East, have been pressing oil prices sharply higher.</p>
	<p>These heightened worries about the reliability of supply have led to a pronounced increase
in the demand to hold larger precautionary inventories of oil.  In addition to the ongoing endeavors
of the oil industry to build inventories, demand from investors who have accumulated large net long
positions in distant oil futures and options is expanding once again.  Such speculative positions are
claims against future oil holdings of oil firms.  Currently, strained capacity has limited the ability of oil
producers to quickly satisfy this markedly increased demand for inventory.</p>
	<p>Adding to the difficulties is the rising consumption of oil, especially in China and India, both
of which are expanding economically in ways that are relatively energy intensive.  Even the recent
notable pickup in OPEC output, by exhausting most of its remaining excess capacity, has only
modestly satisfied overall demand.  Output from producers outside OPEC has also increased
materially, but investment in new producing wells has lagged, limiting growth of production in the
near term.</p>
	<p>Crude oil prices are also being distorted by shortages of capacity to upgrade the higher
sulphur content and heavier grades of crude oil.  Over the years, increasing demand for the
environmentally desirable lighter grades of oil products has pressed refiners to upgrade the heavier
crude oils, which compose more than two-thirds of total world output.  But refiners have been only
partly successful in that effort, judging from the recent extraordinarily large increase in price spreads
between the lighter and heavier crudes.  For example, the spread between the price of West Texas
intermediate (WTI), a light, low-sulphur crude, and Dubai, a benchmark heavier grade, has risen
about $10 per barrel since late August, to an exceptionally high $17 a barrel.  While spot prices for
WTI soared in recent weeks to meet the rising demand for light products, prices of heavier crudes
lagged.</p>
	<p>This temporary partial fragmentation of the crude oil market has clearly pushed gasoline
prices higher than would have been the case were all crudes available to supply the demand for
lighter grades of oil products.  Moreover, gasoline prices are no longer buffered against increasing
crude oil costs as they were during the summer surge in crude oil prices.  Earlier refinery capacity
shortages had augmented gasoline refinery-marketing margins by 20 to 30 cents per gallon.  But
those elevated margins were quickly eroded by competition, thus allowing gasoline prices to
actually fall during the summer months even as crude oil prices remained firm.  That cushion no
longer exists.  Refinery-marketing margins are back to normal and, hence, future gasoline and home
heating oil prices will likely mirror changes in costs of light crude oil.</p>
	<p>With increasing investment in upgrading capacity at refineries, the short-term refinery
problem will be resolved.  More worrisome are the longer-term uncertainties that in recent years
have been boosting prices in distant futures markets for oil.</p>
	<p>Between 1990 and 2000, although spot crude oil prices ranged between $11 and $40 per
barrel for WTI crude, distant futures exhibited little variation around $20 per barrel.  The
presumption was that temporary increases in demand or shortfalls of supply would lead producers,
with sufficient time to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil, or expand reservoir recovery from existing
fields, to raise output by enough to eventually cause prices to fall back to the presumed long-term
marginal cost of extracting oil.  Even an increasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory
environment--an environment that reflects more than a century of draining the more immediately
accessible sources of crude oil--did not seem to weigh significantly on distant price prospects.</p>
	<p>Such long-term price tranquility has faded dramatically over the past four years.  Prices for
delivery in 2010 of light, low-sulphur crude rose to more than $35 per barrel when spot prices
touched near $49 per barrel in late August.  Rising geopolitical concerns about insecure reserves and
the lack of investment to exploit them appear to be the key sources of upward pressure on distant
future prices.  However, the most recent runup in spot prices to nearly $55 per barrel, attributed
largely to the destructive effects of Hurricane Ivan, left the price for delivery in 2010 barely above its
August high.  This suggests that part of the recent rise in spot prices is expected to wash out over the
longer run.</p>
	<p>Should future balances between supply and demand remain precarious, incentives for oil
consumers in developed countries to decrease the oil intensity of their economies will doubtless
continue.  Presumably, similar developments will emerge in the large oil-consuming developing
economies.</p>
	<p>Elevated long-term oil futures prices, if sustained at current levels or higher, would no doubt
alter the extent of, and manner in which, the world consumes oil.  Much of the capital infrastructure
of the United States and elsewhere was built in anticipation of lower real oil prices than currently
prevail or are anticipated for the future.  Unless oil prices fall back, some of the more oil-intensive
parts of our capital stock would lose part of their competitive edge and presumably be displaced,
as was the case following the price increases of the late 1970s.  Those prices reduced the
subsequent oil intensity of the U.S. economy by almost half.  Much of the oil displacement occurred
by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil.  Progress in reducing oil intensity has
continued since then, but at a lessened pace.</p>
                             <p align="center"> * * *</p>
	<p>The extraordinary uncertainties about oil prices of late are reminiscent of the early years of
oil development.  Over the past few decades, crude oil prices have been determined largely by
international market participants, especially OPEC.  But that was not always the case.</p>
	<p>In the early twentieth century, pricing power was firmly in the hands of Americans,
predominately John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil.  Reportedly appalled by the volatility of
crude oil prices in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller endeavored with some
success to control those prices.  After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing power
remained with the United States--first with the U.S. oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad
Commission, which raised allowable output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent
sharp price declines.  Indeed, as late as 1952, U.S. crude oil production (44 percent of which was
in Texas) still accounted for more than half of the world total.  However, that historical role came to
an end in 1971, when excess crude oil capacity in the United States was finally absorbed by rising
demand.</p>
	<p>At that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been resident on the
Gulf coast of Texas, moved to the Persian Gulf.  To capitalize on their newly acquired pricing
power, many producing nations in the Middle East nationalized their oil companies.  But the full
magnitude of their pricing power became evident only in the aftermath of the oil embargo of 1973. 
During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia, rose to more than
$11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per barrel that had been unchanged from 1961 to
1970.  A further surge in oil prices accompanied the Iranian Revolution in 1979.</p>
	<p>The higher prices of the 1970s brought to an abrupt end the extraordinary period of growth
in U.S. oil consumption and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades
immediately following World War II.  Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of petroleum
products rose at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth of real
gross domestic product.  However, between 1973 and 2003, oil consumption grew, on average,
only 1/2 percent per year, far short of the rise in real GDP.</p>
	<p>Although OPEC production quotas have been a significant factor in price determination for
a third of a century, the story since 1973 has been as much about the power of markets as it has
been about power over markets.  The signals provided by market prices have eventually resolved
even the most seemingly insurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply in the
United States.  The gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period
was feared by many to be so large that rationing would be the only practical solution.</p>
	<p>But the resolution did not occur quite that way.  To be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency
standards for cars and light trucks induced slower growth of gasoline demand.  Some observers
argue, however, that, even without government-enforced standards, market forces would have
produced increased fuel efficiency.  Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that
were imported into the United States markets rose throughout the 1970s as the price of oil moved
higher.</p>
	<p>Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher.  Our Department of Energy,
for example, had baseline projections showing prices reaching $60 per barrel--the equivalent of
about twice that in today's prices.</p>
	<p>The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of
markets and the technologies they foster.  Today, despite its recent surge, the average price of
crude oil in real terms is still only three-fifths of the price peak of February 1981.  Moreover, the
impact of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove less consequential to
economic growth and inflation than in the 1970s.  So far this year, the rise in the value of imported
oil--essentially a tax on U.S. residents--has amounted to about 3/4 percent of GDP.  The effects
were far larger in the crises of the 1970s.  But, obviously, the risk of more serious negative
consequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher.</p>
                              <p align="center">* * *</p>
	<p>In summary, much of world oil supplies reside in potentially volatile areas of the world. 
Improving technology is reducing the energy intensity of industrial countries, and presumably recent
oil price increases will accelerate the pace of displacement of energy-intensive production facilities.
If history is any guide, oil will eventually be overtaken by less-costly alternatives well before
conventional oil reserves run out.  Indeed, oil displaced coal despite still vast untapped reserves of
coal, and coal displaced wood without denuding our forest lands.</p>
	<p>Innovation is already altering the power source of motor vehicles, and much research is
directed at reducing gasoline requirements.  At present, gasoline consumption in the United States
alone accounts for 11 percent of world oil production.  Moreover, new technologies to preserve
existing conventional oil reserves and to stabilize oil prices will emerge in the years ahead.  We will
begin the transition to the next major sources of energy perhaps before midcentury as production
from conventional oil reservoirs, according to central tendency scenarios of the Energy Information
Administration, is projected to peak.  In fact, the development and application of new sources of
energy, especially nonconventional oil, is already in train.  Nonetheless, it will take time.  We, and
the rest of the world, doubtless will have to live with the uncertainties of the oil markets for some
time to come.</p>
