	  <strong><em> Receipt of the Truman Medal for Economic Policy</em></strong><br>
      <b>Before the Truman Medal Award and Economics Conference, Kansas City, Missouri</b><br>
	  <b>October 26, 2005</b> 


<p>	I am pleased to be here today and to have the honor of being the first recipient of the
Truman Medal for Economic Policy.  I want to thank the Truman Library Institute for
sponsoring this award and supporting the Truman Library.  The Truman Presidential Library
performs an important public service by promoting scholarly work and presenting the life and
times of President Truman, thereby providing us all with a better basis for addressing today's
challenges.</p>

<p>	The Truman Administration marked a time of dramatic change as World War II ended
and the architecture of the post-war era was put in place.  In the words of Truman biographer
David McCullough, that era was "the watershed time of the century and Truman stands forth
now--especially now in the aftermath of the Cold War--as a figure of utmost importance."<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p>	Within the realm of economic policy, part of Truman's importance derives from the fact
that several key new governmental structures were established during his Administration. 
Among these were the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the Joint Economic
Committee of the Congress (JEC).  These organizations were established by the
Employment Act of 1946, signed by President Truman on February 20.  In my remarks today,
I will discuss the origins of the Employment Act and the history of the CEA and will also reflect
on my time at the Council.</p>

<p>	Two ingredients seem to have been essential precursors of the Employment Act.  The
first was a deep concern that the problem of peacetime unemployment had not been solved. 
Although employment roared back during the war, the memory of the Great Depression was
quite fresh, and considerable uncertainty attended the economic outlook.  Put simply, many
feared that the economy would slip back into depression.  The second element was the
economic thinking of John Maynard Keynes.  Keynes argued that the economy could get stuck
at a point of inadequate aggregate demand and high unemployment and that deficit spending by
the government could provide the stimulus needed to reach and sustain a better equilibrium.</p>

<p>	President Truman's memoirs make clear that both of these strands--the fear of
depression and the view that the government has a role to play in economic
stabilization--influenced his request to the Congress for full employment legislation in the fall of
1945.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>  Of course, the legislative process is full of compromise and can lead to unexpected
outcomes, and according to some observers, the creation of the CEA by the Employment Act
was just such an event.  According to Herb Stein's history of the CEA--he was chairman
during the Nixon Administration--the CEA was an accident that did not need to have
happened.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>  Early drafts of the Employment Act enshrined very specific, and simple-minded,
Keynesian policy prescriptions that worked backward from estimates of full employment to
specific numerical targets for investment and fiscal policy.  Not surprisingly, many in the
Congress opposed such provisions.  In the end, the numerical targets were struck from the act,
and "full employment" became "maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." 
As Stein tells the story, the bill was seen as lacking in substance at this point.  That gap was
filled by creating new processes and institutions--hence, the CEA, the annual <EM>Economic Report
of the President</EM>, and the JEC.  This outcome was indeed fortuitous.</p>

<p>	The CEA consists of a chairman and two other members, all of whom are appointed by
the President and confirmed by the Senate.  In its early years during the Truman Administration,
the CEA was not without controversy.  The two best-known members of the first CEA--the
Chairman, Edwin Nourse, and Leon Keyserling--clashed repeatedly about whether the agency
should just provide private advice to the President or should be a public advocate for the
Administration's economic program.  More broadly, however, the Truman CEA marked a
transition from a relatively ad hoc style of economic policy making to a more institutionalized
and focused process.  The groundwork was laid for an agency that would make lasting
contributions to economic policy making.</p>

<p>	These contributions have taken several forms.  Over the years, the CEA has provided
objective and professional economic advice at the highest levels in the White House. 
Remarkably, this tiny agency has asserted its influence even while filling most of its positions
with economists who were on temporary leave from other professional activities.  A hallmark of
the ethos of the CEA is the pride that its staff members take in providing objective analysis. 
That devotion first and foremost to objectivity has led to the interesting phenomenon that, while
the overall economic views of Administrations have swung widely, the policy advice given by
their successive CEAs has undergone far smaller swings.</p>

<p>	Even though the average tenure among members of the Council and staff economists is
short--often just a year or two--there have been some sources of continuity.  Perhaps the most
remarkable element of continuity has been the service of Catherine Furlong, better known to
her friends and colleagues as "Kitty."  She recently retired after fifty-four years of service, with
her tenure extending back to the earliest years of the agency during the Truman Administration. 
Among other important roles, Kitty was the fact-checker-in-chief at the CEA--an important
position when the stock of the agency depends critically on its credibility.  For Presidents on
down, having your material fact-checked by Kitty meant that you were going to meet the gold
standard of credibility.  The type of continuity she provided is rare in the government and
contributed to the CEA's success over the years.</p>

<p>	Among its contributions, the CEA serves as an in-house research organization that can
assemble, analyze, and present information relevant to an economic decision.  Many of the
members and staff come from research backgrounds and are uniquely positioned to play this
role in the Administration.  Because the CEA has retained its small size over the years, it can be
quick and nimble in ways that are difficult for some larger agencies.</p>

<p>	Moreover, because the CEA is viewed as a neutral agency without ties to any
particular constituency, the CEA often has played an important role on interagency committees
and working groups, ensuring that economic insights are heard at debates about key issues.</p>

<p>	Along those lines, perhaps the most important role of the CEA has been to scuttle many
of the more adventuresome ideas that inevitably bubble up through the machinery of
government.  In every Administration, all sorts of ideas for changes in spending, tax, and
regulatory policy are developed by one agency or another and then circulated within the
Administration.  A few of these ideas are genuinely good.  However, many of them are
ill-advised and not well thought through and fail miserably the test of benefits exceeding costs. 
Often, it falls to the CEA to point out the flaws and derail these ideas.  This role of the CEA is
wholly unheralded--after all, who hears about the idea that never came to fruition--but it serves
as an important check in the policymaking process.</p>

<p>	As I mentioned, economic thinking at the CEA has been marked by important
continuities.  Nevertheless, the evolution of thinking at the CEA over the years has reflected the
economic challenges of each era as well as continuing developments in economic research.  The
ideas of Keynesian stabilization that were an important motivation for the Employment Act
reached their zenith during the Kennedy Administration.  Since that time, the CEA has followed
the economics profession away from a belief that fiscal policy can or should fine-tune the level
of aggregate demand.</p>

<p>	During the 1960s and 1970s, the economy was confronted by rising inflation pressures,
a series of energy shocks, and a slowdown in the underlying pace of productivity growth.  At
the same time, there was considerable ferment within the economics profession, as prevailing
views of the inflation process and of the government's role in economic stabilization were
challenged.  Successive CEAs agonized over these issues and over whether to use the new
ideas emerging from the academy and, if so, how.</p>

<p>	Since the 1980s, the CEA has focused increasingly on understanding the sources of
economic growth and the supply side of the economy.  The focus on international issues, too,
has intensified as trade and international financial flows between the United States and other
countries have grown.  I should also note that, despite its overtly macroeconomic origins, the
CEA has expanded successfully into the realm of microeconomics, particularly issues related to
regulatory policy and market structure.</p>

<p>	Notwithstanding these changes in focus over time, there have been important intellectual
continuities.  In particular, a common theme throughout the CEA's history has been a belief in
the importance of market forces, and this belief stands as an important legacy of the CEA.</p>

<p>	Of course, as chairman of the Council during President Ford's Administration, I was
close to some of these debates and decisions.  I was recruited to serve as chairman of the
Council by President Nixon's economic team.  As it turned out, I was before the Senate
Banking Committee for confirmation the day that President Nixon resigned. President Ford
quickly renominated me, and I began work at the CEA in September 1974.  I was privileged to
serve President Ford, and found him to be a very effective leader.  Parenthetically, there are
some interesting parallels between President Ford and President Truman.  Both were serving as
Vice President and became President rather unexpectedly; both men had had extensive
legislative and budget experience in the Congress; and both men had belief systems anchored
by strong core values.</p>

<p>	During my years at the CEA, the focus of the economic policy team underwent a
number of twists and turns.  In the fall of 1974, inflation was the critical issue.  Some months
later, it became apparent that a recession was under way, and attention turned toward policies
for recovery.  Subsequently, the focus on inflation returned.  It was a challenging time, and we
did not solve all the problems that we confronted.  Nevertheless, I found my time there quite
rewarding and benefited greatly from my work with the other members and with the very highly
skilled staff.  I could recount much about the work of the CEA at that time, but I will only
highlight three themes that recurred during my tenure.</p>

<p>	First, economic modeling is as much art as science.  Economic policy makers face
enormous uncertainty.  Economic models provide a set of useful tools to frame future outcomes;
but as we were reminded repeatedly during our efforts to forecast the economy in 1974 and
1975, models can go off track in myriad ways.  Objective and thorough analysis, as is the norm
at the CEA, is the most effective counterweight to this challenge.</p>

<p>	Second, high-quality and timely data are crucial inputs to the process of making
economic policy.  Because we had access to high-frequency data, we were able to see that the
sharp further downturn in the economy in early 1975 reflected largely an inventory correction
and that final demand was holding up.  That insight provided support for the view that, so long
as final demand was sustained, recovery was imminent.  As it turned out, that was the right call.</p>

<p>	Finally, as hard as this can be to achieve, economic policy should take the long view. 
Although pressures to use the government's tools of economic management to achieve one or
another short-term aim are always present, the tools of government are, in fact, most
appropriately used to create an environment in which private economic activity can flourish over
the longer run.</p>

<p>	As I indicated, the focus of the CEA has changed over the years as the economic
challenges facing the nation have changed.  Through all this history, the CEA has, in most cases,
provided the President with the best economic advice available at the time and has, crucially,
been a consistent advocate for the importance of market forces.  Whether or not all of those
involved in passing the Employment Act and creating the CEA realized it at the time, they
created an enduring agency that has played a significant role in economic policy making. 
President Truman apparently had an inkling.  He noted in his memoirs:</p>

<p><blockquote>Occasionally, as we pore through the pages of history, we are struck by the
fact that some incident, little noted at the time, profoundly affects the whole
subsequent course of events.  I venture the prediction that history, someday,
will so record the enactment of the Employment Act.</blockquote></p>

<p>	I concur with President Truman's assessment.  Indeed, based on a cost-benefit test,
surely the CEA must be one of the most successful government agencies in history.</p>
