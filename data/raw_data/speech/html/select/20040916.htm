<p>Oil shocks have confounded macroeconomists since they first arose on the scene 
        in the 1970s. The oil price spikes of that time clearly had significant 
        macroeconomic implications, representing one of the rare times that higher 
        prices in an individual industry have importantly affected the overall 
        macroeconomy. To account for these effects, structural-model builders 
        had to disaggregate their systems into oil and non-oil, or energy and 
        non-energy, sectors, dealing with effects on both the demand and the supply 
        sides of the economy. The need to make such distinctions has greatly complicated 
        the task of economic-model builders ever since. 
      <p>The challenges are even more pronounced for policymakers--fiscal or monetary. 
        In a world where all shocks are on the demand side, policymaking boils 
        down to finding the optimal balance between inflation and unemployment, 
        or in modern parlance, finding the strategy that hits the optimal point 
        on the frontier relating the variances of inflation and unemployment around 
        their target values. Such an exercise can be quite complicated, building 
        in all sorts of lags and expectation effects; but the basic analytical 
        model has been around for a long time, and the reasoning is familiar. 
        With oil shocks, policymakers are confronted with a new dilemma. Policy 
        must then balance competing objectives in the presence of a shock that 
        normally implies more inflation, more unemployment, or a combination thereof. 
        In this environment, the choices become more difficult, and the public 
        perceptions of how well stabilization policy is doing will inevitably 
        decline. 
      <p>However, it is possible to distinguish between good and bad policy choices, 
        even when no choice looks especially desirable. My remarks address these 
        choices and how to make them. I will first review the evidence on the 
        seriousness of oil shocks for the macroeconomy and then discuss how I 
        think monetary policy should generally respond. I will follow this with 
        a brief discussion of the current situation in the United States. 
      <p><strong>How Serious are Oil Shocks? </strong><br>
        Oil shocks have serious effects on the economy because they immediately 
        raise prices for an important production input--oil--and important consumer 
        goods--gasoline and heating oil. They are also likely to push up prices 
        in other energy markets. These price increases are significant enough 
        that they typically show up as temporary bursts in the overall rate of 
        inflation. They may even get passed through to continuing rates of inflation 
        if they become incorporated into price- and wage-setting behavior. Increases 
        in oil prices also reduce consumer spending power, in much the same way 
        as when a new excise tax is passed along by oil producers. To the extent 
        that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop 
        in domestic demand. Even if the oil producers are domestic, a drop in 
        domestic demand could still occur if the producers do not spend as much 
        of their new income as consumers would have or if they do not recycle 
        their profits to shareholders.
      <p> Estimating the impact of these oil shocks on the real economy can be 
        done in at least two ways. One approach, often associated with James Hamilton, 
        measures the reduced-form correlation between oil price movements and 
        subsequent movements in unemployment, or output gaps.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a> 
        Such an analysis is shown in <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a>, which compares 
        aggregate real oil prices with a measure of the overall output gap.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a> 
      <p>The figure shows that since 1973 every upward spike in real oil prices 
        has been followed by a jump in the output gap. However, some of these 
        jumps seem much larger than can be accounted for by oil prices alone, 
        and there appears not to be a symmetric macro response to downward oil 
        price shocks. But this result is still impressive because most of these 
        oil price shocks have been perceived as temporary, as measured by the 
        difference between the oil spot price and far futures price (discussed 
        further below). Presumably, the macroeconomic impact would have been even 
        more powerful for price shocks that were perceived as permanent. Hamilton 
        and others have run a series of causality tests to these macro data and 
        do find significant causal effects for oil prices. 
      <p>One can also analyze oil price shocks by using structural econometric 
        models. These models would typically build in some sort of price-responsiveness 
        behavior to measure pass-through effects. They would account for the effects 
        of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands 
        of the household sector. They would make similar calculations for business 
        investment, working out the impact of oil prices on the cost of capital 
        and business-cash flows, to the extent that these influence overall investment 
        spending. When one does all this, as many economists are doing these days, 
        one sees effects of about one-third of 1 percent on unemployment and slightly 
        more for core inflation rates for a permanent shock in the price of oil 
        of $10 a barrel.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a> 
        With appropriate transformations, these structural effects appear to be 
        a good bit smaller than the implications of the reduced-form correlations. 
      <p>Why the difference? Many sources of discrepancy between the reduced form 
        effects and the structural effects are possible. One involves consumers--perhaps 
        a serious oil price shock could affect consumers' confidence or spending 
        plans in a way that would not be captured by working out the effect of 
        normal income and price elasticities. Capital investment may also be affected 
        if the oil price shock encourages producers to substitute less-energy-intensive 
        capital for more-energy-intensive capital. Of course, such a substitution 
        will not necessarily lower aggregate demand if it requires <em>more</em> 
        investment demand for new energy-saving equipment. Oil is a pervasive 
        commodity, and other types of non-model effects are possible, but these 
        consumption and investment effects seem the most obvious. 
      <p><strong>How Should Monetary Policy Respond to Oil Price Shocks? </strong><br>
        Monetary policy makers in this country have a dual mandate, to stabilize 
        prices and to maximize sustainable employment in the long run. Their response 
        to oil price increases should focus on these two objectives. 
      <p>At one extreme, monetary policy makers might focus exclusively on the 
        demand-reducing effect of oil shocks and try to stabilize unemployment 
        rates. The risk from this approach is that prices would rise the full 
        amount implied by the shock and would more likely be passed through into 
        further wage and price increases. Continuing inflation rates could bump 
        up the full amount of the initial boost in inflation. The continuing inflationary 
        potential from the oil price shock would, in effect, be maximized. 
      <p>At the other extreme, monetary policy makers could focus exclusively 
        on neutralizing the initial impact of the shock on inflation. Given the 
        initial oil price shock, this approach would entail reducing demand enough 
        to stabilize overall, or core, inflation rates. If prices were at all 
        sluggish in their response to changes in unemployment, this approach could 
        entail large increases in unemployment from the shock. 
      <p>Most observers would choose a policymaking approach somewhere between 
        these two extremes. If, for example, monetary policy makers tried to keep 
        overall nominal income on a steady path, the direct rise in nominal income 
        from the oil price shock would be met by a fall in real income from somewhat 
        higher unemployment. The result would be a temporary rise in both inflation 
        and unemployment. Because the temporary rise in unemployment would damp 
        price pressures, the chances that the initial oil price inflation would 
        pass through into continuing inflation would be reduced. Most likely, 
        the initial inflationary boost would prove temporary, permitting the rise 
        in unemployment to be temporary as well. 
      <p>But nominal income targeting has its own deficiencies. First, since a 
        large share of U.S. oil is imported, a significant difference could exist 
        between the value-added price deflator comprising nominal income and more-appropriate 
        measures of true consumer price inflation. Monetary policy makers would 
        be better off focusing directly on these more-appropriate measures. Second, 
        as before, if prices were highly sensitive to supply shocks but not sensitive 
        to output movements, even nominal income targeting could imply substantial 
        increases in unemployment. 
      <p>A better approach would be to follow a policy rule based directly on 
        target values of unemployment and some appropriate measure of inflation. 
        One example is a Taylor rule, under which monetary policy makers would 
        move the short-term target interest rate--the federal funds rate in the 
        United States--up or down to respond to deviations in core inflation and 
        unemployment from their target values.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> 
        The results would be qualitatively similar to those of the nominal income 
        targeting rule, with a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, 
        though the increases would now be more keyed to underlying monetary policy 
        objectives. Because of the offsetting policy reactions, the real federal 
        funds rate would be likely to remain approximately constant during this 
        chain of events. If it did, the nominal funds rate would first rise and 
        then fall with the inflation rate itself. 
      <p>While not a perfect outcome, this targeted intermediate approach is probably 
        about the best that can be done. Were policy to try to avoid any rise 
        in unemployment, the initial oil price shock might get passed through 
        to continuing inflation. Were policy to try to avoid any rise in inflation, 
        the movement in unemployment would be substantial. The best approach is 
        likely to be to accept some temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, 
        with the increases being based on underlying objectives. The rises would 
        be temporary so long as inflation did not persistently deviate from its 
        long-term price-stability target. But even in this preferred approach, 
        the widely watched nominal federal funds rate would likely rise for a 
        time. 
      <p><strong>Current Events</strong> <br>
        With that backdrop, I will now turn to the current situation. As shown 
        in <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a>, the spot price of oil (solid line) 
        has recently spiked up, as it has several times since 1985.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a> 
        But in contrast to most other oil-price-spike episodes, this time the 
        far futures price of oil--that is, the price for contracts seven years 
        out--has also risen sharply. This correlation seems to indicate that the 
        present oil price increase is not viewed as a purely temporary shock. 
        At the same time, as shown in <a href="#figure3">figure 3</a>, which plots 
        the difference between the spot price and the futures price, the current 
        price is still greater than the far futures price, representing a phenomenon 
        known as backwardation.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a> 
        Because of such backwardation, this oil price shock still seems to have 
        an important temporary component. 
      <p>One question that arises immediately is whether the source of the shock 
        matters. In the 1970s and 1980s, most oil shocks seemed clearly to be 
        on the supply side in that international producers withheld production 
        from the world market, either because of attempts to gain more oil revenue 
        or because of other supply interruptions, such as the Iranian Revolution. 
        Today, the high price of oil is much more likely to be due to demand growth 
        in the United States, China, India, and other countries. Does the source 
        matter when trying to determine how monetary policy should respond? 
      <p>If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, 
        it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent. The high oil 
        prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the 
        system. If the demand growth is foreign, say from China and India, this 
        feedback effect is still present but damped. Even foreign demand for oil 
        might be influenced by reduced demand growth in the United States and 
        its trading partners. It is certainly possible that oil shocks partially 
        motivated by demand may be less permanent than true supply shocks, though 
        that reasoning is contradicted by current-day oil futures prices. This 
        whole issue, however, is new and imperfectly understood. It is not much 
        of a silver lining, but the present price burst might provide some information 
        on the qualitative difference between domestic and international demand 
        and supply shocks. 
      <p>A second question is whether the present shock is large enough to cause 
        macroeconomic ripples. As <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a> shows, even 
        the present high real price of oil is only about half the real price in 
        1980, and the importance of energy in the overall economy is also less 
        than half what it was then. At the same time, <a href="#figure2">figure 
        2</a> suggests that the permanent oil price rise is on the order of $15 
        a barrel. Since the United States now imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil 
        per year, this price rise makes for an effective reduction in domestic 
        income of $68 billion. To the extent that dollars going to domestic oil 
        producers are not fully recycled, the effective demand reduction could 
        be even greater. There could also be important parallel effects in natural 
        gas and other markets. The rise in consumer prices from all these sources, 
        as well as the reduction in aggregate demand, could be noticeable. All 
        things considered, although the present oil shock may not be as significant 
        as the shocks we remember from the 1970s and 1980s, it will definitely 
        register. 
      <p>A final issue involves the initial position of the economy and monetary 
        policy. In the usual exercise, one analyzes the economy in some sort of 
        equilibrium position and posits an oil price shock, which normally results 
        in the temporary increases in inflation and unemployment described earlier. 
        When monetary policy begins with inordinately low nominal interest rates, 
        the reasoning becomes more complicated. Now the response to the oil shock 
        is, in effect, superimposed on any re-equilibration process built in for 
        monetary policy. The ultimate response of the economy will blend the two 
        responses, though not additively because of the complicated nonlinear 
        structure of the economy. 
      <p>The net effect of these factors is difficult to perceive in any more 
        than broad outline. Without the oil shock, policymakers beginning from 
        a period of low interest rates would try to keep the economy on an even 
        growth path as they gradually raised nominal interest rates. With the 
        shocks, nominal rates would still likely follow an upward path, though 
        the economic reactions would be bumpier, with temporary rises in both 
        inflation and unemployment. 
      <p><strong>Conclusion </strong><br>
        As a new economic event of the 1970s, oil price shocks forced monetary 
        policy makers to rethink all their rules and added new chapters to macroeconomic 
        textbooks. Today the question of how to respond to oil price spikes is 
        better understood, but the outcomes are no more pleasant. It is virtually 
        inevitable that shocks will result in some combination of higher inflation 
        and higher unemployment for a time. But I must stress that the worst possible 
        outcome is not these temporary increases in inflation and unemployment. 
        The worst possible outcome is for monetary policy makers to let inflation 
        come loose from its moorings. <br>
