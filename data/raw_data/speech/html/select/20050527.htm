    <TD class="Normal"> <p>Over many decades, the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank 
        have enjoyed a very productive working relationship that has included 
        sharing our concerns and insights about good policy. The sharing has been 
        not only between our two institutions but with the policy and research 
        communities more broadly. This conference is one more such occasion, and 
        I am grateful to the Bundesbank organizers for this opportunity to speak 
        this evening.</p>
      <p> Several of my recent assignments, both at the Board and in international 
        groups, concerned the continuing effects of financial innovation and liberalization 
        on the scope and scale of financial activity around the globe. In fact, 
        in terms of sheer volume, the expansion of financial activity has greatly 
        outstripped economic growth in recent years. With wider and faster access 
        to information, markets have become more precise, on balance, in pricing 
        value and risk. Innovation and liberalization have also brought more diverse 
        opportunities for investors and borrowers, a wider selection of financial 
        instruments, and generally improved risk management. The overall result 
        has been more-efficient use of financial and real resources and, ultimately, 
        better economic performance. Many observers believe that this result has 
        been a key factor in the strong productivity and growth that the United 
        States has realized in recent years.</p>
      <p> Many economies have become more resilient and more capable of withstanding 
        shocks, but financial markets themselves seem to have become more sensitive 
        to real-time data. The past decade has been marked by episodes of financial 
        volatility that have had the potential for trouble at a systemic level. 
        Linkages between financial markets and real economic outcomes have become 
        more complex, periodically presenting policymakers with surprises and 
        puzzles. And, paralleling efforts by central banks at improving transparency 
        of the policy process, heightened scrutiny of policy by markets has added 
        both new benefits and new complexities.</p>
      <p> A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement 
        of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real 
        estate. Because these assets are the most widely held by the general public, 
        price changes, even when not exceptional, can significantly affect the 
        macroeconomy. Rising asset prices support household consumption, whereas 
        falling asset prices damp consumption. In a scenario of collapse, the 
        damage to balance sheets and private wealth could go as far as undermining 
        the soundness of the financial system and threatening stability of the 
        real economy. Apart from such outcomes, policymakers might also take special 
        interest in asset price movements because it has been alleged that badly 
        designed or poorly implemented policy (even if well intended) sometimes 
        has helped feed unsustainable movements in asset prices. Accordingly, 
        I would like to highlight some aspects of the link between monetary conditions 
        and asset prices and point to areas in which the policy community could 
        use further insight from researchers, including perhaps from this distinguished 
        group. I should note, my comments this evening reflect only my views and 
        should not be taken to represent the views of my colleagues on the Board 
        of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. </p>
      <p> <strong>Interaction of Asset Prices and Policy</strong><br>
        Asset price movements that are discontinuous or extreme can affect the 
        policy process in at least two important ways. First, because they are 
        interest-sensitive, asset prices are primary components of the channels 
        by which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy. If these 
        transmission channels are disrupted, the reliability and the effectiveness 
        of policy are degraded. In the worst case, policy's room for maneuver 
        may be narrowed or even severely compromised, and risks of a policy blunder 
        are heightened. Second, because asset prices are forward-looking, they 
        should contain information of value for the policy-setting process. If 
        those signals of market participants' expectations are blurred by 
        extreme movements, important information may be misread or lost. </p>
      <p> Of course, some uncertainty is inevitable and quite manageable in the 
        course of normal policymaking. By virtue of its mandate, the Federal Reserve 
        focuses on price stability, interpreted to mean stability of consumer 
        prices. Monetary policy does not aim at any particular relative price, 
        nor is the mandate thought to refer to prices beyond consumer prices, 
        such as those for assets. Ordinarily, however, asset prices are among 
        the many factors that central bankers assess when we evaluate present 
        economic and financial conditions and the outlook. And when asset prices 
        exhibit large, systematic, and persistent deviations from fundamentals, 
        the implications of those deviations inevitably get more prominence. Clearly 
        central bankers would benefit from a better understanding of asset price 
        movements--particularly more extreme movements--so that we do not mistakenly 
        facilitate in some way potentially harmful outcomes. </p>
      <p> <strong>Liquidity and Asset Prices</strong><br>
        Overly rapid monetary expansion, or excessive liquidity, has been named 
        as a leading suspect in some episodes of unsustainable movements in asset 
        prices. Liquidity is not a precise concept, however. Liquidity could be 
        measured narrowly as central bank money, for example, or more broadly 
        to reflect the multiplier effects of the financial system; sometimes it 
        is measured instead by the level of policy interest rates. All these definitions 
        and others have been in play in the economics profession's analysis 
        of the link between monetary conditions and asset prices. What is meant 
        by "excessive" is even less well defined. Some commentators 
        have taken a circular approach: If monetary conditions were comparatively 
        easy when asset prices experienced a significant swing, then liquidity 
        must have been "excessive." </p>
      <p> A good place to start to unravel some of these issues is to look at 
        the data. The results of research at the Board and that of many others 
        seeking to document a link between liquidity and swings in asset prices 
        has focused on growth rates of broad monetary aggregates and measures 
        of equity and house prices deflated by the price index for personal consumption 
        expenditures.<a href="#fn1" name="f1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
        Using these measures, the results differ significantly according to the 
        type of asset being studied. For equity prices, under various alternative 
        specifications, the link between the growth rate of liquidity and changes 
        in real equity prices at frequencies beyond very short term appears to 
        be tenuous at best.<a href="#fn2" name="f2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
        To illustrate, the <a href="#figure1a" name="fig1a">upper panel 
        of figure 1</a> shows a scatter plot of contemporaneous 
        four-quarter growth rates of M3 and changes in broad measures of equity 
        prices for sixteen industrial countries during roughly the past twenty-five 
        years.<a href="#fn3" name="f3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> As 
        you can see, no obvious sign of a meaningful correlation at this frequency 
        is evident in this pattern. Indeed, the actual correlation is slightly 
        negative. Most other studies--such as the study by Bordo and Wheelock--using 
        a variety of definitions and more-rigorous techniques, support the same 
        conclusion.<a href="#fn4" name="f4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
        The lack of a strong finding of any positive medium- to longer-run relationship, 
        of course, could be because equity prices are quite volatile, making unconditional 
        correlation difficult to identify. Perhaps, too, more-refined measures 
        of liquidity than those used in studies so far are needed to capture possible 
        effects on equity prices. So the effect of money growth on real equity 
        prices is by no means a closed question, and there certainly would be 
        interest in whatever might come from further research on this topic. </p>
      <p> In contrast, the link between monetary growth, as measured by M3, and 
        changes in real house prices appears to be more definite. The <a href="#figure1b" name="fig1b">bottom panel 
        of figure 1</a> shows a similar scatter plot for the same 
        group of countries and periods as in the upper panel, but for changes 
        in real house prices. The two series exhibit a small positive correlation 
        that is statistically significant. Moreover, various tests have shown 
        that the correlation is not just a recent phenomenon or confined to a 
        few countries; it is evident in varying degrees both over time and across 
        our sample of sixteen countries. Again, this finding is consistent with 
        findings from a number of other academic researchers. (I might add that 
        the correlation with real house prices also holds even if M3 is normalized 
        by prices or gross domestic product. Negative correlation between interest 
        rates and house prices is, of course, not unexpected.)</p>
      <p> To explore this relationship further, <a href="#figure2" name="fig2">figure 2</a> provides 
        some background on longer-term movements in house prices in the United 
        States, the United Kingdom, and Japan--three countries where house price 
        movements have been prominent.<a href="#fn5" name="f5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
        As the three panels show, each country's movements in real house prices 
        have experienced two or three cycles during the past thirty-five years, 
        usually with relatively long periods of gains followed by long periods 
        of decline. This suggests that one potentially useful way to explore further 
        the relationship between liquidity and asset prices is to examine movements 
        in those two variables in ten-year windows surrounding house price peaks. 
        The solid line in <a href="#figure3" name="fig3">figure 3</a> shows the average behavior 
        of the growth rate of M3 from twenty quarters before a peak in real house 
        prices until twenty quarters after the peak, where the average is taken 
        across all the cyclical episodes in our broad sample. The broken line 
        in the chart is the log level of real house prices indexed to zero in 
        the peak year. As can be seen from the chart, on average the growth rate 
        of money increases fairly steadily until around two quarters before the 
        peak in real house prices and then drops fairly steadily for ten quarters 
        afterward before recovering somewhat. Although there are some variations, 
        this pattern tends to occur in most countries' episodes.<a href="#fn6" name="f6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
        Importantly, the connection between money growth and house prices does 
        not seem to vary much with the rate of macroeconomic expansion. This statement 
        is underlined by <a href="#figure4" name="fig4">figure 4</a>, which shows as an example 
        actual house prices for the United Kingdom (the broken line) and their 
        forecasted values from an equation based on the growth rate of real broad 
        money and real long-term interest rates over more than twenty years (the 
        solid line). The close correspondence is apparent. </p>
      <p> While these results are suggestive, correlation is by no means causality. 
        Confirming that variations in growth rates of liquidity (especially unusual 
        changes in liquidity growth that could be called excessive) systematically 
        lead to wide swings in real asset prices requires further theoretical 
        investigation and more empirical support. That asset prices rise during 
        a period of monetary easing is not surprising, of course. But why growth 
        of money sometimes might cause housing prices to move more than other 
        asset prices or, for that matter, than goods prices is not clear. Indeed, 
        some elements of causality run in the opposite direction, clouding the 
        underlying relationships. For instance, as the value of collateral rises 
        during a house price boom, the associated expansion of credit typically 
        leads to increases in broad money. The effect can be accentuated by the 
        temporary parking in liquid accounts of the proceeds from the more-frequent 
        turnover and refinancings that often accompany a house price boom. </p>
      <p> Complicating the analysis further, a substantial list of third factors 
        could drive both housing prices and liquidity measures, producing co-movements 
        that look like causality. A productivity shock or a sharp decrease in 
        energy prices, for example, could lead to general economic expansion and 
        rising asset prices while goods prices are not rising. This situation 
        might allow more liquid monetary conditions than would otherwise be the 
        case. Distinguishing the various forces in play obviously requires tools 
        that are finer than simple observations that both liquidity measures and 
        assets prices are moving together.</p>
      <p> <strong>Identification of Unsustainable Movements</strong><br>
        The example cited above also should remind us that not all situations 
        in which asset prices are rising rapidly under seemingly easy monetary 
        conditions are worrisome. Some are quite benign and even signal a healthy 
        economy. Accordingly, for policymakers who have to confront these situations 
        in real time, a fundamental challenge is identification. When asset prices 
        are moving in an unusual manner, is the movement unsustainable; does the 
        pattern arise from excessive liquidity in the market; and will policy 
        be challenged by that combination at some future date? Or are we observing 
        a more complex process, perhaps less aberrant and less prone to a troubling 
        reversal? </p>
      <p> The answers to these questions depend in part on the link between an 
        asset's price and some estimate of its "fundamental" value. Unfortunately, 
        from the point of view of both the analyst and the policymaker, the link 
        between an asset's price and the structure of its return is hard 
        to pin down, as it typically embodies complex factors that are inherently 
        difficult to measure, such as expected future earnings, riskiness, and 
        risk aversion. Consequently, for evaluating in real time whether prices 
        may be "off track" and, if so, by how much, we have to fall back on more 
        readily observable measures that, in principle at least, should bear some 
        systematic relationship to ideal measures and that can be assessed against 
        historical experience. For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio 
        is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation. In the late 1990s, the 
        price-earnings ratio for U.S. equities--especially in the high-tech area--soared 
        to record levels, and the so-called equity risk premium narrowed to a 
        historical low. There was a strong sense at the time that such elevated 
        price levels were unusual, but there was no uniform consensus regarding 
        whether or not they were sustainable. All agreed, however, that the pricing 
        of assets, given profit expectations, was difficult. And even after we 
        have seen a major correction, our understanding of what drove that process 
        and what the proper level should have been--and should be now--still is 
        unsettled.<a href="#fn7" name="f7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>
      <p> For housing, rent-to-price ratios and income-to-price ratios are commonly 
        used measures to assess valuation. Over the past several years, both measures 
        have decreased sharply in many countries, and they currently are well 
        outside historical ranges in some countries. In 2004, U.S. home prices 
        increased 11.2 percent, their fastest pace since 1979, and right now, 
        housing prices in many markets in the United States are relatively high 
        when judged by conventional valuation measures.<a href="#fn8" name="f8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a> To know if housing is 
        fairly valued requires assessing whether today's valuations are 
        consistent with unobservable future rents, interest rates, and returns--concepts 
        for which we have only rough proxies. However, in some markets the most 
        prudent judgment is that the growth of house prices will slow from the 
        rapid pace experienced most recently.</p>
      <p> <strong>Interpretation of Correlation: Other Fundamental Factors</strong><br>
        The issue of identification becomes much more difficult in a changing 
        environment. Some patterns of asset price changes that are attributed 
        to excess liquidity may arise, for example, from financial innovation 
        and other structural changes.<a href="#fn9" name="f9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a> But mapping such changes into asset price 
        movements to control for such factors is difficult. For example, the rise 
        in house prices in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s was thought at 
        the time to relate importantly to the liberalization of U.K. banking laws 
        several years earlier and, therefore, likely to be sustainable. As it 
        turned out, the run-up ended fairly soon and was followed by a steep decline. 
        The inability to more accurately gauge the effects on asset prices conferred 
        (or not) by earlier structural changes likely contributed to the inaccurate 
        expectation that they would last longer. In Sweden, the large and swift 
        increases in property prices in the 1980s also related in part to the 
        earlier liberalization of domestic banking laws and consequent easier 
        lending practices. The tax reform of 1990, which among other things made 
        the tax treatment of mortgage interest rates in Sweden considerably less 
        favorable, contributed to a subsequent drop in property prices that ultimately 
        severely stressed banks' balance sheets, an experience that again 
        highlighted the potential impact of such structural factors on asset price 
        movements.</p>
      <p> Controlling for cyclical effects on both liquidity and real asset prices 
        is basic, of course, in any empirical assessment of how they may be linked. 
        But some observers have conjectured that, beyond conventional cyclical 
        patterns in a benign environment with low-inflation and strong real growth 
        such as we have had in recent years, investors' preferences and 
        behaviors may change qualitatively in ways that are not captured well 
        by models based on historical patterns. Faced with cumulating wealth and 
        lower nominal returns, investors may develop a distinctly greater tolerance 
        for risk that results in aggressive "search for yield" behavior. This 
        behavior may engender, it is argued, a tendency for unusual run-ups in 
        some asset prices. If so, a concern is that changes in the underlying 
        conditions that fostered this pattern or a policy misstep could cause 
        a quick reversion to the historical norm. The policy community has been 
        on the lookout for such patterns of "search for yield" during the latest 
        cycle of low rates and tightening.<a href="#fn10" name="f10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>
      <p> Others have argued that in certain circumstances, when special factors 
        may be preventing inflationary pressures from showing through to consumer 
        prices, increases in asset prices might serve as an early, more visible 
        warning that liquidity is excessive. It has been asserted, for example, 
        that the strength of the yen in the late 1980s stifled Japanese consumer 
        price inflation and contributed to an easier policy stance by the Bank 
        of Japan.<a href="#fn11" name="f11" title="footnote 11"><sup>11</sup></a> The fact that resulting liquidity was greater than would have 
        been ideal was most apparent (unfortunately, more so in retrospect) in 
        Japan's booming asset prices. A sharp (but temporary) boost in productivity 
        or disruption of exchange rate pass-through behavior could have similar 
        masking effects. But whether, in general, asset prices could provide reliable 
        signals of suppressed but impending general inflation is a complex matter, 
        and elevating asset prices to a more prominent role in the policy process 
        is not without a number of potential pitfalls.</p>
      <p> Among other complications is the possibility that financial globalization 
        may be changing the links between liquidity and asset prices. Movements 
        in asset prices across countries now appear to be more synchronized. This 
        synchronization could arise in a number of ways. National business cycles 
        and policy responses may be moving more in tandem just because national 
        economies have become more closely integrated through trade and investment, 
        producing in turn a greater synchronization in asset markets. Global shocks 
        (for example, from oil prices and geopolitical risk factors) that produce 
        broadly similar effects on most economies may have become more prevalent 
        and may tend to dominate idiosyncratic national shocks. But it also is 
        quite possible that greater international diversification of portfolios 
        now allows developments affecting assets in one country to spill over 
        into markets of others--both at the level of particular industries and 
        more broadly. If synchronization of asset price movements comes about 
        mainly in this way, the suggestion is that excess liquidity in one country 
        could move asset prices in another, perhaps significantly, even if liquidity 
        was well contained in the latter.<a href="#fn12" name="f12" title="footnote 12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>
      <p> In the somewhat longer run, patterns of aggregate saving--influenced, 
        for example, by demographic developments--may also affect the path of 
        real interest rates and, in turn, prices of assets, again complicating 
        interpretation of co-movements. For instance, an increase in savings as 
        a growing share of the population nears retirement may reduce real rates 
        and raise asset prices. Patterns of immigration that affect the population's 
        demographic profile, too, can affect asset prices. In the United States, 
        we have seen some of these effects in certain segments of the housing 
        market. </p>
      <p> <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
        In summary, although excess liquidity has been cited as a source of general 
        asset price instability, the support for this conclusion is mixed, at 
        best. We do find a positive correlation between growth rates of real house 
        prices and M3, but the correlation does not seem to hold for real asset 
        prices more generally--including, in particular, equities. In this talk, 
        I have suggested that we are only at the beginning of an understanding 
        of some of these relationships. Even if an underlying causal link exists 
        between some real asset prices and liquidity, many additional factors 
        may be influencing what we see, with potential for misleading us in interpreting 
        simple associations or correlations. The problem obviously is complex. 
        As a start, however, we need a better understanding of how asset prices 
        are determined that can be translated into guidance for a policy process 
        that uses real-time variables. To borrow a turn of phrase cited often 
        in the physical sciences, theory tends to "explain a complex visible, 
        with a simple invisible."<a href="#fn13" name="f13" title="footnote 13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the realm of policy, of course, we need to 
        work with simple, but reliable visibles--a requirement that makes this 
        task all the more challenging. For that reason, I have been pleased to 
        join this group of distinguished economists this evening. </p>
