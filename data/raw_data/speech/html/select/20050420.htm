I would like to
address an issue that is receiving increasing attention lately: the U.S.
current account deficit. Not since joining the Federal Reserve Board have I
seen this topic show up in the financial press as frequently--and so often with
such ominous overtones--as it does these days. Several reasons for this come
to mind. Most obviously, at about 6 percent of gross domestic product, the
current account deficit is now larger than it has ever been in our nation's
history; that, by itself, attracts attention. Also, because the current
account deficit reflects the excess of our country's imports over our exports,
the deficit's descent into record territory has helped crystalize fears that
the economy is losing competitiveness and that U.S. jobs and incomes are
suffering as a result. Finally, the larger the current account deficit
becomes, the greater the number of observers who believe that a correction, and
one with significant implications for the U.S. economy, is imminent. Such
expectations have contributed to, and in turn have been reinforced by, the
slide in the dollar over the past few years.</p>

<p>Although views
differ as to when a correction will take place, nearly all agree that the
current trajectory of the U.S. current account deficit is unsustainable. This
consensus reflects the simple logic that the deficit is causing the net
indebtedness of the U.S. economy to rise more rapidly than U.S. income. In
1985, our foreign assets were about equal to our foreign liabilities, so that
our net international investment position was roughly zero. By 1995, our
investment position had deteriorated to negative 4 percent of GDP, and by 2004,
we estimate this negative position to have reached about one-fourth of GDP. If
current account deficits continue to boost the negative international
investment position, eventually the cost of servicing that position, which so
far has been quite modest, would rise to an unsustainable level. Obviously,
the current account would have to adjust to ensure that excessive debt burdens
are not maintained.</p>

<p>If nearly all
observers agree that an adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit is
inevitable, few agree on when the adjustment will occur and what will cause it
to happen. Many argue that U.S. households must raise to a more prudent level
a saving rate that has fallen to less than 3 percent of disposable income in
recent years. Others place the onus of adjustment on foreign economies to
boost lackluster domestic demand and increase their purchases of U.S. exports.
While some call upon coordinated governmental action to address the pattern of
global external imbalances, others place their faith in market mechanisms to do
the job.</p>

<p>A large part of
the reason that people disagree about what will be needed to bring about
current account adjustment is that they disagree about what has led the deficit
to become so large in the first place. If one believes that the expansion of
the current account deficit has been caused by government policies, such as
budget deficits, then it is natural to identify a reversal of those policies as
the action that will bring about current account adjustment. Conversely, if
the current account deficit primarily reflects developments in the private
sector, it is more likely that the marketplace will be the source of subsequent
correction.</p>

<p>Surprisingly,
researchers have made relatively few attempts to assess and compare the full
range of explanations that have been proposed for the emergence of the large
U.S. external deficit.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a> In my
remarks today, I would like to survey some of the factors that have been put
forward to explain the deficit. As I do so, I will be referring to several
macroeconomic model simulations, implemented by my colleagues on the Federal
Reserve Board's staff, that are designed to gauge the impact of these factors
on the U.S. external imbalance. The proposed causes of the deficit are by no
means mutually exclusive, of course. It is possible and even likely that the
deficit is the outcome of several different developments. I should also note
at the outset that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily
reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. </p>

<p><b>Approaches to Characterizing the Current Account</b><br>
Before getting to
these explanations, however, I'd like to take a few moments to clear up what--for
some, at least--has been a prominent source of confusion. At least
three approaches characterize the current account balance, and each of them
shines the spotlight on different factors that may be influential.</p>

<p>Perhaps most
commonly, the current account balance is portrayed as the difference between a
nation's exports, broadly defined, and its imports. From this perspective, the
determinants of the current account balance are roughly the same as the
determinants of the trade balance: exchange rates, prices, and incomes at home
and abroad. Accordingly, the widening of the U.S. current account deficit is
frequently attributed to the strengthening of the dollar since the mid-1990s,
which led U.S. imports to be cheaper measured in dollars and U.S. exports to be
more expensive in foreign currency. </p>

<p>According to a
second perspective, the current account balance is defined as the difference
between a nation's saving and its investment. This definition highlights the
decline in the ratio of national saving to GDP over the past ten years, even as
investment rates have moved up a bit on balance, as the central cause of the
widening of the U.S. current account deficit.</p>

<p>Finally, because
any excess of national spending over income must be financed by foreigners, the
current account deficit is equivalent to the net inflow of capital from
abroad. This approach points to the surge of capital inflows into our economy
as the key development underlying the emergence of the large external deficit.</p>

<p>These three
approaches--the trade balance, the saving-investment balance, and
net capital inflows--might, at first blush, appear to attribute the emergence
of the large U.S. current account deficit to highly distinct factors. In
reality, however, these approaches are merely three alternative means of
characterizing the outcomes of the same underlying, fundamental developments.
To see this more concretely, consider, for example, the effects of a rise in
investor perceptions of the rate of return on investment in the United States.
The rise will likely attract foreign capital inflows. It may also lead to a
strengthening of the dollar, thereby weakening exports and strengthening
imports. Finally, through various channels, the rise in the perceived rate of
return may boost the investment rate and lower the saving rate. </p>

<p>In this example,
the fundamental shock causing the current account deficit to widen is the
change in investor expectations. The other elements of the story--the
inflow of capital, the strengthening of the dollar, and the movements in saving
and investment rates--represent diverse aspects of the economy as
they respond to that initial shock and lead, ultimately, to the larger
deficit. The story can be played out using any of the three approaches to the
current account that I have reviewed. To be sure, some approaches may be more
helpful in highlighting certain types of shocks than others. But any
compelling explanation of the current account deficit must identify not merely
the proximate influences on the deficit--be they exchange rates,
capital flows, or aggregate saving and investment--but also the
fundamental, underlying sources of the imbalance. </p>

<p>
<b>Explanations for the Large U.S. Current Account Deficit</b><br>
I would like now to address five different explanations for the large
U.S. current account deficit, and even these do not exhaust the possibilities.
The first three explanations focus primarily on domestic developments: the
fiscal deficit, an autonomous drop-off in private saving rates, and the surge
in productivity growth. The remaining explanations encompass developments
abroad as well: the slowdown in foreign demand and the apparent rise in global
financial intermediation. I will not discuss yet another factor that
undoubtedly has contributed to the widening of the deficit--the
rise in oil prices--but it is worth noting that our oil import bill
has risen by about $110 billion, from $68 billion in 1999 to $180 billion in
2004, and most of this increase reflects higher oil prices.</p>

<p><i>1. Expansion of the fiscal deficit</i></p>

<p>The view that the
current account deficit arises from the widening U.S. budget deficit has
received considerable attention of late and recalls the discussion of the
mid-1980s, when the simultaneous emergence of fiscal and current account
deficits in the United States gave rise to the "twin deficits"
hypothesis. The simplest version of this hypothesis starts with the identity
that the current account balance is equal to saving minus investment. Since
the expansion of the fiscal deficit lowered public saving, the story runs, it
must have lowered national saving and thus widened the current account balance
to a similar extent. This version of the story is a bit too simple, however,
as it assumes that private saving and investment remain constant, whereas in
reality these quantities can and probably will change in response to a change
in the fiscal balance. In the more sophisticated version of the story, a
larger fiscal deficit boosts domestic demand, pushing up domestic interest
rates relative to foreign rates; this, in turn, attracts investors and raises
the value of the dollar, thereby leading to a larger current account deficit.</p>

<p>In theory, the
fiscal explanation of the current account deficit is entirely plausible. In
practice, however, the support for this proposition is weak. The United States
has had episodes in which the fiscal and current account balances moved
together, but it has also had episodes in which they diverged. Most notably,
the fiscal factor cannot explain the widening of the trade deficit in the late
1990s, when the U.S. budget moved into surplus. At the international level,
countries such as Japan and Germany are running large current account surpluses
even as their budget balances are substantially in deficit. More generally,
research into the determinants of current account balances has produced only
mixed support for the linkage between fiscal and current account deficits.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a></p>

<p>Why don't the
reductions in public saving associated with widening fiscal deficits lead more
consistently to higher current account deficits? Most likely, larger budget
deficits increase the government's draw on available credit and dampen private
consumption and investment spending, thereby limiting the deterioration of the
current account. This explanation is supported by a simulation of the Federal
Reserve Board staff's macroeconomic model, to which I alluded earlier. The
results of this simulation, depicted in <a href="#fig_1" name="fig1">figure 1</a>, suggest that, compared with a
scenario in which no fiscal expansion had taken place, the loosening of fiscal
policy since 2001 boosted the rate of private saving and lowered the rate of
private investment. Accordingly, the effect on the trade deficit is estimated
to have been fairly small.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a> Rather than
crowding out net exports, fiscal expansion appears to have primarily crowded
out private investment and consumption.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a></p>

<p>In sum, the recent
experience both of the United States and of other countries, as well as the
results of model simulations, lead me to conclude that the budget deficit has
probably been only a small factor in the emergence of the large U.S. external
imbalance. Of course, even if it does not narrow the current account deficit
by much, reducing the budget deficit would be highly desirable for other
reasons: It would free up resources for private investment, and it would reduce
the burden on future taxpayers of repaying the federal debt. </p>

<p><i>2. Decline in the private saving rate </i></p>

<p>For observers who
view the large current account deficit as an example of the profligacy of
Americans, the sharp decline in private saving rates looms as large in their
thinking as the sharp rise in the budget deficit. Since the mid-1990s, the
personal saving rate has declined from roughly 5 percent of disposable income
to less than 2 percent, and gross private saving (which includes corporate
saving) has edged down from about 16 percent of GDP to less than 15 percent.</p>

<p>As I noted
earlier, it is important to distinguish between fundamental shocks affecting
the current account and other developments which might merely represent
economic responses to those shocks. On one hand, the decline in private saving
could reflect a response to other developments in the economy--for
example, a rise in the value of equity holdings and housing wealth, increases
in expected future income, or declines in interest rates--and thus
might not represent a fundamental cause of the U.S. current account deficit.
On the other hand, the decline in saving rates could reflect a structural shift
in household saving and spending behavior. Continued financial liberalization
and innovation have made it easier for Americans to borrow, particularly
against their real estate wealth, and this easing may have led to greater
consumption.</p>

<p>If Americans have
experienced a structural decline in private saving rates, how much of the
widening of the external imbalance could this explain? As shown in <a href="#fig_2" name="fig2">figure 2</a>,
the answer provided by our macroeconomic simulation model is: not much. The
reason is virtually the same as in the case of a rise in fiscal deficits.
According to our simulation, high private consumption boosts GDP growth and--all
else equal--forces up interest rates; although the rise in interest
rates strengthens the dollar, it leads to much lower investment spending.
Accordingly, and as in the case of a fall in public saving, a fall in private
saving appears to crowd out investment more than it crowds out net exports, and
thus leads to little change in the trade balance. I should note, however, that
just as a decline in the budget deficit is desirable even if it would not
substantially reduce the trade deficit, a rise in private saving rates also would
be helpful because it would strengthen private balance sheets and provide
additional resources for investment and growth. </p>

<p><i>3. Productivity growth</i></p>

<p>In both the fiscal
story and the private-saving story, the large U.S. current account deficit
implicitly is the outcome of a rise in consumption relative to income. The
third story I'd like to discuss highlights a more impressive achievement of the
U.S. economy, the surge in labor productivity growth from about 1-1/2 percent
annually in the two decades preceding 1995 to roughly 3 percent in the period
since then. This surge is viewed as having several important consequences.
First, higher productivity growth boosted perceived rates of return on U.S.
investments, thereby generating capital inflows that boosted the dollar.
Second, these higher rates of return also led to a rise in domestic
investment. Finally, expectations of higher returns boosted equity prices,
household wealth, and perceived long-run income, and so consumption rose and
saving rates declined. Under this explanation, all of these factors helped to
widen the current account deficit.</p>

<p>I find this story
compelling. It links two key economic developments of the past decade: the
rise in productivity growth and the widening of the current account deficit.
It also helps to explain several other important developments, including the
fall in U.S. saving rates and the 1990s boom in asset prices. In fact, a
simulation of our macroeconomic model shown in <a href="#fig_3" name="fig3">figure 3</a> suggests that the surge
in productivity growth, while hardly explaining all of the deterioration in the
trade balance since the mid-1990s, accounts for more of that deterioration than
do the public and private saving shocks combined. </p>

<p>Moreover, the
effect of higher productivity growth on the trade balance could have been even
larger than the simulation indicates because it likely worked through several
channels that the model does not incorporate. The simulation does not fully
take into account the rise in stock prices and household wealth--and
hence, consumption--that would have been spurred by expectations of
higher productivity growth. Also, because the simulation does not fully
account for the effect of enhanced perceptions of equity returns on exchange
rates, it does not produce the rise in the dollar that, in all likelihood,
resulted from the productivity surge. </p>

<p><i>4. Slump in foreign domestic demand</i></p>

<p>I would like to
turn now to developments at the global level that may have helped to widen the
U.S. current account deficit. Domestic demand growth has slumped in many
foreign economies because of varying combinations of an increase in saving
rates and a decline in investment. This weakening of foreign spending has
enhanced the supply of capital available to the United States, put downward pressure
on U.S. interest rates, and put upward pressure on the dollar. </p>

<p>As I said before,
I like the U.S. productivity surge story and find it compelling. However, I
also like the foreign demand slump story, and I find it compelling. Some of
the largest industrial economies in the world--Japan and the euro
area--have been running current account surpluses while
experiencing very subdued growth. In the developing world, the East Asian
economies that went through financial crises in the late 1990s have seen a
plunge in their investment rates even as their saving rates have remained
extremely high; the weakness in domestic demand has likely motivated the
authorities in these countries to keep their exchange rates competitive to
promote export-led growth, a strategy that has also contributed to the U.S.
external deficit.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a> More
generally, since 1999, the developing countries as a whole have been running
current account surpluses--with the industrial countries, mainly
the United States, necessarily running current account deficits--for
the first time in many years. </p>

<p>What does our
macroeconomic simulation model say about the likely effect of a slump in
foreign consumption and investment spending? The slump lowers the path of
foreign GDP, which in turn limits U.S. export sales. Additionally, by
depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand
explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in <a href="#fig_4" name="fig4">figure 4</a>. Finally, weaker U.S. net exports reduce overall U.S. activity and depress
interest rates a bit, thus raising domestic consumption and investment
spending. Taken together, these factors contribute importantly to the widening
of the trade deficit since the mid-1990s. </p>

<p><i>5. Improvements in global financial intermediation</i> </p>

<p>Another global factor that has been cited as contributing to the
widening of the U.S. current account deficit has been an increase in global
financial intermediation. Some suggest that home bias--the
disinclination of investors to invest outside their own country--has
been eroding and that this trend has permitted larger current account
imbalances to be financed than would have been possible previously. This
hypothesis is supported by the reduced correlation of national saving and
investment rates in recent years, which implies that savings increasingly are
being used to finance investment in other countries.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a>
Of course, an increased capacity of global financial markets to finance current
account deficits does not, by itself, mean that it is the United States that
would tap this enlarged capacity. However, observers suggest that the United
States' unusually favorable investment climate, protections of investor rights,
and prospects for rates of return made it likely that once international financing
constraints were lifted, the U.S. economy would enjoy larger capital inflows.</p>

<p>So, how much of
the enlargement of the U.S. current account deficit can we attribute to
improved international intermediation? This is difficult to answer because it
is hard enough to measure a concept as amorphous as international financial
intermediation, let alone to gauge its effect on the current account. As a
step in this direction, however, we reasoned that any reduction in home bias by
foreign investors toward the United States would show up as a decline in the
risk premium these investors demand for holding U.S. assets. This decline in
the risk premium, in turn, would lead to a greater demand for U.S. assets and a
rise in the dollar. </p>

<p>Based on an
estimate of the decline in the risk premium that occurred since the mid-1990s,
our macroeconomic model suggests, as shown in <a href="#fig_5" name="fig5">figure 5</a>, that the decline
contributed importantly to the rise in the dollar, and, therefore, to the
widening of the trade deficit. Assuming that the lower risk premium can be
attributed to growing international intermediation, this latter development
apparently exerted an important influence on the U.S. current account. </p>

<p><b>Putting It All Together</b><br>
I would now like
to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of
each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in <a href="#fig_6" name="fig6">figure 6</a>.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a>
To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well
measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I
draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of
the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance. That said, our model
accords the greatest roles to increased productivity growth, which has made the
United States a magnet for foreign saving, and to the slump in foreign domestic
demand, which has led to an excess of saving in those economies. The narrowing
of the risk premium on dollar assets appears to explain a bit less of the
widening of the trade deficit, with the loosening of fiscal policy and
reduction of private saving making still-smaller contributions. Of course,
these results are the product of our model-based analysis, with all of the
strengths and weaknesses that model simulations entail; it would be useful to
complement these findings with more direct historical and empirical analysis of
the U.S. external imbalance.</p>

<p>Attributing the
historically unprecedented widening of the trade deficit, as well as the
similarly unprecedented rise in our international indebtedness, to the
coincidence of many random and unrelated developments would not make for a very
satisfying story. However, my sense is that many of the developments that
contributed to the U.S. trade deficit are not unrelated and may be part of a
broader evolution of the global economy. The same types of liberalization and
innovation that have improved financial intermediation within the United
States, for example, have likely been instrumental in reducing home bias and
increasing intermediation among countries. Improvements in financial markets,
both at home and abroad, may have amplified the effects on the U.S. current
account of other developments I have discussed, including the U.S. productivity
surge and the perceived weakening of foreign investment opportunities. It is
even possible that the expansion of the U.S. budget deficit would have been
smaller had policymakers perceived global financial markets to be less willing
to finance the gap.</p>

<p>The view that the
current account deficit stems from economic developments that are varied and
yet intertwined has important implications for how the deficit will be
corrected. Such a view suggests to me, first, that government policies such as
budget-cutting or encouragement of private saving are unlikely, by themselves,
to correct the current account deficit, much as they might be desirable for
other reasons. Such policies probably do not address all or even most of the
root causes of the current account deficit. </p>

<p>However, the fact
that I have deemphasized government policy as the source of the adjustment
process does not mean that the public sector has no role to play. Reducing our
budget deficit can ease the adjustment process by releasing resources that can
be channeled into higher net exports, so that a reduced trade deficit does not
require a curtailment of investment. The public sector in several nations has
an important role in creating flexible markets for products, labor and
financial assets. Appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies in many
economies can contribute to the private-sector adjustment process by fostering
an environment of innovation, increased productivity and more-rapid growth of
domestic demand. Recognizing the role for public policy, the Group of Seven
industrial nations recently stated that vigorous action is needed to address
global imbalances and foster growth. </p>

<p>The primary impetus
toward adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit, when it occurs, likely
will come from private markets. Here, however, the multiplicity of factors
underlying the large U.S. current account deficit raises questions about how
that adjustment will come about. Some of the developments that may have
supported the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit might reverse
themselves--foreign domestic demand could recover, U.S. private
saving rates could rise. And some of the factors that boosted the U.S. trade
deficit, such as higher productivity growth or financial innovations that
support greater spending, may show up more fully in foreign economies.
Notably, all of these developments would take time to restrain the deficit, and
any one of them, by itself, might have only a small effect. A final
possibility is that, as U.S. deficits widen and foreign claims on the United
States mount, actions by investors to re-balance their accumulation of assets
could lead to changes in exchange rates, interest rates, and other asset prices
that might contribute to a reversal of the deficit.</p>

<p>To the extent that
the adjustment of the U.S. current account is driven by fundamental changes in
the global economy, it is less likely, in my view, to be disruptive or
disorderly. Our own experience with external adjustment in the 1980s was
comparatively orderly, and so was the experience of many other industrial economies
undergoing adjustment in recent decades.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a>
Of course, should adjustment prove disruptive to sustainable growth and stable
prices, the Federal Reserve will certainly be prepared to act. However, my
sense is that the implications of current account adjustment for U.S. economic
growth and inflation will most likely be benign.

developing economies, excluding China, plunged more than 10 percentage points
