 reported on          recent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market          operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period          since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments          in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in          government securities and federal agency obligations during the period          since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified          these transactions.   By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning          in mid-December 2005 the reciprocal currency ("swap") arrangements with          the Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico. The arrangement with the Bank          of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the          Banco de Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Both arrangements          are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American          Framework Agreement of 1994. The vote to renew the System's participation          in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting          because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior          notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  The information received at this meeting suggested that the growth of          economic activity had unexpectedly moderated during the first quarter          from the rapid pace seen during the second half of 2004. Gains in private          payroll employment over the first quarter were similar to the average          for the second half of 2004 but weakened in March, and manufacturing production          rose only a little, on balance, over February and March. Consumers appeared          to have turned somewhat cautious in their spending, likely a reflection          of higher energy prices. Housing starts fell in March after a sustained          stretch of very high readings, but home sales continued at a rapid rate          throughout the quarter. Growth of capital spending, while strong in the          first quarter, was down from the brisk rates of previous quarters. Sharp          increases in energy prices pushed up headline inflation, and core measures          were also somewhat elevated. Labor costs, however, advanced at a moderate          rate. Employment continued to expand in March, although the increase was          less than the strong advance in February. Employment declined in manufacturing,          retail trade, and temporary help services, but most other sectors registered          gains. The average workweek remained at its recent level, and aggregate          hours posted a small gain. The unemployment rate moved down to 5.2 percent          in March. Also suggesting a gradual erosion of slack in labor markets          were surveys indicating that some employers were finding some jobs requiring          special skills harder to fill and that households were experiencing increases          in job availability. Nevertheless, survey measures of expected conditions          in labor markets softened somewhat in the early months of the year, and          the labor market participation rate remained low in March.   Industrial production continued to expand in the first quarter, but          the pace was slower than in the final months of 2004. Gains were restrained          by a decline in manufacturing output, particularly for motor vehicles          and parts, and by a reduction in energy generation at utilities, which          was held down by unseasonably warm weather early in the year. Mining output,          however, accelerated, as did production in the business equipment and          defense and space equipment industries. Capacity utilization in manufacturing          edged up on average in the first quarter, but moved down in March and          remained a bit below its thirty-year average.   Consumer spending advanced solidly in the first quarter despite some          slowing in automobile sales. However, much of that strength was registered          early in the quarter, and spending in March was subdued. Measures of consumer          confidence declined in the early months of the year but remained well          above the lows of two years ago. Other factors underlying consumer spending          also remained favorable: Real wages and salaries continued to rise, and          the ratio of wealth to income remained high, although it was down a bit          because of a decline in equity prices. The personal saving rate stayed          low over the first quarter of the year.  Housing starts slowed in March, after exceptional strength in the prior          two months. However, a substantial increase in the level of permits in          March suggested that starts likely turned back up in April. A similar          pattern was observed in the multifamily sector. The thirty-year mortgage          rate in the first quarter stayed in a range around its average level for          the past two years. Sales of existing homes were rapid throughout the          quarter, and sales of new homes rose to another record level in March.          House prices continued to rise rapidly over the first quarter, although          recent data suggested some slowing.   Growth of business spending on equipment and software moderated substantially          in the first quarter from the very high rates of last year, but appeared          to retain considerable momentum; strong gains occurred in all major categories          except motor vehicles. This performance reflected favorable underlying          fundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained          earnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions          in the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and          loan markets. At the same time, construction of nonresidential structures          remained quite subdued. Over the first quarter, outlays for manufacturing          facilities picked up a bit, but those for office buildings stayed low          despite some declines in the office vacancy rate, and spending on commercial          structures fell.   Nonfarm inventories accumulated in the first two months of the year          at a much faster rate than in the preceding quarter, prompting a small          increase in inventory-sales ratios. Inventory gains were especially strong          early in the quarter and were concentrated in the manufacturing sector.          The U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as exports          held steady. The value of imported oil jumped sharply, and nonoil imports          also rose. Economic indicators for major foreign industrial countries          suggested some slowing of growth late in the quarter after a pickup earlier          in the year. In Japan, industrial production rose briskly in January before          falling back; the euro-area industrial sector evidenced a similar pattern.          By contrast, economic activity in China and other developing countries          showed greater buoyancy. Consumer price inflation abroad remained subdued.          U.S. consumer price inflation firmed in recent months as energy prices          rose sharply. Core consumer prices also rose a bit more rapidly recently,          but the increase over the twelve months ending in March was little different          than over the year-earlier period. According to survey information, expectations          of near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase          in energy prices. As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private          industry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace.          The slowing occurred in both the wages and salaries component and the          benefits component and was fairly widespread across industry groups.   At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase          the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2-3/4          percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception          that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside          risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability          should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that economic output          continued to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices and          that labor market conditions continued to improve gradually. While pressures          on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power was more          evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. In          these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation          could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that          it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill          its obligation to maintain price stability.   The FOMC's decision in March to raise the intended level of the federal          funds rate 25 basis points was fully anticipated by the market, as were          its retention in the accompanying statement of the "measured pace" language          and its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable economic          growth were balanced. Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response          to the statement's references to increased price pressures and to more          evident pricing power as well as to the Committee's conditioning of its          risk assessment on "appropriate monetary policy action." Interest rates          rose further the next day following the release of a larger-than-expected          increase in the CPI for February. Over subsequent weeks, however, these          increases were more than reversed by weaker-than-expected data on consumer          spending, consumer sentiment, and output. Further downward pressure on          interest rates was exerted by the market's response to the release of          the minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference          to Committee members' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening          was not necessary at that time. Despite generally good first-quarter earnings          reports, equity indexes moved down considerably in response to the signs          of weaker economic growth. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose          on balance, apparently due, in part, to disappointing news on employment          and output abroad.  M2 expanded in March and April at about the same sluggish pace as it          did earlier in the year. The growth of M2 continued to be restrained by          increases in its opportunity cost resulting from rising short-term interest          rates. Rates paid on its liquid components particularly lagged increases          in market rates.   Partly in response to the receipt of weaker-than-expected data for spending          and output in the first quarter, the staff marked down somewhat its forecast          of economic growth for 2005 and 2006. Even so, the economy was seen as          retaining considerable momentum, and growth was expected to pick up some          after the first quarter, paced by business spending on equipment and software.          Consumption expenditures were seen as likely to expand at a moderate rate          and residential investment to slow. With exports forecast to expand a          bit more rapidly than imports, the arithmetic net drag on the economy          from trade was expected to lessen. Fiscal policy was expected to provide          a more moderate impetus to growth this year and next, following the substantial          boost estimated for earlier years. Although economic growth was projected          to run a bit above the staff's estimate of the economy's potential, the          unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with          improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into          the labor force. Inflation was projected to edge lower over the rest of          the year and into 2006, reflecting the attenuation of the impact of higher          energy prices and the effects of a slowed rate of growth of import prices          and remaining slack in resource markets.  In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,          meeting participants observed that incoming data over the intermeeting          period hinted at possible upside risks for inflation and downside risks          for economic growth. Earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an          important factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and a slower          pace of economic activity. With energy prices leveling out more recently,          however, and the behavior of compensation suggesting a lack of pressure          in labor markets, underlying inflation appeared to remain contained. The          weakness in spending was widespread and could not be completely dismissed,          but it had appeared only very recently and could be a product of the inherent          noisiness of high-frequency economic data. On balance, economic fundamentals          including low interest rates, robust underlying productivity growth, and          strengthened business balance sheets were expected to support economic          growth at a pace sufficient to gradually eliminate remaining slack in          resource utilization. Although the economic outlook generally seemed favorable,          there was also broad recognition of greater uncertainty attending the          outlook for both inflation and output growth.  Capital expenditures advanced briskly over the first quarter, but at          a pace significantly below that registered over the latter half of last          year. To some extent, businesses probably had pulled capital outlays forward          from this year into 2004 to benefit from the partial-expensing tax provision          that expired at year-end, but the unexpected weakness in capital goods          orders for February and March seemed hard to attribute to this factor          alone. In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices,          the sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist          for some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going          forward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future          and wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or          taking on new workers. A less buoyant and less certain economic outlook          seemed apparent in financial markets as well, where equity prices had          fallen and risk spreads had widened. On balance, though, these financial          developments did not appear to signal the onset of a sharp retrenchment          in investors' willingness to bear risk, and capital expenditures were          seen as likely to remain quite robust, spurred by strong economic fundamentals          that included elevated profits, opportunities to raise efficiency by utilizing          new technologies, a low cost of capital, and strong corporate balance          sheets. Indeed, a substantial weakening in business investment in an environment          with such favorable fundamentals would be at odds with the historical          record.   Incoming data for the household sector were viewed as mixed. Higher          gasoline prices seemed to be sapping consumer confidence and consumer          spending. The pace of consumption growth had fallen off appreciably toward          the end of the first quarter, and some participants worried about the          potential for continued sluggishness in consumer spending if increasingly          cautious households sought to raise their saving rate rapidly. On balance,          though, strong income growth and low interest rates augured well for household          spending. Although housing starts had dropped of late, home sales and          other indicators of activity in the residential real estate market remained          at very high levels. House price appreciation was expected to moderate          over coming quarters, but a number of local real estate markets were still          regarded as "hot," with signs of possible speculative excesses in some          areas.  The deceleration in final sales over the first quarter had been accompanied          by a sizable accumulation of businesses inventories. The available data          suggested that stocks had accumulated in a variety of industries, but          particularly in the motor vehicle sector where the inventory of new autos          had moved appreciably higher. Although difficult to judge, the inventory          buildup was not regarded as likely to have major implications for aggregate          manufacturing beyond some modest production cutbacks in the current quarter.  A relatively high proportion of demand had continued to be met by imports.          Some concern was expressed that incoming data suggested weaker growth          in some of our major trading partners, which posed a downside risk to          forecasts for U.S. exports. Moreover, advances in domestic income were          expected to contribute to brisk growth in imports. Looking ahead, the          U.S. economy was expected to continue to run quite substantial current          account deficits, although the impact of past dollar depreciation should          work to boost exports and slow the rise in imports to some extent.  Recent energy price developments garnered considerable attention. Declines          in energy prices in recent weeks were viewed as welcome, but participants          noted that far-dated futures prices for oil remained quite elevated and          that persistently high energy prices could trigger a range of deleterious          effects on the economy. High energy prices appeared to be taking a toll          on household and business confidence and might be beginning to crimp corporate          profits. In some cases, firms seemed to be more successfully passing on          energy costs to their customers. Indeed, some portion of recent elevated          inflation readings probably represented, at least partly, such pass-through          effects from higher energy costs. However, while pass-through effects          could leave the overall price level higher, their impact on inflation          should fade over time, as long as inflation expectations remain well contained.          Still, considerable uncertainty surrounded the degree of pass-through          from energy prices to core consumer prices, and pass-through effects might          be more pronounced when energy price increases were perceived as more          likely to be permanent. Persistently high energy prices were mentioned          as a factor that could trim the level of potential output to a small degree          over time, possibly contributing to additional upward pressure on consumer          prices at the margin.  Participants voiced concerns about recent price trends; they expected          inflation to remain contained but also perceived that the risks to that          inflation outlook now might be skewed somewhat to the upside. Core measures          of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly          so over the last few months. A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey          measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations          over recent months. Moreover, there were risks that the relative stability          of long-term survey measures of inflation expectations could simply reflect          lags in households' perceptions of changing economic prospects. The success          that some businesses seemed to be encountering in passing through cost          increases raised the possibility that competitive pressures and resource          slack were exerting somewhat less restraint on inflation than had been          anticipated.  However, available indicators of wages and benefits had registered only          modest growth, suggesting to many that some slack in labor markets persisted.          Moreover, market measures of inflation compensation had ebbed in recent          weeks, and survey measures of long-term inflation expectations, albeit          a touch higher of late, remained in the broad range of recent years. Along          with energy prices, import and materials prices apparently had contributed          to the recent uptick in inflation, and pressures on inflation stemming          from these three sources were expected to lessen over coming quarters.          On balance, measures of core inflation were thought likely to remain in          check over the remainder of this year and next.  In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting          period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis          points to 3 percent at this meeting. Although downside risks to sustainable          growth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower          growth of economic activity as likely to be transitory. In this regard,          the ability of the U.S. economy to withstand significant shocks over recent          years buttressed the view that policymakers should not overreact to a          comparatively small number of disappointing indicators, especially when          economic fundamentals appeared to remain quite supportive of continued          solid expansion. To be sure, the Committee had raised its federal funds          rate target appreciably over the past year, and, in the view of a few          members, a larger-than-expected moderation of aggregate demand in response          to this cumulative policy action could not be ruled out. However, all          members regarded the stance of policy as accommodative and judged that          the current level of short-term rates remained too low to be consistent          with sustainable growth and stable prices in the long run. Against the          backdrop of the recent uptick in core inflation and in some measures of          inflation expectations, members agreed that they should continue along          the course of removing policy accommodation at a measured pace conditional          on the outlook for inflation and economic growth.   In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members          agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that rising energy prices          seemed to have spurred an increase in core measures of inflation by dropping          the reference from the March statement indicating that "The rise in energy          prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices."          They likewise all agreed that mention should be made that, on balance,          longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. Regarding          the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted          that the risk assessment conditioned on "appropriate policy" no longer          seemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee's economic          and policy outlook. Although some members noted that a case could be made          that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and          those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most          likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and          the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks          conditional on appropriate policy.   For many, heightened economic uncertainty in the current environment          implied greater uncertainty about the range of possible policy outcomes          and placed a premium on flexibility in setting policy at upcoming meetings.          Some members commented that this greater uncertainty called for eliminating          or paring back forward-looking language from the statement--if not at          this meeting, then fairly soon. In the event, most members viewed the          forward-looking language in the statement--including the characterization          of the stance of policy as accommodative as well as the judgment that          policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is "likely to be          measured"--as a reasonable characterization of the policy stance and its          likely evolution over time. Moreover, a number remarked that the language          in its current form was clearly conditioned on economic developments and          therefore would not stand in the way of either a pause or a step-up in          policy firming depending on events. In the end, all members agreed to          retain the forward-looking language.   At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize          and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed          otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance          with the following domestic policy directive:   "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial            conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable            growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee            in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent            with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent."                  The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the        statement to be released shortly after the meeting:  "The          Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the          upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth          and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation          expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation          can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the          Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill          its obligation to maintain price stability."  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner,          Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Fisher, Gramlich, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Santomero,          and Stern.  Votes against this action: None. Absent and not voting: Mr. Bernanke It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Wednesday-Thursday, June 29-30, 2005.   The meeting
