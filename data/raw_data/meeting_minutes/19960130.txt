 reported on  recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  He indicated that  the swap line drawing by the Bank of Mexico had been repaid in full on  January 29, 1996.  The Committee ratified that transaction by  unanimous vote.  	The Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic  financial markets and on System open market transactions in U.S.  government securities and federal agency obligations during the period  December 19, 1995, through January 30, 1996.  By unanimous vote, the  Committee ratified these transactions.  	The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and  financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in  1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting  period ahead.  A summary of the economic and financial information  available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion  is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was  approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York.  		Only a limited amount of new information was available for  this meeting because of delays in government releases; that which was  available, along with anecdotal commentary, suggested that the economy  had been growing relatively slowly in recent months.  Consumer  spending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business invest-  ment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently,  and housing demand seemed to have leveled out.  Slower growth in final  sales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these  buildups, together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and  severe weather, were having a restraining effect on economic activity.  The demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and  the unemployment rate remained relatively low.  The recent data on  prices and wages had been mixed, but there was no firm evidence of a  change in underlying inflation trends.  	  	Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in  December; the gain was in line with the average monthly increase for  1995.  Employment in manufacturing, boosted by the settlement of a  strike at a major aircraft manufacturer, reversed the declines of  October and November.  Construction payrolls rose further in December,  despite unfavorable weather in some parts of the country.  Job growth  remained solid in much of the services industry, although employment  at personnel supply firms was little changed.  The civilian unemploy-  ment rate remained at 5.6 percent in December.  	  	Industrial production edged up in December and for the fourth  quarter as a whole advanced only slightly; industrial activity  remained sluggish in January according to the limited statistical  information that was available.  In December, manufacturing output  rose a bit in association with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies  and aircraft production.  Elsewhere in manufacturing, the growth of  output of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the  rapid pace of previous months, and the production of defense and space  equipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable  declines.  The output of utilities was boosted somewhat in December by  the effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for  heating services.  Utilization of total industrial capacity fell  slightly but remained at a moderately elevated level.  	  	Retail sales continued to grow at a relatively modest rate in  December, and the fourth-quarter increase was considerably smaller  than those of the previous two quarters.  In the fourth quarter, lower  spending at general merchandisers offset much of the sales gains  registered at automotive dealerships, furniture and appliance stores,  and building and supply outlets.  Consumer surveys indicated some  deterioration in consumer confidence in January.  Recent indicators  of housing demand and activity were mixed.  Sales of new homes edged  still lower in November (latest data available), and sales of existing  homes declined by a larger amount in December than in November.  However, housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October  decline, and conditions in mortgage markets remained quite favorable,  led by a further decline in rates.  	  	The sparse statistical data available on business fixed  investment, along with anecdotal information, suggested a moderation  recently in the expansion of business spending on capital goods,  including some slowing of investment in computers.  Investment in  transportation equipment, however, apparently had held up well in the  fourth quarter.  Incoming data on construction contracts pointed to  some slowing in the growth of nonresidential building activity from a  relatively brisk pace during most of 1995.  	  	The information available on business inventories suggested  that inventory imbalances might have emerged in a few sectors in  association with weaker-than-expected sales.  Motor vehicle  inventories were at elevated levels compared with sales in late 1995,  and manufacturers responded by offering incentive packages on new cars  and trucks and by adjusting downward their January production  schedules.  Data on manufacturing and retail trade inventories for  November had been delayed, but published information on inventories  held by wholesale distributors indicated a decline in that month,  reversing part of October's sizable run-up.  Much of the decline  occurred in nondurable goods, although machinery distributors also  reported a sizable liquidation.  The inventory-sales ratio for the  wholesale trade sector edged down in November but remained near the  high end of its range in recent years.  	  	The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services  narrowed in October from its average rate in the third quarter.  The  value of imports declined by more than the value of exports.  Much of  the contraction in imports reflected reductions in oil and automotive  products that more than offset another strong rise in computer goods.  For exports, an advance in machinery exports to record levels was  outweighed by a reduction in shipments of agricultural and automotive  products.  Available data on economic activity in the major foreign  industrial countries suggested that the pace of expansion in Europe  had slowed further on average while growth in Japan had picked up a  little.  	  	Recent data suggested little change in underlying inflation  trends.  Consumer prices increased slightly in December after being  unchanged in November; food prices were quiescent over the two-month  period while energy prices rose on balance, with a December rebound  more than offsetting a sizable November drop.  Excluding food and  energy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the November-  December period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in  1994.  Producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in  November and December after having risen slowly in earlier months; in  large part, the price increases late in the year reflected sharp  upward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices.  For 1995, producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy  rose at a subdued pace, though somewhat more than in 1994.  Commodity  prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier.  Average  hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased  somewhat in December after having been unchanged in November.  Increases in average hourly earnings had been trending up over the  past several years.  	  	At its meeting on December 19, 1995, the Committee adopted a  directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure  on reserve positions, which was expected to result in a decline in the  federal funds rate from around 5-3/4 percent to around 5-1/2 percent.  The directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction  of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.  Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the  Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable  economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,  financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve  restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable  during the intermeeting period.  The reserve conditions associated  with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate  growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.  	   	After the meeting, open market operations were directed  initially toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of  reserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee and thereafter  toward maintaining this new reserve posture.  Operations were  complicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with year-  end pressures and the adverse effects of unusually severe winter  weather on check clearings.  Although the federal funds rate exhibited  somewhat greater volatility than normal over the period, it  nonetheless averaged close to the expected level of 5-1/2 percent.  The occasional periods of firmness in reserve market conditions  contributed to higher adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, on average,  over the period.  	   	Most market interest rates had declined somewhat further over  the period after the December 19 meeting.  Rates moved lower  immediately after the policy easing action, and most fell still more  on balance over the remainder of the intermeeting interval in response  to incoming information about the economy and the prospects for fiscal  policy, at least in the near term.  Both were seen as suggesting  slower economic expansion for a time and an increased likelihood of  additional easing of monetary policy in coming months.  With bond  yields down on balance, and occasionally approaching two-year lows,  major indexes of equity prices advanced sharply further.  	   	The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other  G-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite  the decline in U.S. interest rates.  The dollar's upward movement  against the German mark and other European currencies was associated  with increasing indications of further weakening of economic expansion  in key European countries and greater declines in interest rates in  those countries than in the United States.  The dollar's appreciation  relative to the Japanese yen appeared to be related in part to a  narrowing of Japan's trade and current account surpluses.  The dollar  was unchanged on balance against the Canadian dollar, while the  Mexican peso rose considerably in relation to the dollar.  	   	Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January.  The pickup in M2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines  in short-term interest rates; those declines had made money market  instruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in  M2, whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a  considerable lag.  In addition, the flattening of the term structure  of interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond  mutual funds, which had continued to experience only light inflows.  Faster growth of M3 in December and January was associated with both  the pickup in M2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time  deposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in  January.  The expansion of M2 from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the  fourth quarter of 1995 was in the upper half of the Committee's annual  range, and M3 grew at the upper end of its range.  Growth of total  domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months, and for  the year was near the midpoint of this aggregate's monitoring range.  	   	The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that  economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near  term.  This forecast was not materially different from that prepared  for the December meeting, except for a slightly weaker outlook for the  current quarter that was related in part to an inventory correction  and the effects of unusually severe winter weather on spending and  output.  Over the remainder of the two-year forecast horizon, the  economy was expected to grow generally along its estimated potential.  Consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of  disposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer  debt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of  credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity  holdings would support further increases in consumption.  The further  decline in mortgage rates recently from already-favorable levels would  help to sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level.  With sales and profits projected to grow more slowly, and with  utilization of existing capacity having eased considerably, business  investment in new equipment and structures was expected to expand at a  more moderate rate.  In light of the recent strengthening of the  dollar, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining  influence on real activity over the projection period as a whole.  Much uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the recent  impasse in the budget negotiations between the Administration and the  Congress suggested a lower degree of fiscal restraint over coming  years than had been assumed in the previous forecast.  Given the  projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources  and of inflation were not expected to change materially.  	   	In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective  economic activity, members noted a number of temporary factors that  were retarding the expansion.  The weakness in business activity this  winter was to some extent the result of the partial shutdown of the  federal government and the severe storms in a number of regions; both  clearly were transitory influences on the economy.  Growth of economic  activity also was being constrained by production cutbacks stemming  from efforts to bring stocks into better alignment with disappointing  sales in a number of industries.  Even so, in the absence of major  overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables,  and given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed  that a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively  brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy.  At the same time, many observed that the risks to such an outcome did  not seem balanced.  A number of concerns, including the extent of the  damping effects of high debt loads and employment uncertainty on  consumption and questions about the sources of further export growth,  suggested the possibility of sluggish expansion, while possible  developments on the upside were more difficult to identify.  With  resource use unlikely to vary appreciably, the members generally  expected no significant change in the underlying inflation picture  over the year ahead.  The recent performance of inflation had some  encouraging aspects, and the odds on greater price pressures seemed  relatively small at this time.  	   	In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee  establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt  aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank  presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual  projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and  inflation for the year 1996.  Measured on the basis of chain-weighted  indexes, the forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central  tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2  percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth  quarter of 1996.  The members and nonmember presidents generally  anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would  be associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force.  Accordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in  the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central  tendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6  percent.  Projections of the rate of inflation, as reflected in the  consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent;  that central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995--  when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food  prices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts  anticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation.  	   	In their review of developments across the nation, the  Federal Reserve Bank presidents reported modest growth in most major  areas of the country.  Many referred, however, to an admixture of  strengths and weaknesses in their local economies, and a majority  observed that on balance growth in regional business activity appeared  to have slowed in the last few months.  In keeping with the data  available for the nation as a whole, the slowing seemed to be  concentrated in manufacturing and especially at firms producing motor  vehicles and parts.  Some presidents referred to relatively negative,  or at least cautious, sentiment among many of their business contacts.  	   	Much of the recent softening in economic activity appeared to  arise from production cutbacks in various sectors of the economy where  involuntary accumulation of inventories seemed to have occurred as a  result of weaker sales trends in the past few months.  The members  expected this inventory adjustment process to have a relatively  pronounced effect on production and overall business activity in the  current quarter and perhaps to some extent in the second.  While a  greater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects  through the economy could not be ruled out, the underlying strength of  demand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate  growth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and  production adjustments subsided.  	   	With regard to consumer spending, members referred to overall  indications of lackluster retail sales during the holiday season and  into January.  The anecdotal commentary on retail sales attributed  some of the recent weakness in a number of areas to the clearly  temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather and the partial  shutdown of the federal government.  The members anticipated that  moderate growth in retail sales would resume, though some felt that  the consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside.  The  consumer spending outlook was complicated by a number of  crosscurrents.  Negative factors cited by the members included ongoing  concerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing  stream of workforce reduction announcements by major business  concerns, increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in  rising delinquency rates on some types of loans, and the apparent  satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer  durables.  On the positive side, reduced interest rates, still readily  available credit, and the accumulation of financial wealth from the  sharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support  continuing gains in consumer spending.  	   	Further increases in business fixed investment were viewed as  a likely prospect for the year ahead, though the growth of such  investment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced  earlier in the current cyclical expansion.  Anecdotal reports  indicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some  parts of the country, but declining rates of capacity utilization  augured reduced growth going forward.  The expansion of investment in  producers' durable equipment also was expected to slow, but from a  pace that had seemed unsustainable.  While appreciable further growth  could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business  firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their  operations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other  types of equipment was likely to be sluggish.  Members noted in  particular the prospects for weaker business spending for motor  vehicles, especially for heavy trucks.  However, the fundamental  determinants of investment in business equipment, including the  reduced cost of financing such investment, remained positive and this  sector of the economy should continue to provide considerable impetus  to the expansion.  	   	The members also viewed the considerable decline that had  occurred in mortgage interest rates and the ample availability of  housing finance as key factors in their forecasts of sustained  residential construction at relatively high levels.  Adverse weather  conditions appeared to have retarded home building activity in a  number of areas in recent weeks, but several members commented that  underlying trends in housing demand were favorable and that  residential construction had remained relatively strong in several  parts of the country.  	   	The outlook for fiscal policy was uncertain, especially with  regard to whether longer-term spending and taxation measures would be  enacted to implement the goal of a balanced federal budget by the year  2002.  For the year immediately ahead, however, the members continued  to anticipate considerable restraint in federal spending, partly as a  byproduct of the current budget debate between the Congress and the  Administration.  With regard to the external sector of the economy,  prospects for economic growth in major trading partners--led by  developments in Europe--appeared to have weakened, and the recent  appreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets also might  tend to damp net exports.  Consequently, several members saw downside  risks in the foreign trade sector over the year ahead.  	   	The members anticipated that inflation would remain contained  in 1996, but they did not expect significant progress toward more  stable prices.  They referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook  for wages and prices in the year ahead.  Factors pointing to  potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food  prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and  relatively low grain supplies.  More generally, resource utilization  was expected to remain high and greater pressures could emerge in  labor and product markets.  Members noted that one broad measure of  wages had picked up and that there was a small rise in the number of  anecdotal reports indicating that labor shortages were contributing to  higher wages in some parts of the country.  In addition, unusually  muted increases in the costs of worker benefits had been holding down  overall compensation costs, and this pattern might not persist.  On  the other hand, high levels of resource utilization had been  associated for some time with lower rates of growth in costs than  would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience.  In  particular, a general sense of job insecurity in a period of major  business restructurings was holding down increases in labor  compensation.  In an environment of strong competition, which was  preventing many businesses from passing on rising costs through higher  prices, firms continued to focus on efforts to control costs by  improving the efficiency of their operations, and this was helping to  hold down inflation.  An apparent decline in inflationary expectations  also would provide a moderating influence on inflation trends in the  period ahead.  While most of the members saw little reason to  anticipate appreciably lower inflation over the year ahead, they also  viewed the odds on a pickup in inflation as fairly low; they could see  possible reasons for optimism on the long-run trend in inflation; and  they generally remained confident that further progress toward price  stability would be made over the longer term.  	    	In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and  Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee  reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in  1996 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in  July 1995.  The tentative ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent  for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of  1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for growth  of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7  percent for 1996.  The tentative ranges for 1996 were unchanged from  the actual ranges for 1995.  In July, the range for M3 had been raised  by two percentage points to reflect developments that seemed to be  fostering a return to the historical pattern of somewhat faster growth  in M3 than in M2.  	   	In their discussion, the members took note of a staff  analysis which indicated that monetary expansion consistent with the  moderate growth of nominal GDP that the members were projecting for  1996 most likely would be around the upper ends of the tentative  ranges adopted last July.  M2 and M3 velocity over the past couple of  years had conformed more closely on balance with historical patterns,  and the projections assumed that this behavior would continue in  1996.  In light of the experience of earlier years, however, when the  velocities of these aggregates had exhibited pronounced atypical  behavior, substantial uncertainty still surrounded any projections of  monetary expansion and the linkage between particular rates of money  growth and the basic objectives of monetary policy.  	    	Most members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low  ranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1996 that the Committee had set on a  tentative basis in July 1995.  These members favored retention of the  tentative ranges because they could be viewed as benchmarks for money  growth that would be associated with price stability, assuming  behavior of velocity in line with historical experience, and a  reaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the Committee's  commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over the longer  term.  Some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to  align them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with  the Committee's expectations for expansion of the economy and prices  in 1996 could be misinterpreted.  Such an action might be seen as  suggesting that the Committee had a greater degree of confidence in  the relationship between money growth and broad measures of economic  performance than was warranted by its current understanding of that  relationship or that the Committee was now placing greater emphasis on  the broad monetary aggregates as a gauge of the thrust of monetary  policy.  	   	Two members favored somewhat higher growth ranges for M2 and  M3 in 1996.  They noted that the expansion of these broad aggregates  was anticipated to be around the upper ends of their tentative ranges,  and perhaps even higher, given the Committee's expectations for the  performance of the economy and prices.  In their view, the higher  ranges would be more consistent with what they saw as the Committee's  obligations under the Federal Reserve Act to set ranges consistent  with expected or desired economic outcomes for the year, and the  reasons for establishing those ranges could easily be set forth and  understood as an appropriate technical adjustment that would not imply  any lessened commitment to the Committee's price stability goal.  	   	The Committee unanimously preferred to retain the 3 to 7  percent range for total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1996.  This  position took account of a staff projection indicating that the debt  aggregate was likely to continue to grow at a rate generally in line  with the expansion of nominal GDP, although some moderation in private  credit demands was anticipated and there were indications that lenders  were no longer easing their terms and conditions for granting credit  to consumers and businesses.       	At the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee voted to  approve without change the tentative ranges for 1996 that it had  established in July of last year.  In keeping with its usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its  ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light  of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing  economic and financial developments.  Accordingly, the following  longer-run policy statement for 1995 was approved for inclusion in  the domestic policy directive:          	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price       stability and promote sustainable growth in output.       In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at       this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and       M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively,       measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth       quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for growth of       total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7       percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary       aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light       of progress toward price level stability, movements in       their velocities, and developments in the economy and       financial markets.   Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan,            McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley, McTeer, Ms.            Phillips, and Mr. Stern.   Votes against this action:  Mr. Lindsey and            Ms. Yellen.   	   	Mr. Lindsey and Ms. Yellen dissented because they preferred  somewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3.  They recognized that the  relationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad  measures of economic performance were subject to substantial  uncertainty, but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis  in July 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion  consistent with the central tendency of members' current forecasts of  nominal GDP growth for 1996.  Raising the ranges for M2 and M3 would  in their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in  the Federal Reserve Act that require the System to communicate to the  Congress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for  the calendar year.  They believed the Committee could readily explain  that such an adjustment to the ranges did not represent a lessened  commitment to its price stability goal or an increased emphasis on the  monetary aggregates in policy formulation.  	   	The Committee also discussed alternatives to the monetary  aggregates for communicating its intentions with regard to the course  of inflation over the longer run.  Some members thought that explicit  numerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years  would have several important benefits, including enhanced credibility  that could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater  flexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing  policy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation  concerns.  Other members, while endorsing fully the long-term goal of  price stability, had a number of reservations about implementing such  proposals, especially at this time.  Based on experience in the United  States and elsewhere, many were skeptical about the payoff in terms of  greater credibility or flexibility in policy implementation.  Moreover, they believed that substantially more study and deliberation  were required to explore fully the alternatives and the consequences  of changes in the way the Committee formulated and communicated its  objectives.  They also thought that any such assessment would need to  take account of the prospects for, or disposition of, closely related  legislation that was now being considered in the Congress.  The  Committee did not take any action on this issue at this meeting, but  it recognized that the matter would need to be revisited from time to  time.  	   	In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting  period ahead, the members supported a proposal calling for some slight  easing in reserve conditions.  Although a pickup to an acceptable rate  of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in  coming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to  be significant.  At the same time, while most members were forecasting  high levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation  this year, they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move  might foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances, and some  felt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved  inflation performance.  Under the circumstances, a slight decrease was  warranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of  members considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed  less appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of  a pickup in inflation.  One member pointed out that such a decrease  would tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent  rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which might continue  to move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were  not forthcoming.  It was noted that postponing a decision in this  uncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more  evidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy  was quite temporary or more lasting; if it was the former,  inflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates.  On  the other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish  performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more  pronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to  policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that  surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy.  	   	The Chairman informed the Committee that he had asked the  members of the Board of Governors to convene immediately after this  meeting to consider a reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the  discount rate.  Such a reduction had been proposed by a total of six  Federal Reserve Banks at this point.  Given the easing in reserve  markets favored by the Committee and the possibility of a lower  discount rate, the members did not believe that a further policy move  was likely to be needed during the intermeeting period.  Accordingly,  they favored an unbiased directive that did not incorporate a  presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy  during the next several weeks.  In keeping with its usual practice,  the Committee did not rule out the possibility of an intermeeting  policy change on the basis of unanticipated economic or financial  developments.  	   	At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the  members supported a directive that called for a slight reduction in  the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a  bias about the likely direction of an adjustment to policy during the  intermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a  change in policy.  Accordingly, the Committee decided that in the  context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable  economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,  financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly  lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting  period.  The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were  expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over  coming months.   	   	At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:         	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests      that the economy has been growing rather slowly in      recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to      expand moderately in December, and the civilian      unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent.  Industrial      production increased only slightly further in the      fourth quarter.  Growth of consumer spending was      modest, on balance, over the past several months.      Housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable      October decline.  Orders for nondefense capital goods      point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on      business equipment, and nonresidential construction has      risen appreciably further.  The nominal deficit on U.S.      trade in goods and services narrowed in October from      its average rate in the third quarter.  There has been      no clear change in underlying inflation trends.        	Most market interest rates have declined somewhat      since the Committee meeting on December 19.  In foreign      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen      further over the intermeeting period.        	Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and      January.  From the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth      quarter of 1995, M2 expanded in the upper half of its      range and M3 grew at the upper end of its range.      Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been      moderate in recent months, placing this aggregate near      the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.        	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary      and financial conditions that will foster price stabil-      ity and promote sustainable growth in output.  In      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of      1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively,      measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth      quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for growth of      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7      percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light      of progress toward price level stability, movements in      their velocities, and developments in the economy and      financial markets.        	In the implementation of policy for the immediate      future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,      taking account of a possible reduction in the discount      rate.  In the context of the Committee's long-run      objectives for price stability and sustainable economic      growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,      financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater      reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint      would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.  The      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over      coming months.   Votes for short-run policy:  Messrs.      	Greenspan, McDonough, Boehne, Jordan, Kelley,      	Lindsey, McTeer, Ms. Phillips, Mr. Stern and Ms.      	Yellen.   Votes against this action:  None.     	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on  	Tuesday, March 26, 1996.  	The meeting
