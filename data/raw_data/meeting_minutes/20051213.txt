 reported          on recent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open          market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the          period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments          in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in          government securities and federal agency obligations during the period          since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified          these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy          continued to expand at a solid rate in the fourth quarter. Industrial          production rebounded, and employment growth appeared to have recovered          smartly from the depressing effects of recent hurricanes. Although some          scattered signs of cooling of the housing sector had emerged, the pace          of construction activity and sales remained brisk. More broadly, spending          by consumers and businesses was well maintained. Core consumer price inflation          remained subdued, even though some of the increase in energy costs had          apparently passed through to prices of final goods and services.   Private nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in November after a small gain          in October. Construction employment posted another large increase, probably          owing in part to hurricane-related activity. Broad-based gains in durable          goods industries augmented manufacturing employment, and employment in          the related industries of temporary help services and wholesale trade          increased as well. With employment rising but the average workweek of          production or nonsupervisory workers falling slightly, aggregate hours          slipped in November--albeit to a level above that of their third-quarter          average. The unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent, and the labor          force participation rate was also unchanged. Survey measures of individuals'          expectations of future labor market conditions improved in November, largely          reversing post-Katrina declines.   Industrial production rebounded in October after having been held down          in September by hurricanes and by a strike at Boeing. The resumption of          commercial aircraft production boosted manufacturing output and more than          offset a fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Large output          gains in hurricane-affected industries--such as segments of the food,          rubber and plastics, and paper industries--also contributed to the          increase in manufacturing output. The growth of high-tech output slowed          slightly in October, mainly as a result of smaller increases in the production          of semiconductors. In contrast, production of communication equipment--particularly          data networking equipment--accelerated. With many energy facilities          in the Gulf region still closed, output at mines, which is defined to          include oil and gas extraction, slipped further in October. Manufacturing          capacity utilization moved up again in October and was only a touch below          its long-run average.   Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing solidly          over the course of the fourth quarter, led by improvements in the fundamental          determinants of consumer spending. Real disposable personal income was          bolstered by gains in employment and falling retail energy prices, while          continued brisk advances in house prices and the recent strengthening          of equity prices contributed importantly to increases in household wealth.          Consumer sentiment picked up in November and early December; some survey          measures of confidence returned to the range seen during the first half          of the year. The personal saving rate--while still slightly negative--moved          up in October.  Activity in the housing market remained brisk despite a rise in mortgage          interest rates. Starts of new single-family homes dropped back somewhat          in October from September's very strong pace, but permit issuance          remained elevated. New home sales reached a new high in October, and existing          home sales eased off only a little from the high levels recorded during          the summer. Other available indicators of housing activity were on the          soft side: An index of mortgage applications for purchases of homes declined          in November, and builders' ratings of new home sales had fallen          off in recent months. In addition, survey measures of homebuying attitudes          had declined to levels last observed in the early 1990s.   Real outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the third          quarter. Although business purchases of motor vehicles declined in October          and November, growth in investment in nontransportation equipment appeared          to have been well maintained in the fourth quarter. Rising business sales,          a declining cost of capital, and ample financial resources in the corporate          sector continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending,          a sentiment echoed in executive surveys, which generally pointed to widespread          increases in planned capital outlays. Real spending on nonresidential          construction improved materially in the third quarter, boosted by substantial          gains in drilling and mining expenditures.  Real nonfarm inventories ran off in the third quarter as automakers          pared their motor vehicle stocks. But even outside the motor vehicle sector,          inventory investment was relatively restrained, and partial data for October          suggested that real stockbuilding continued to be subdued. The level of          stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with sales.  The U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in September.          A surge in imports was accompanied by a fairly sizable drop in exports,          part of which was due to a steep falloff in aircraft exports as a result          of the strike at Boeing. The jump in the value of imports was driven by          strong growth in most categories of goods and, to a lesser extent, growth          in services; increases in the dollar value of imports of oil and of industrial          supplies--especially natural gas--were particularly strong,          a reflection of higher prices. Foreign industrialized economies expanded          robustly in the third quarter, and available indicators for the fourth          quarter appeared promising, on balance.   Core consumer price inflation was moderate in recent months, although          some signs of pass-through of higher energy costs were evident, especially          in transportation services. Consumer energy prices had retreated notably          from their elevated post-hurricane levels. Wholesale and retail gasoline          prices dropped as gasoline inventories rebounded. And spot prices for          natural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate          weather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels;          unusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices          to move back up to their October levels. Presumably in response to falling          retail energy prices, one survey of households in November and early December          showed a marked retreat in expectations for inflation over the coming          year. Longer-term inflation expectations also edged down, but stayed a          touch above the narrow range observed in recent years. Although recent          increases in energy costs had pushed up producer prices in some sectors,          overall producer price inflation remained subdued. With regard to labor          costs, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private          industry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase. Hourly          compensation in the nonfarm business sector also appeared to have slowed          a bit recently.  At its November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to          increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to          4 percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that,          with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks          to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be          kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that elevated energy prices          and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity had temporarily          depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation,          coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing          support to economic activity. And although the cumulative rise in energy          and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressures, core          inflation had been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation          expectations remained contained. In these circumstances, the Committee          believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was          likely to be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic          prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.  Market participants widely anticipated the Committee's decision          at its November meeting, and the policy announcement evoked little reaction          in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked up          slightly their expectations for the path of monetary policy in light of          stronger-than-expected data on spending and production. Nominal Treasury          yields changed little, on net, but measures of inflation compensation          at longer horizons--which are calculated using yields on nominal          and inflation-protected securities--declined somewhat. Credit spreads          on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged          over the intermeeting period. Major equity price indexes posted substantial          gains, spurred by the perception that the economy had retained considerable          momentum with limited inflation pressures. In foreign exchange markets,          the trade-weighted value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting          period.  The expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated          a little from its brisk third-quarter pace. Consumer credit dipped in          October, and nonfinancial firms' net borrowing in the form of bank          loans, commercial paper, and bonds was a bit below the third-quarter pace.          Household bankruptcies hovered at very low levels in recent weeks after          soaring to unprecedented heights just before the implementation of more-stringent          bankruptcy rules in mid-October. Hurricane relief payments apparently          boosted M2 in October, but that aggregate decelerated in November, partly          reflecting the continued rise in the opportunity cost of holding liquid          deposits.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of          economic activity would slow from this year's pace, but remain solid,          with output staying near the economy's potential over the next two          years. Although hurricane-related rebuilding would boost activity, especially          in the near term, this stimulus increasingly would be countered by higher          interest rates, the anticipated waning of the positive wealth effect associated          with large earlier gains in equity and house prices, and reduced impetus          from fiscal policy. Both overall and core consumer price inflation were          projected to move higher in the first half of next year, reflecting the          effects of higher energy prices, but then to trend lower as those effects          ebb.   In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants          noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been encouraging          with regard to both economic growth and inflation. The economic expansion          had shown considerable resilience in the face of higher energy prices          and hurricane-related disruptions, suggesting greater underlying strength          than had been apparent at the time of the November meeting. At the same          time, incoming inflation data had been benign, indicating relatively modest          pass-through of higher energy prices to core inflation to date; subdued          gains in compensation and strong growth in productivity were holding down          business costs; and inflation expectations, which had jumped after the          hurricanes, had fallen back. Nonetheless, with growth solid and prices          of energy products still well above levels earlier in the year, possible          increases in resource utilization had the potential to add to pressures          on prices, especially in the absence of some further firming of policy.  In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants          noted that, while light vehicle sales had slowed in the fall, consumer          spending outside the auto sector appeared to have remained vigorous. Holiday          sales were said to be off to a good start in many parts of the country.          The substantial recovery in measures of consumer confidence after their          sharp declines in the aftermath of the hurricanes had reduced meeting          participants' concerns about a significant pull-back in spending.          Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further          advances in employment and income.  Meeting participants discussed tentative signs that activity was beginning          to slow in the housing sector. Reports from contacts in many parts of          the country suggested somewhat less ebullient market conditions, and measures          of confidence of homebuyers and builders had fallen back noticeably. A          downshift in attitudes regarding the outlook for the housing sector could          have significant market effects, in part by damping the demand for houses          by investors and speculators. A slowing of house price increases, by restraining          the expansion of consumption, and a moderation in the pace of new building          were expected to reduce the growth of aggregate demand somewhat in coming          quarters. To date, however, the national data on home prices, sales, and          construction activity did not suggest a significant weakening in the sector.          Business investment spending had accelerated some since midyear. In          part, the pickup may have reflected an increase in business confidence          as the economy proved resilient in the face of this year's substantial          adverse shocks. Participants noted that the improved performance of investment          suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening          business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth          of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.   Economic activity also could be buoyed by developments in other sectors          of the economy. Increased federal government outlays were expected to          boost output a little next year. Supportive financial conditions and an          apparent increase in confidence had contributed to a pickup in growth          abroad. Despite possible firming of monetary policy by some foreign central          banks and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar owing to          global demands for dollar assets, a good portion of the recent strength          in foreign economic growth was expected to persist and provide support          for U.S. exports.   In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that their concerns          about near-term inflation pressures had eased somewhat over the intermeeting          period. Recent data suggested that, thus far, indirect effects of elevated          energy prices on core inflation had been muted. Moreover, energy prices          generally had fallen back on balance since earlier in the fall, and much          of the increases in inflation expectations posted in the aftermath of          the hurricanes had reversed. Participants noted that robust competition--including          that from foreign producers--and further substantial gains in productivity          were helping to contain cost and price pressures. Moreover, measures of          labor compensation showed only moderate gains while relatively wide profit          margins could allow firms to absorb somewhat larger increases in labor          and other costs without boosting prices. Nonetheless, surveys and anecdotal          reports suggested that some firms were successfully passing at least a          portion of their increased costs on to customers, and many participants          remained concerned that elevated energy prices could put pressure on core          inflation. Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy          was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent          strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten          further and inflation pressures build. Under these circumstances, and          with policy having been accommodative for some time, inflation expectations          could rise if monetary policy were not seen as responding to contain such          risks.   In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting          period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis          points to 4-1/4 percent. With spending apparently retaining considerable          momentum, and with the indirect effects of increased energy prices still          threatening to raise core inflation at least for a time, the Committee          thought that additional policy firming at this meeting was appropriate          to keep inflation and inflation expectations in check. Committee members          generally anticipated that policy would likely need to be firmed further          going forward. In that process, the Committee would need to be mindful          of the lags in the effect of policy firming on the economy. However, it          would also have to take account of the effects of the sustained period          of favorable financial conditions on asset prices and aggregate demand          as well as the resulting possibility of further increases in resource          utilization and pressures on prices. Views differed on how much further          tightening might be required. Because the Committee's actions over          the past eighteen months had significantly reduced the degree of monetary          policy accommodation, members thought that the policy outlook was becoming          considerably less certain and that policy decisions going forward would          depend to an increased extent on the implications of incoming economic          data for future growth and inflation.   The Committee agreed that several changes in the wording of the announcement          to be released after today's meeting would be appropriate. The federal          funds rate had been boosted substantially, and, in the view of some members,          it was now likely within a broad range of values that might turn out to          be consistent with output remaining close to potential. In these circumstances,          the Committee thought that policy should no longer be characterized as          accommodative. Members concurred that the statement should note that the          expansion remained solid despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related          disruptions. While inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained          contained, the Committee agreed that the announcement should indicate          that possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy          prices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures and that "some          further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks          to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability          roughly in balance." Although future action would depend on the          incoming data, this characterization of the outlook for policy was seen          by most members as indicating that, given the information now in hand,          the number of additional firming steps required probably would not be          large. Some members thought that the word "measured" was no          longer necessary, but its retention for this meeting was seen as potentially          useful to preclude a possible misinterpretation that the Committee now          saw a significant possibility of adjusting policy in larger increments          in the near future. Wording of the announcement along these lines was          not expected to have a substantial effect on market expectations for policy,          though such effects were especially difficult to judge given the extensive          changes being made to the statement. The members agreed that the announcement          should end by noting that policy will respond to changes in economic prospects          as needed to foster the Committee's objectives.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct          the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,          to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following          domestic policy directive: "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial          conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth          in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate          future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing          the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-1/4 percent." The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in          the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: "The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming          is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable          economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event,          the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed          to foster these objectives." Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs.          Ferguson, Fisher, Kohn, Olson, Moskow, Santomero, and Stern.  Votes against this action: None It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Tuesday, January 31, 2006.       The meeting
