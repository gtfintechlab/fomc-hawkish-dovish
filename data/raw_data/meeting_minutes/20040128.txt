 reported on recent developments          in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign          currencies for the         System's Account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets          and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal          agency obligations during the period December 9, 2003 to January 27, 2004.          By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  At this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion          of its communication practices.   A portion of this discussion focused on the report of a working group          that had been directed to study how the Committee’s announcements          might be improved. In the course of the discussion, members stressed the          importance that they attached to conveying clearly to the public information          regarding the reasons for policy decisions and how those decisions related          to the Committee’s longer-term objectives. However, only limited          support emerged for the use of particular standard wording to express          the Committee’s appraisals of the economic outlook and views about          the balance of risks. Indeed, several members were in favor of discontinuing          the use of statements regarding the balance of risks to the outlook and          instead focusing mostly on the reasons for their policy decisions in the          announcement. At the same time, all the members indicated that they could          support a flexible approach in which the wording of the Committee’s          announcements, including the assessment of the balance of risks going          forward, would be adjusted gradually over time in keeping with evolving          economic conditions.  In further discussion the members reviewed the potential value and drawbacks          of accelerating the publication of Committee minutes. Possible benefits          would include the provision of more complete information sooner after          meetings on the considerations that led the Committee to adopt the current          stance of policy. Some members expressed concern, however, that accelerated          release of the minutes might have the potential to feed back adversely          on the deliberations of the Committee and on the minutes themselves. The          members also emphasized the importance of allowing sufficient time for          them to review and comment on the minutes and for reconciling differences          of opinion among the members of a large and geographically dispersed committee.          At the conclusion of this discussion, staff was asked to study the issue          further.  The members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes          in the content, time horizon, and frequency of the individual forecasts          that are summarized in the semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports to the          Congress. In general, the members saw little to be gained by altering          the Committee’s current practices in any significant way, although          some proposed relatively minor changes. It was agreed that there was no          need to reach a decision on such changes at this time, but staff was instructed          to ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making          possible minor adjustments to current procedures.   The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and          the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.  The economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth          quarter, though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third          quarter. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over          the final three months of the year, and activity in the residential sector          remained at a very high level. On the business side, outlays for equipment          and software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter, and firms          apparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters.          Despite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving          only slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the          fourth quarter. Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation          expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003.   The December employment report suggested that the labor market had not          gained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way. Private          nonfarm payrolls increased only slightly in that month, and their level          in November was revised down appreciably. The average monthly increase          in employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery          in the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average          monthly loss during the first half of the year. Manufacturing payrolls          continued to shrink in December at about the same pace as in the previous          few months, and holiday-related hiring in retail trade was below average.          In other sectors, job gains were recorded in construction, education and          health services, and professional and business services. Average weekly          hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined somewhat in December,          reversing the gains of the previous two months. Aggregate hours worked          by nonfarm employees fell in December but in the fourth quarter as a whole          posted their first quarterly increase since 2000. Despite the weak payroll          data, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey,          fell to 5.7 percent in December, in part because of a further decline          in the labor force participation rate. Initial claims for unemployment          insurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference          week for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth          in January.  The pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth          quarter. Total industrial production rose at the fastest rate since the          second quarter of 2002, and manufacturing production posted solid and          widespread gains. High-tech industries, including those producing semiconductors,          computers, and communications equipment, accounted for nearly one-third          of the increase in total industrial production in the fourth quarter.          After having surged in the third quarter, the production of motor vehicles          and parts moved up in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as overall          manufacturing. Outside the manufacturing sector, output at mines increased          modestly in the quarter, while output at utilities rose appreciably, led          by a solid advance in electricity generation that mirrored the strengthening          in the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilization was unchanged in December          and remained well below its long-term average.  Sales of light vehicles jumped in December, and the fourth-quarter average,          although below the torrid third-quarter pace, was well above that recorded          for the first half of the year. These data, along with those on retail          sales excluding autos, were consistent with a solid increase in real personal          consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal          income advanced smartly in November. Spending was also supported by the          recent stock market gains, and by greater consumer confidence as reflected          in the Michigan Survey Research Center’s index of consumer sentiment          and the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence, both of          which stood significantly above their average readings for 2003.   Activity in the housing market remained very robust. In December, single-family          starts edged down only a bit from the exceptional rate they had reached          in November, and multifamily starts moved up to the highest level in almost          four years. New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive          month, but they were still not far below the record highs registered earlier          in the year. Existing home sales had fallen back from September’s          high, though the level in November was still noticeably higher than average          monthly sales in the first half of 2003.   The available data suggested that business purchases of transportation          equipment strengthened in the fourth quarter and that spending on other          capital goods advanced at a moderate pace. Business expenditures on aircraft          rebounded noticeably in the fourth quarter, albeit to a level that was          still far below the levels that prevailed before the downturn following          the terrorist attacks in 2001. Both fleet sales of light vehicles and          truck sales also rose significantly. In the high-tech sector, real outlays          for computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted          sizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications          equipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth.          Outside transportation and high tech, nominal shipments were about unchanged          in the fourth quarter, but the upward trend in orders established since          the beginning of last year was consistent with further gains in spending.          After holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real          spending on private nonresidential construction appeared to have slipped          further in the third and fourth quarters. In the commercial and health-care          sector and in the manufacturing sector, average nominal outlays in October          and November were about unchanged from the previous quarter. However,          spending on other types of construction moved down.  The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor          vehicles posted the third consecutive significant monthly increase in          November. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little on average in October          and November, but non-auto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories          at a brisk pace. Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-sales          ratios at or near their recent lows. Motor vehicle and parts inventories          ended the year noticeably above the level at the end of the third quarter.          The international trade deficit in November shrank to its lowest level          in about a year. Exports of goods and services increased to a level not          recorded since early 2001, while imports fell moderately. Recent data          indicated that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign industrial          countries continued in the fourth quarter. Japanese exports, machinery          orders, and industrial production rose strongly in October and November.          Euro-area manufacturing data exhibited increasing strength, particularly          in Germany. In the United Kingdom, indicators of business and retail sales          in December pointed to a maintained expansion. And Canadian employment          and sales data were strong in the fourth quarter, with the housing sector          continuing to make a significant contribution to growth.   Prices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued          to decelerate through the end of 2003. Overall consumer prices were flat,          on balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices          and a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy          prices. Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase          that was noticeably below that in the previous year. Core consumer prices          decelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year. Producer          prices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance          was substantially above that over the previous year. The rise last year          was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices          as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over          2002. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production          or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in          the twelve months ending in December, an increase somewhat below that          over 2002.   At its meeting on December 9, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee          (FOMC) adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve          markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.          In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the          upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for          the next few quarters to be roughly equal. They also judged that the probability          of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and          now appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Nevertheless,          with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed          that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.  The Committee’s decision at the December meeting to keep its target          for the federal funds rate at 1 percent appeared to have been fully anticipated          in financial markets, and interest rate futures for the first half of          2004 were essentially unchanged after the announcement. But futures rates          for the second half of the year rose a few basis points, presumably in          response to the Committee’s assessment that the probability of an          unwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level          almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Subsequently, however, the          release of the minutes for the October FOMC meeting, which indicated that          at that time the Committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent          slack arising from rapid productivity growth, and the publication of surprisingly          modest growth in employment in December led most market participants to          push back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months          to some time in the fall. Reflecting the change in policy expectations,          intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially          over the intermeeting period. Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell by          nearly as much, suggesting that the drop in nominal yields owed more to          lower real interest rates than to reduced inflation compensation. Yields          on investment-grade and most speculative-grade securities moved down by          about the same amount as Treasury yields. Major equity indexes rose strongly          in response to the declines in yields and positive news about the outlook          for profits.   The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies          index, declined moderately on net over the intermeeting period. Ongoing          investor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its          current account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting          pressure on the dollar.  M2 fell in December, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The decline          in M2 over the fourth quarter was the largest on record since the start          of consistent data collection in 1959. The weakness was concentrated in          liquid deposits and, to a lesser extent, in retail money market mutual          funds and appeared to be due in large part to the unwinding of a previous          buildup in deposits associated with heavy mortgage refinancing activity          and to portfolio shifts by households into equities.   The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum          in economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would          carry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing          gains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement          in labor market conditions. The considerable stimulus being provided by          fiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on          a solid uptrend. In addition, improving labor market conditions and the          effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected          to support household spending, while business investment spending was          seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output,          swelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions. Some slight          downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in          the forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets.  In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic          developments, the members commented that the information that had become          available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier          assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic          growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the          year progressed. Many emphasized that business expenditures now appeared          to be on a solid upward trajectory amid widespread reports of much improved          business sentiment. Indeed, business expenditures had broadened the sources          of significant strength in the expansion, which earlier had been sustained          mainly by household and government spending. Factors underlying a favorable          outlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal          and monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets,          and the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business          investment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes. The members          nonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic          activity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in          employment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor          markets. Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth,          they saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward.          Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins          of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and          prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity. Core          consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number          of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such          inflation from its current subdued level. Over the year ahead, however,          the members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price          inflation.  In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserve’s          semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy,          the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal          Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP,          the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004.          The forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth          in economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite          low rate of inflation. Specifically, the forecasts of the expansion in          real GDP between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of          2004 had a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent and a full range of          4 to 5-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate          in the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.          Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the          PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent,          with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent.   In their discussion of developments across the nation, members emphasized          growing indications of rising business confidence and, despite persisting          softness in a number of industries, more widespread signs of increasing          business spending for equipment and software and for inventories. The          members cited a variety of factors that pointed to a further pickup in          business capital expenditures over the coming year, including the strength          in new orders and shipments, increasing profits and cash flow, the improved          financial condition of many business firms, the general availability of          financing on favorable terms, and the temporary tax incentive on expenditures          for new equipment. Anecdotal reports from business contacts about capital          spending plans were indicative of appreciable further acceleration in          business expenditures on a widening range of capital goods. While many          contacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities          provided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors          in guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment          spending to expand capacity.   The members also viewed business inventory investment as likely to provide          some support to the economic expansion over the year ahead. Business inventories          were at exceptionally low levels in relation to sales, and if further          brisk growth in demand broadly in line with current forecasts materialized          this year, business firms could be expected to make commensurate additions          to their inventories. Indeed, inventories appeared to have turned up in          the fourth quarter after declining on balance earlier in 2003 as businesses          evidently became more confident that increases in their sales would be          sustained.   While business expenditures had turned up, employers had continued to          display a high degree of caution in hiring new workers. Employment had          trended up since mid-2003 after a protracted period of job losses, but          the gains were significantly weaker than was typical at similar stages          of earlier business cycles. A key factor that had tended to hold down          hiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing          demand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than          hiring new workers. Against this background, labor markets continued to          be described as soft in most areas, albeit with more signs of at least          modest improvement. In this regard, members referred to positive developments          such as the decline in initial claims and the rise in aggregate hours          worked in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the members saw considerably          faster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further          strengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in          the growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters.          Several emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement          in employment were subject to considerable uncertainty.   The household sector was continuing to supply major impetus to the expansion.          Household spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary          policies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices,          and increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook. Members          noted that retailers in many parts of the country reported solid sales          during the holiday period. With respect to the outlook for overall consumer          spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could          be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption          even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded. Residential construction          activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent          declines in mortgage interest rates. Contacts in the housing industry          indicated that they expected a high level of construction activity in          2004, though perhaps not as robust as in 2003.  Fiscal policy was providing considerable stimulus to the economy and          would continue to do so in the first part of this year, reflecting the          large tax refunds anticipated as a result of overwithholdings in 2003.          Beyond the nearer term, however, the fiscal stimulus was projected to          diminish under existing legislation. In this regard, one member questioned          whether a robust expansion would be sustained once the fiscal impulse          was removed. Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects          for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance          of the economy.  In their comments about the international economy, members noted that          the strengthening in economic activity abroad and the decline in the foreign          exchange value of the dollar had boosted exports. Even so, the ongoing          strength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and          net exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic          activity over the year ahead. Some members indicated that they were concerned          about the implications of the nation’s rapidly growing external          debt for domestic financial markets and the economy over time.  In the Committee’s discussion of the outlook for inflation, the          members agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain          muted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually          reducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity          exerting downward pressure on costs and prices. Some members commented,          however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was          quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.          Accordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price          inflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion          about the most probable direction. In the view of many, some modest further          disinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect. A few members noted          that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity,          could be viewed as non-threatening. Moreover, the expected strength in          aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time. A few          members expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well          edge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus          stemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility          that the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially          if it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated          with slower growth in productivity. The evidence pointing to the possibility          of an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted          that in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities          including oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms          had been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher          levels in an effort to pass on increases in costs. Overall, however, the          pricing power of business firms remained quite limited.   In the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period          ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance that was directed          toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with a target federal          funds rate of 1 percent. While the members were persuaded that a relatively          vigorous economic expansion was now firmly established and was likely          at some point to call for a move toward a more neutral policy stance,          they concluded that such an adjustment was not warranted under current          circumstances. In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other          resources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level,          and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction          over the year ahead. Members acknowledged that there were risks in maintaining          what might eventually prove to be an overly accommodative policy stance,          but for now they judged that it was desirable to take risks on the side          of assuring the rapid elimination of economic slack.  With regard to the wording of the Committee’s press statement          to be released shortly after the meeting, members discussed at some length          the desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the          prospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained “for a          considerable period.” The existing language had been explicitly          qualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack          in resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from          the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions          rather than simply on the passage of time. All the members agreed that          a change in wording was desirable, not to signal a policy tightening move          in the near term, but rather to increase the Committee’s flexibility          to take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline          that any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic          conditions. However, some differences of opinion arose with regard to          the specific proposal under consideration, namely to remove the reference          to “considerable period” and to substitute one referring to          “patience.” Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed          that the new wording conveyed important information about the Committee’s          strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under          those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial          markets. A number of members commented that expectations of sustained          policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial          markets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording          might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic          circumstances in the future. A few members, while expressing agreement          with respect to the merits of a language change, nonetheless preferred          to drop the reference to a “considerable period’’ entirely          without substituting a reference to the Committee’s ability to be          patient. In this view, even the replacement language would tend to shape          expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy, and          with the economy in a strong uptrend, the Committee no longer needed to          utilize such special language.   At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee voted to authorize and          direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,          to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following          domestic policy directive:   The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions            that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.            To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future            seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the            federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.    The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in          the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:   The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the            attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly            equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished            in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.            With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes            that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,            Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kohn, Ms. Minehan,            Mr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole.  Vote against this action: None.    It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Tuesday, March 16, 2004. The meeting
