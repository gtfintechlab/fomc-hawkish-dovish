 reported on recent developments          in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign          currencies for the         System's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager          also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System          open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations          during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee          ratified these transactions.  At this meeting the Committee reviewed and discussed staff presentations          on the topic of housing valuations and monetary policy. Prices of houses          in the United States had risen sharply in recent years, especially in          certain areas of the country, to very high levels relative to incomes          or rents. In addition to local market factors, a wide range of influences          appeared to be supporting home prices, including solid gains in disposable          income, low mortgage rates, and financial innovation in the residential          mortgage market. Prices might be somewhat above the levels consistent          with these underlying factors, but measuring the extent of any overvaluation          either nationally or in regional markets posed considerable conceptual          and statistical difficulties. Meeting participants noted that the rise          in house prices had been accompanied by a modest shift toward potentially          riskier types of mortgages, including adjustable-rate and interest-only          loans, which could pose challenges to both lenders and borrowers. Nonetheless,          financial institutions generally remained in a comfortable capital position,          such loans had performed well thus far, much of the associated risk had          been transferred to other investors through securitization, and valuations          had risen more rapidly than mortgage debt on average--so that loan-to-value          ratios had fallen.   The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy          was expanding at a moderate pace in the second quarter. Housing activity          remained at a high level, business investment appeared to have improved          some after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter, and manufacturing          picked up notably in May. Supported by a rebound in motor vehicle purchases,          consumer spending appeared on track to post another moderate gain for          the quarter. Labor demand continued to expand, and the unemployment rate          edged down further in May. Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May,          but crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in          the spring.   Averaging through a large gain in April and a more modest increase in          May, growth in payroll employment was on par with that over the preceding          six months. Payrolls expanded in line with their recent trends in the          construction, transportation and utilities, and nonbusiness services sectors,          while hiring in financial services slowed a bit, and the manufacturing          sector posted further small losses of jobs. The average workweek of production          or nonsupervisory workers edged up over the two-month period, helping          to boost aggregate hours to the highest level since early 2001. The unemployment          rate dipped to 5.1 percent in May. Meanwhile, the labor force participation          rate moved up a bit, suggesting that the labor market had strengthened          enough to attract some individuals back into the workforce. Survey indicators          and the continued relatively low level of initial claims for unemployment          insurance also supported the notion of continued improvement in the labor          market.  Industrial production declined in April, owing to a dip in utilities          output, but widespread gains in manufacturing output in May offset that          loss. On net, industrial production was little changed over April and          May; capacity utilization generally followed the same pattern as output.  Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing at          a moderate pace this quarter, though a bit below that of the first quarter.          Purchases of motor vehicles rebounded smartly after declining in the first          quarter. Excluding motor vehicles, however, the expansion of real consumer          outlays likely slowed of late, against a backdrop of modest gains in real          income. Recent measures of consumer confidence improved from their levels          earlier in the spring, when higher gasoline prices and concerns about          a slowing in the pace of the economic expansion may have served as restraining          influences.  Activity in the housing sector remained robust. Single-family starts          averaged more than 1.65 million units at an annual rate in April and May,          not much below the very strong first-quarter pace. Sales of both new and          existing homes remained at a high level in May. While prices of existing          homes continued to increase rapidly, new home prices showed signs of decelerating.          Available indicators suggested that, with the ongoing support of low mortgage          rates, the housing sector remained strong in June.   Spending on equipment and software registered a solid increase in the          first quarter, and the available data suggested that second-quarter spending          was continuing at a slightly faster pace. Shipments of nondefense capital          goods posted sizable increases in recent months, although gains in orders          were more uneven. Broadly speaking, the fundamentals continued to support          business investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporate          balance sheets healthy. Outlays for construction of nonresidential structures          appeared to have picked up some, but the level of such investment remained          subdued. And although spending on commercial structures had moved up in          recent months, outlays for office buildings were still at depressed levels,          and expenditures on manufacturing and other facilities were lackluster.  The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories continued to grow          in April, but more slowly than in the first quarter. With these increases,          the inventory-sales ratio fell back in April after moving up a little          in the first quarter.  After reaching a record high relative to GDP in February, the U.S. international          trade deficit narrowed in March, but widened again in April. While the          value of exports of goods and services increased in both months, the value          of imports of goods and services jumped in April, more than offsetting          a decline in March. GDP growth in most major foreign industrial economies          picked up slightly in the first quarter, but recent economic indicators          for the major foreign economies in the second quarter were mixed.  Consumer prices were about unchanged in May after posting large increases          in the previous few months. Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed          part of their earlier run-up. Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared          to have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year.          Despite this moderation, measures of core consumer price inflation over          the past year were somewhat above those for the comparable period a year          ago. The producer price index rose sharply in April, but dropped back          again in May, driven largely by a swing in the food and energy components.          According to recent surveys, both near-term and longer-term inflation          expectations had changed little over the past two months, and market measures          of inflation compensation had moved lower. With regard to labor costs,          growth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector in the first          quarter was estimated to have slowed some after advancing notably in the          fourth quarter; the first quarter increase was broadly similar to those          posted during the middle of last year.   At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase          the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3 percent.          In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception          that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside          risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability          should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that recent data          suggested that the solid pace of spending growth had slowed somewhat,          partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices, but that          labor market conditions apparently continued to improve gradually. While          pressures on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power          was more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained.          In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation          could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that          it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill          its obligation to maintain price stability.  The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate          target 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks          to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and          to retain the "measured pace" language was widely expected in financial          markets. The publication of the minutes three weeks later also contained          few surprises for investors and elicited little market reaction. Market          expectations for the future path of policy ended the period higher in          the near term but lower at longer horizons. Nominal Treasury yields followed          the shift in policy expectations, with near-term yields higher and longer-term          yields modestly lower, on net. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds          were little changed over the intermeeting period, but spreads on speculative-grade          bonds contracted notably. Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates          and largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably          over the intermeeting period. The positive economic data also seemed to          lift the dollar against major foreign currencies, though the dollar's          moves against individual currencies varied widely.  M2 edged lower over April and May as the opportunity cost of holding          M2 assets rose further. Liquid deposits were especially weak, owing to          the slow adjustment of yields paid on these deposits to increases in market          rates. Despite the recent softness in M2, its velocity remained quite          low relative to its historical relationships with opportunity cost. Bank          credit decelerated sharply in April and May from rapid gains posted in          the first quarter, as growth in both securities and loans fell.  In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen          as likely to expand this year and next at a rate just above its potential.          The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected          to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an          abatement of energy-related headwinds. Household spending was expected          to firm going forward as real income posts solid gains attributable in          part to the ongoing improvement in the labor market. Business investment          was projected to benefit from the combination of favorable prospects for          sales, supportive financial markets, and the ongoing need to replace or          upgrade aging equipment and software. A slightly larger portion of domestic          demand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period.          The forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation          seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher          import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices,          and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane.  In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,          many meeting participants noted that incoming data had been reassuring          about the strength of the expansion. Following some softer readings earlier          in the year, incoming spending and production data over the intermeeting          period indicated that the expansion remained firm, led by residential          and business investment. In addition, labor market conditions continued          to strengthen gradually. The economy evidently had been resilient in the          face of rising energy prices, and financial conditions remained accommodative,          supporting growth going forward. Increases in core consumer prices had          slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting          participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled          in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices. However,          the impetus to inflation from the prices of oil and other commodities          was expected to wane, and long-term inflation expectations apparently          remained well-anchored. With some limited remaining slack in labor markets          likely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of          policy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained.  In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress          on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents          of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth          of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for          2005 and 2006. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were          concentrated in the upper part of a 3 to 3-3/4 percent range for 2005,          and the forecasts for 2006 were concentrated at the lower end of a range          of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent. These rates of growth were associated          with a civilian unemployment rate of 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth          quarter of this year and a rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of          2006. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE          price index, were mainly near the middle of a 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent          range this year and somewhat below the middle of a range of 1-1/2          to 2-1/2 percent next year.   In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy,          meeting participants noted that the fundamentals underlying household          spending remained firm. With rising home and equity prices buoying household          wealth, consumer expenditures continued to advance. Although the recent          surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time,          consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going          forward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets.          Increased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some          parts of the country, but robust demand for new homes owed in large part          to the ongoing economic expansion and low long-term interest rates.  Business outlays for capital goods continued to rise, and the outlook          for investment spending remained solid, supported by increased sales,          low interest rates, robust profits, and strong business balance sheets.          Anecdotal reports from industry contacts generally pointed to planned          increases in investment spending, though in some regions businesses apparently          remained cautious about the outlook. Conditions in the commercial real          estate sector, which had been weak for some time, were said to have improved          in some parts of the nation.   Several meeting participants expressed some concern about domestic and          global imbalances. Large federal budget deficits were expected to persist          despite an increase in tax receipts in recent months. These deficits were          contributing to a low level of national saving that would, if not corrected          over time, ultimately constrain investment and overall economic growth.          Moreover, U.S. trade deficits were expected to remain large going forward,          reflecting both the low level of U.S. saving and relatively slow growth          in some of our trading partners. Uncertainties regarding the nature and          timing of the potential correction of these imbalances complicated the          assessment of the intermediate-term prospects for the U.S. economy.  In their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants'          comments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest          rates and the continued run-up in home prices. Despite substantial cumulative          policy tightening over the past year, long-term Treasury yields had moved          considerably lower, implying a significant flattening of the yield curve          (measured as the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields).          Lower compensation for inflation accounted for a portion of the decline          in longer-term nominal yields, but a larger portion reflected reductions          in real yields. Participants cited a variety of factors as possibly contributing          to the unusual behavior of long-term rates over this period. For one,          investors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen          as likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line          with potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative          to saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U.S.          growth. However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with          higher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets. The          behavior of long-term interest rates could also reflect reduced uncertainty          on the part of investors about the economic outlook -- as seen in low          readings of implied volatility in bond and equity markets. Finally, demands          for longer-term U.S. securities by both domestic and foreign investors          might have been boosted by special factors. Confidence about the economic          outlook and low market interest rates--along with possibly outsized expectations          of capital gains in some markets--could also help to account for the high          level of home prices the Committee had discussed on the first day of the          meeting. It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook          for both long-term interest rates and home prices.  With regard to any role for monetary policy in responding to possible          imbalances in housing or bond markets, meeting participants stressed the          importance of the pursuit of their core objectives of price stability          and maximum sustainable economic growth. To the extent that an asset price          movement threatened the achievement of those objectives, it would of course          be taken into consideration in setting policy. However, given the unavoidable          uncertainties associated with judgments regarding the appropriate level          of and likely future movements in asset prices, a strategy of responding          more directly to possible mispricing was seen as very unlikely to contribute,          on balance, to the achievement of the Committee's objectives over time.          Participants' views on the inflation outlook were mixed. Thus far in          2005, core consumer price inflation had been higher than most participants          had expected at the start of the year, reflecting, at least in part, the          pass-through effects of higher energy, commodity, and import prices. While          such shocks could be expected to boost inflation temporarily, some participants          expressed concern that, with policy still accommodative, the underlying          pace of inflation might be in the process of stepping up, perhaps to a          level that was at the upper end of the range that they viewed as compatible          with the Committee's price stability objective. The degree of slack remaining          in labor and resource markets was very uncertain, and unit labor costs          in the nonfarm business sector had moved notably higher in recent quarters.          Trend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural          productivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants          thought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back          in coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years.          And with higher energy prices already eating into profit margins at firms          outside the energy sector, increases in unit labor costs might be more          likely to be passed through into prices.   While agreeing that inflation developments had to be watched carefully,          other meeting participants emphasized that recent core inflation data          had been relatively restrained, and anecdotal reports suggested that pricing          power at many firms remained quite limited. Moreover, readings from futures          markets suggested that oil prices would likely flatten out, so their effect          on inflation should gradually ebb. Similarly, prices of other commodities          and imports, which had surged for a time, were now moderating. Survey          and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest          that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist. Finally,          while the degree of slack in labor markets was uncertain, total labor          compensation had probably been boosted temporarily around the turn of          the year by special factors, and the recent behavior of a range of other          indicators of labor costs appeared consistent with some remaining slack          that would likely tend to restrain inflation pressures. Moreover, anecdotal          reports of labor market conditions continued to point to shortages of          labor only for certain, mostly skilled, occupations.   In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, all          members agreed on a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds          rate to 3-1/4 percent. Economic growth remained firm, while rising          energy, and possibly labor, costs threatened to put upward pressure on          inflation. Even with this action, the federal funds rate remained below          the level members anticipated would prove necessary in the long run to          contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential. However, the          pace and extent of future policy moves would depend on incoming data.          In considering the statement to be released following this meeting,          members concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices,          the expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually.          All also thought that the statement should note the continued pressures          on inflation, while mentioning that long-term inflation expectations remained          well contained. With policy still seen as accommodative, members agreed          that the statement should retain an assessment that the risks to both          sustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced, conditional          on appropriate policy action. Members also agreed that the statement language          indicating that "policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is          likely to be measured" correctly characterized the outlook for policy          for now. The members concurred that at this stage in the expansion, with          margins of slack resources narrowing and inflation somewhat higher, the          Committee needed to be particularly alert to signs of a further increase          in inflation. Such an increase could be particularly problematic because          it might impart upward momentum to inflation expectations that would be          costly to reverse. In any case, additional tightening would probably be          necessary, but views differed on the amount of tightening that would likely          be required to keep inflation contained and bring output in line with          potential. However, members agreed that there was no need to make such          an assessment at this time, and that the appropriate pace and degree of          cumulative policy adjustment would depend on economic developments going          forward. With the forward-looking language in the statement clearly conditioned          on the outlook, it was not seen as limiting the Committee's flexibility          in responding to such developments.   At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize          and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed          otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance          with the following domestic policy directive:    "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions            that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.            To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future            seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal            funds rate to an average of around 3-1/4 percent."         The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the        statement        to be released shortly after the meeting:  "The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy          action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable          growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying          inflation expected to be contained, the          Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace          that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond          to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to          maintain price stability."  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan and Geithner,          Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Fisher, Gramlich, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Santomero,          and Stern.  Votes against this action: None. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Tuesday, August 9, 2005.   The meeting
