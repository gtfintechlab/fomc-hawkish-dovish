 reported on recent developments          in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign          currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.        The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets          and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities          issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period October          28, 2003, through December 8, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified          these transactions.        Real GDP appeared to be advancing at a solid rate in the fourth quarter,          albeit well below its extraordinary pace in the third quarter. Consumer          spending appeared to be on a flatter trajectory, but spending for equipment          and software and residential construction continued to surge. Meanwhile,          the labor market had finally shown signs of some improvement in recent          months, and activity in the industrial sector was continuing to rise.          Consumer price inflation remained quiescent: The twelve-month change in          core consumer prices was notably lower than the increase during the preceding          year.        Private nonfarm payrolls rose moderately in November, although by less          than the substantial gains in September and October. The increases in          November were fairly widespread, with notable advances in temporary help          services, nonbusiness services, and construction. Although employment          continued to fall in manufacturing, the losses had tapered off since the          first half of the year. The average workweek and aggregate hours worked          by nonfarm employees increased significantly, and the average level of          nonfarm employee hours in October and November was noticeably above the          average in the third quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent          in November, down from a recent peak of 6.4 percent at midyear.        Industrial production grew solidly in the third quarter, and the momentum          continued in October apart from the production of motor vehicles and parts,          which fell back from an elevated third-quarter level. High-tech output          accelerated in the third quarter to the fastest pace since the middle          of 2000, and production gains continued at a rapid pace in October. Outside          the manufacturing sector, unseasonably warm weather contributed to an          increase in output at utilities in October, while mining production declined          a bit, largely reflecting a decrease in the production of crude oil. Capacity          utilization edged up in October but remained well below its longer-term          average.        Consumer spending slipped a little on balance in September and October          after soaring in July and August. Much of the recent decline was the result          of a pullback in purchases of motor vehicles; elsewhere, expenditures          were about unchanged in September and rose modestly in October. Spending          was supported by the upturn in employment, continued impetus from the          recently enacted tax cuts, improved confidence, and a level of wealth          that was considerably above that of earlier in the year.        Housing activity surged in October. Single-family housing starts reached          a record high, while multifamily starts moved down but remained in line          with the average pace during the previous two years. Sales of existing          single-family homes in October were only a bit below the record level          set in September. The pace of new home sales also remained brisk in October,          albeit down somewhat from September.        The data on orders for, and shipments of, nondefense capital goods through          October suggested continued momentum in spending on equipment and software,          which grew in the third quarter at the fastest pace since 1998. Robust          gains in spending were posted in the third quarter in all the major categories          except aircraft. The gains were associated with recent increases in business          output and corporate cash flow and with a decline this year in the user          cost of capital. Shipments of high-tech equipment climbed further in October,          while shipments in other nondefense sectors excluding aircraft edged down.          New orders of nondefense equipment excluding aircraft in October continued          the upward trend in place since the beginning of the year and were consistent          with ongoing gains in equipment spending. Outlays for the construction          of private-sector nonresidential buildings fell a bit in October, but          the extended contraction in spending on nonresidential construction appeared          to be ending. Nominal spending on office space edged up in September and          October, while outlays for the construction of other commercial buildings          moved lower. Expenditures on institutional buildings changed little in          recent months.        Real nonfarm inventories fell moderately in the third quarter after declining          substantially in the second. Manufacturers liquidated stocks by a larger          amount in the third quarter than in the previous quarter but added slightly          to their inventories in October. Wholesalers and retailers (excluding          those selling motor vehicles and parts) built up inventories in the third          quarter, and, for wholesalers, the stockbuilding continued in October          (data on retail inventories in October were unavailable). Still, inventory-sales          ratios in all three categories declined a bit further in the third quarter          from already very low levels.        The international trade deficit increased in September as imports of          goods and services rose more than exports. Recent data suggested that          a recovery had taken hold in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth          in real GDP picked up in the third quarter in the euro area, the United          Kingdom, and Canada, and indicators in Japan were consistent with continued          economic expansion.        Core consumer price inflation remained subdued in October, although it          was up from even lower levels in the first part of the year, when it was          depressed by transitory factors. Over the twelve months ending in October,          core consumer prices rose only slightly and noticeably less than in the          previous twelve-month period. Total twelve-month consumer inflation was          unchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices.          Producer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually          large increases in October, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the          prices of motor vehicles. Twelve-month core producer price inflation,          however, was on balance unchanged over the year ending October, although          the twelve-month change in overall producer prices stood well above its          year-earlier level owing to a jump in food and energy price inflation.          With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production          or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose slightly in          the twelve months ending in November; the increase was a bit below that          in the previous twelve months. By contrast, the increase in the employment          cost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve          months ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting          a pickup in benefit costs.        At its meeting of October 28, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee          adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve          markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.          In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the          upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for          the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability,          though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a          rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judged that,          on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remained the          predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In those circumstances,          the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for          a considerable period.        The Committee's decision at the October meeting to leave its target for          the federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, and rates          on near-dated federal funds futures were virtually unchanged. However,          the Committee's retention of both an unchanged risk assessment and its          indication that policy could remain accommodative for a considerable period,          which market participants apparently had seen as less certain outcomes,          precipitated a brief rally in Treasury markets. Over the intermeeting          period as a whole, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields were          basically unchanged. Upward movements in response to data releases showing          an economy building momentum were offset by the market response to several          statements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain accommodative          and to the November employment report, which included a smaller gain in          private nonfarm payrolls than market participants had expected. Yields          on investment-grade corporate securities were also essentially unchanged,          while yields on speculative-grade securities declined, continuing the          narrowing of their risk spreads. Major equity indexes were up moderately          over the intermeeting period.        The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies          index, declined somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar          had appreciated in late October and early November following several stronger-than-expected          U.S. economic data releases. But the dollar depreciated, on net, over          the remainder of the intermeeting period, reflecting concerns about an          escalation of trade frictions prompted by the U.S. imposition of import          quotas on Chinese textiles, the ability of the United States to continue          to finance its current account deficit, and risks stemming from developments          in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey.        M2 contracted significantly in November for the third consecutive month.          A sizable part of the declines in these three months appeared to be due          to the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and the resulting reductions          in associated deposit balances. In addition, rising equity markets may          have made M2 accounts relatively less attractive.        The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the economic          expansion was likely to be sufficiently robust to reduce economic slack          substantially in coming quarters. Accommodative financial conditions,          fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would          continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending          over the months ahead. In addition, businesses appeared to be shedding          some of the caution that had characterized their behavior for the previous          three years. As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher,          the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening          of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data          were projected to continue. Even though the unemployment rate was projected          to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core          consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing          slack in resource utilization.        In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments,          members referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic          expansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched. The members noted          that spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of          tax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane. And with business confidence          on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had          revived. While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of          the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected          growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets          over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors          supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies,          accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence,          a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker          dollar and pickup in growth abroad. While downside risks to the outlook          had diminished, some members remained concerned that spending could slow          somewhat next year as the effects of fiscal stimulus and mortgage refinancing          faded. Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and          so weigh on consumer confidence. With relatively strong economic growth          nonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation          as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year.        In their comments about recent developments around the nation, members          reported improving economic conditions in virtually all regions, with          strength in household spending increasingly augmented by gains in business          outlays. Consumer spending remained firm, and residential construction          continued at a high level. Committee members' business contacts generally          expressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained,          and they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment          going forward. Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in          the rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors          and employment displayed signs of stabilizing. Some members reported an          easing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal          reports suggested that competition, including especially competition from          foreign producers, continued to constrain pricing.        In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the          economy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in          business spending in recent quarters would continue. It now appeared that          the increase in outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter          was even larger than had been thought, and data on orders and shipments,          as well as anecdotal reports, pointed to further increases. These gains          owed to rising business confidence, substantial gains in profits and cash          flow, and accommodative financial markets. In addition, businesses were          expected to step up investment outlays next year in advance of the expiration          of temporary tax incentives. Some members noted that the commercial real          estate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling          rents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted          demand for office and retail space.        An easing of business caution was also suggested by growing indications          that business firms were shifting from inventory liquidation to restocking.          With the level of inventories still quite low relative to sales and sales          expected to strengthen further, a number of members noted that inventory          investment could be expected to contribute to growth in aggregate demand          in coming quarters.        Household spending had remained solid even as the effects of tax refunds          and mortgage refinancing, which had boosted spending substantially in          the summer, waned. While consumption spending had slowed earlier in the          fall, retail contacts suggested some strengthening more recently and reported          that holiday sales appeared to be running somewhat above last year's pace.          Looking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported          by further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in          the first half of next year. And with the expansion picking up momentum,          the risk of a slowdown in such spending clearly seemed to have diminished.          Some members pointed, however, to signs of increased financial stress          that could limit the ability of many households to hold spending at recent          levels, especially if incomes did not rise at a robust pace in line with          current forecasts. In the housing sector, activity remained elevated despite          some increase in mortgage rates since early summer.        Members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which          had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would          slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases          in state and local spending. Although fiscal policy more generally would          probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect          was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were          likely to persist. Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern          about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets          and the economy.        In their remarks about the external sector of the economy, members noted          that an improvement in the economic outlook in many foreign economies,          as well as the lower dollar, was likely to foster a pickup in exports.          While some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster          growth in the United States, domestic demand in several major trading          partners appeared to be strengthening. Nonetheless, the value of U.S.          imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin,          and the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction          added to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy.        In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated          that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods          markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with          a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct          possibility. Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on          prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently          quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which          would reduce labor costs. In addition, some members noted that the current          unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since          the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late,          and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level          of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages.          However, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation          were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and          the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced          weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small          - was now regarded by most as virtually nil. Indeed, the weaker dollar,          higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were          seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices          even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had          not had a large effect on retail prices in the past. Members also expressed          concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations          given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that          seemed to be gathering momentum. Some noted that the rise in recent months          in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields          on nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in          this direction. Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered          the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on          the downside for the next few quarters.        In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead,          all the members favored an unchanged policy that continued to incorporate          a target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The data and anecdotal          evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members          more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.          Nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance          remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation,          wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable          uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down.          In these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain          subdued well into the future. To be sure, the Committee needed to remain          attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared          to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted          such a move. At some point, a move in the direction of a less accommodative          and more neutral policy posture might well be necessary should the apparently          vigorous expansion continue and over time promote fuller utilization of          resources. For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit          in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking          preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation,          with associated costs to economic performance.        In their discussion of the announcement to be issued shortly after this          meeting, the members agreed that in addition to updating to reflect recent          economic developments, some rewording was needed to reflect their evolving          assessment of the risks to the economy. In light of the recent acceleration          in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth          ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed          assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had          diminished appreciably. While a number of members saw some slight further          disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material          change in inflation. All could agree that the risks of further disinflation          were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.          In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no          longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks          to growth and inflation taken together.        Views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining          an accommodative monetary policy "for a considerable period." A number          of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's          flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed          appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances. A majority,          however, preferred to retain the phrase, at least for now. They noted          that the changes in their assessment of risk would convey the evolving          views of the Committee and they believed the "considerable period" reference          still accurately conveyed the Committee's policy intentions. Given the          decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit          in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically          the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed          to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.        At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize          and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed          otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance          with the following domestic policy directive.         "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions            that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.            To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future            seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the            federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent."   The vote encompassed the following statements concerning the risks to          the Committee's outlook for economic growth and inflation. These statements          would be included in the press release to be made available shortly after          the meeting.         The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment            of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The            probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent            months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.           Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,            Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn,            Moskow, Olson, and Parry.  Vote against this action: None.   At this meeting Mr. Ferguson reported on the progress of the working          group that was charged at the October 28 meeting with developing some          specific proposals regarding how best to communicate the Committee's assessment          of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The working group          had solicited and received comments from the members of the Board of Governors          and from the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks regarding potential          approaches for improving communications with the public and enhancing          thereby the latter's understanding of monetary policy decisions. It was          agreed that the working group, with the assistance of staff at the Board          of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks, would prepare more detailed          proposals together with supporting staff documentation for consideration          at a later meeting of the Committee.        It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Tuesday- Wednesday, January 27-28, 2004.        The meeting
