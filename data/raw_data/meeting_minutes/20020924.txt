 reported on recent developments          in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign          currencies for the System’s account in the period since the previous          meeting.         The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets          and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities          issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period August          13, 2002, through September 23, 2002. By unanimous vote, the Committee          ratified these transactions.         The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial          outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period          ahead.        The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the economy          continued to expand in the third quarter, though the tenor of incoming          reports was mixed. Data on household and business spending had been solid          for the most part, and residential construction remained high. Motor vehicle          production provided a sizable boost to economic activity, but other factory          output changed little on net. Employment continued to expand unevenly,          while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend. Overall price          inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments          in the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation.        Aggregate labor market conditions had been mixed in recent months. While          nonfarm payroll employment registered further small gains in July and          August, the aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers          declined on balance over the two-month period. The manufacturing and retail          trade sectors registered sharp job losses in August, but those were more          than offset by hiring in the services and construction sectors. A hefty          increase in government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels also          boosted payroll employment. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.7          percent in August despite advances in claims for unemployment insurance.        Industrial production declined in August, largely offsetting July’s          rise. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output was unchanged in          both July and August after sizable advances in the first half of the year.          Production in the high-tech sector jumped in August, the manufacture of          aircraft and parts fell further, and output in the remainder of the industrial          sector was mixed. Capacity utilization in manufacturing changed little          in August and was substantially below its long-run average.        Retail sales remained relatively brisk in August despite further decreases          in stock prices and consumer confidence. Households boosted their already          high level of spending on motor vehicles in response to zero percent financing          and larger cash incentives offered by auto manufacturers, and household          purchases of goods other than motor vehicles continued to advance at a          moderate pace. According to the latest available data, outlays for services          rose moderately in July.        Residential housing activity slowed a little in July and August from          the robust pace of the second quarter as further declines in mortgage          rates apparently helped to support housing activity in an environment          of sluggish employment and diminishing household wealth. Starts of single-family          units fell in August to their lowest rate since last November, while starts          in the multifamily sector in the July-August period were at their average          rate for the first half of the year. Sales of new single-family homes          posted a record high in July, and the inventory of unsold new homes remained          low. Sales of existing single-family homes in July partially retraced          a large drop in June.        Based on the limited information available, business investment in equipment          and software seemed to be advancing at a solid pace in the third quarter.          This reflected an acceleration in spending that was associated importantly          with notably stronger motor vehicle sales and a halt to the contraction          in aircraft expenditures. Outside the transportation sector, outlays on          equipment continued to expand at a moderate pace; in addition, the level          of orders in July (latest data) moved above shipments for the first time          since early last year, and the backlog of unfilled orders edged up. Nonresidential          construction activity remained on a steep downtrend in July, with further          reductions of spending in all major categories except office buildings.         The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor          vehicles registered a second straight monthly gain in July after many          months of heavy liquidation. Despite the rise in stocks, gains in sales          and shipments drove inventory-sales ratios to even lower levels across          the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors. Survey and anecdotal          information suggested that few industries were burdened with sizable inventory          overhangs.        The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed appreciably in          July after two quarters of large increases. The smaller deficit in July          reflected continued strong expansion of the value of exports coupled with          a decrease in the value of imports. The step-up in goods exports occurred          mostly in motor vehicles and aircraft, while the gain in exports of services          was spread across travel and other private services. The decline in imports          was concentrated in consumer and capital goods, royalties, and license          fees. The very limited available information on economic activity abroad          in the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro          area and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery          in Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia. Conditions in South          America remained fragile: Economic activity was still very weak in Argentina          and Venezuela, and the Brazilian economy had been adversely affected by          the turbulence in financial markets, though those markets had stabilized          recently. By contrast, Mexico experienced brisk growth in the second quarter.        Despite a slight pickup in consumer price inflation in August, the increase          in consumer prices (measured by either the consumer price index or the          chain-indexed personal consumption expenditure index) for the year ending          in August was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month          period. Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food          and energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably. Producer          prices for core finished goods likewise signaled a drop in inflation over          the last year. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of          production or nonsupervisory workers decelerated sharply over the twelve          months ended in August, reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment          and the drop in consumer price inflation.        At its meeting on August 13, 2002, the Committee retained a directive          that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with          keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent,          but it shifted from a statement of a neutral balance of risks to one that          was tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Market          participants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating          that economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than          had been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while          broad indexes of equity prices moved lower. The following day’s          deadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements passed          uneventfully and equity markets rallied. Subsequently, however, a weaker          tone to incoming data on production and employment, a gloomier outlook          for business profits, and heightening tensions over Iraq seemed to lead          investors to revise down their outlook for the economy. Over the intermeeting          period, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury security yields and broad          equity indexes fell considerably on balance.        In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar          in terms of the major foreign currencies appreciated slightly on balance          over the intermeeting period as projections for growth of foreign industrial          countries, particularly Germany and Japan, were marked down more than          those for the United States. The dollar moved within narrow ranges against          most major currencies but rose somewhat against the yen and the currencies          of other important trading partners.        M2 growth remained elevated in August, though somewhat below July’s          rapid pace. Much of the strength of the aggregate’s liquid components          likely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity          costs of holding such deposits, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing          activity, and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices. Borrowing          by domestic nonfinancial businesses remained weak, likely reflecting reduced          requirements for funds to finance capital spending projects and perhaps          the improved tone in the corporate bond market and a modest increase in          the issuance of corporate debt.         The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light          of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic          activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively          brisk pace late next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus          already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and improving          business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending. Inventory          overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated, and business capital          stocks appeared to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence,          a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs,          and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment          and software were expected to boost business investment spending. However,          a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast          period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than          had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain          below that of the economy’s potential for a longer time. The persistence          of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core          price inflation.        In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic          conditions, members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked          up in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been          mixed, raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going          forward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor          and capital resources. For now, a high degree of business caution in the          context of substantial uncertainties, exacerbated recently by apparently          increased concerns about the geopolitical outlook, continued to restrain          business investment and hiring. Even so, the economy appeared to be well          positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had          been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment          with sales, the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary          policies, and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for          profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes. With          the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the          economy’s potential for some time, pressures on labor and other          resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely          would continue to edge lower.         In their review of developments in and prospects for key sectors of          the economy, members commented that household spending had continued to          be well maintained. Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor          vehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer          months. While survey indicators of consumer confidence had declined this          year, the high levels of consumer spending on homes, motor vehicles, and          other big-ticket items were, in the view of at least some members, perhaps          a better gauge of consumer confidence. The value of homes had continued          to rise in most areas, and unusually low interest rates were inducing          people to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend          some of the embedded equity gains. Increasing home equity values probably          were also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending          of the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market          prices since the spring of 2000. Other positive factors cited as helping          to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions          in federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer          durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero          interest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects          of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes. Looking          ahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over          coming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members          referred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer          and somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number          of retailer contacts. Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment,          should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions          on consumer spending. On balance, consumer spending was seen as likely          to remain a positive but possibly a more limited source of support for          the expansion over the next several quarters.        In the context of sustained growth in incomes, low mortgage interest          rates, by facilitating the extraction of homeowners’ equity, had          played a key role in inducing a high level of spending on residential          structures and home improvement expenditures. Tending to confirm currently          available data on housing activity, members cited persisting anecdotal          reports of robust home sales and residential construction in many regions,          though indications of softening were noted in some areas and market segments,          particularly in the high-price sector of the housing market. Some members          questioned whether generally rising housing prices and elevated levels          of refinancings would persist. However, given the anticipated continuation          of accommodative conditions in mortgage markets and forecasts of rising          incomes, the overall outlook for housing remained favorable.        Business fixed investment remained a significant question mark in the          outlook for economic expansion. Recent readings on business spending for          equipment and software pointed to gradual improvement, but nonresidential          construction activity continued to be severely depressed in many areas.          It was unclear whether the recent strength in orders and shipments signaled          a significant acceleration in capital outlays, and in this regard the          new information that would become available in the next few weeks might          provide important evidence on the outlook for capital spending and thus          for the performance of the economy more generally. At least for now, however,          anecdotal reports suggested that a high degree of caution continued to          characterize business investment decisions in the face of an elevated          level of uncertainty. Much of the current spending for equipment and software          reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the          short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to          be little spending that would entail capital deepening. At the same time,          several positive factors in the outlook for capital spending could be          cited including the greater productivity of new capital equipment, the          temporary accelerated expensing tax incentives, generally strong business          cash positions, and the relatively rapid depreciation of existing capital          equipment. For the present, however, business contacts widely reported          that because of prevailing uncertainties they were deferring major investment          initiatives until they saw clear evidence of an increased need for capital          to meet growing demand.        Business firms appeared to be in the process of moving from inventory          liquidation to accumulation, and the available evidence suggested that          inventory positions were getting tighter. Accordingly, prospective growth          in final demand would have to be met through increased production. And          as demand rose over the next several quarters, businesses were expected          to accumulate inventories to maintain desired inventory-sales ratios,          adding in the process some limited impetus to the growth of GDP.        The growth of economic activity in most major foreign countries appeared          to be falling below expectations earlier in the year, with adverse implications          for U.S. exports. Among those nations, only Canada had experienced a robust          economic recovery thus far this year. Current forecasts continued to anticipate          strengthening activity abroad, but as in the case of the U.S. economy          substantial uncertainties surrounded the timing and pace of the improvement.        In the context of limited demand pressures on labor and other resources,          current forecasts continued to point to quite low and perhaps declining          inflation over the next several quarters, although there appeared to be          significant crosscurrents in the outlook for prices. Rapid increases in          healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large          increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.          Tending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use          of an extended period of economic activity below the economy’s potential          as well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently          declining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing          power in highly competitive markets. Indeed, the members did not rule          out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation. In this regard, some          observed that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could          imply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms. In addition,          further sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate          near zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy          through conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy          that called for negative real policy interest rates.        In the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period          ahead, all but two of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged          policy stance. In the view of all the members, current forecasts clearly          were subject to the risk that economic growth would not be sufficient          to reduce excess capacity in labor and capital markets. However, the members          who favored a steady policy course noted that the recent data on household          and business spending had been a bit stronger than expected and that a          number of factors pointed to solid growth over time. In these circumstances,          they believed that in the context of prevailing uncertainties more evidence          of subpar expansion was desirable before policy was eased further. It          was noted in this regard that the information that would become available          over the next several weeks should provide an improved basis for assessing          the recent anecdotal reports from around the nation that pointed to a          possibly slowing expansion. Several members indicated that if compelling          evidence of a weak economy were to materialize they would be prepared          to ease promptly. Two members preferred an immediate easing action because          they were persuaded by what they viewed as already strong evidence of          a persisting unsatisfactory, and perhaps weakening, economic performance.          While the current stance of policy was already accommodative, they felt          that greater stimulus was now called for to foster an acceptable pace          of economic expansion.        All the members agreed that the risks to the economy remained tilted          toward weakness and that such an assessment needed to be incorporated          in the statement to be released shortly after today’s meeting. The          members also accepted a proposal to add a reference in the statement regarding          what they viewed as recently heightened geopolitical risks that appeared          to constitute a major source of the uncertainty currently prevailing in          the economy. The addition was not intended to signal that any particular          policy response would be forthcoming in the event of a crisis. Rather,          consistent with its usual practice, the Committee would assess the implications          of any such development for the domestic economy before deciding on an          action. Indeed, if the geopolitical uncertainties were to ease significantly          along with what already were apparently diminishing concerns about corporate          governance issues, the resulting improvement in business and consumer          sentiment could generate a more robust economic expansion.         At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize          and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed          otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance          with the following domestic policy directive.                      The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions            that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.            To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future            seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the            federal funds rate at an average of around 1-3/4 percent.   The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in          the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:  Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable            economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee            believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions            that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough,            Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Jordan, Kohn, Olson, Santomero,            and Stern.   Votes against this action: Messrs. Gramlich and McTeer.  Messrs. Gramlich and McTeer dissented because they preferred to ease          monetary policy at this meeting. The economic expansion, which resumed          almost a year ago, had recently lost momentum, and job growth had been          minimal over the past year. With inflation already low and likely to decline          further in the face of economic slack and rapid productivity growth, the          potential cost of additional stimulus seemed low compared with the risk          of further weakness.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on          Wednesday, November 6, 2002.   The meeting
