34,"Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.",LABEL_0,0.9956400394439697
