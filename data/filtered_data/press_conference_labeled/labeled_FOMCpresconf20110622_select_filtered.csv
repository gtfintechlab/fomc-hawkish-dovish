50,"Another would be the fact that energy prices have passed through to a number of—despite the fact that core is defined excluding energy, that’s only the energy, direct energy products—things like airfares, for example, which are very sensitive to the cost of jet fuel, are also a part of the core.",LABEL_1,0.9117521047592163

53,"I think the—I think the thrust of “extended period” is that we believe we’re at least two or three meetings away from taking any further action, and I emphasize “at least.” But depending on how the economy evolves, and inflation and unemployment, it could be, you know, significantly longer.",LABEL_2,0.9179619550704956
