52,"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices.",LABEL_1,0.9988583326339722
53,"Moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9997832179069519

56,"Despite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation and prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher inflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect.",LABEL_2,0.9998250603675842

58,"Some members mentioned a number of favorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to attenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a result of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions in markets for energy.",LABEL_0,0.8997570872306824
59,Relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures.,LABEL_1,0.9740890264511108

62,The slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace near the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening price pressures and provided the Committee with a desirable opportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the course of economic activity and inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9990381002426147
63,"Indeed, to the extent that inflation expectations had declined recently, short-term interest rates, which had changed little in nominal terms, had edged higher in real terms, implying slightly greater monetary restraint and reducing the odds that inflation would pick up.",LABEL_2,0.9955600500106812
64,"Several viewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that the risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising inflation over time.",LABEL_0,0.9316526651382446
65,Other members commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be viewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary pressures.,LABEL_1,0.9691340327262878
