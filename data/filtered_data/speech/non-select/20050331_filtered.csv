0,HMDA Price Data Disclosure The importance of effective risk management is brought into sharp focus by the imminent public release of home mortgage price data by lenders such as your organizations.
1,"Lenders covered by HMDA will have to make additional information about their home loans, including, for the first time, price information, available to the public as early as today."
2,I recognize that many of you are concerned about the potential legal and reputational risks that accompany the disclosure of price data.
3,"Over the next few minutes, I want to put those risks in context by reviewing with you why the Federal Reserve decided in 2002 to require disclosure of price data on higher-priced loans and how lenders, government agencies, and the broader public should think about and use the data."
4,The requirement to disclose price data grew out of the objectives that motivated Congress' initial adoption of HMDA.
5,"These developments have made it feasible for institutions to lend to higher-risk borrowers, albeit at prices commensurate with the higher risk."
6,Many borrowers receiving higher-priced loans would in the past have been denied credit.
7,"The growth of lending to higher-risk borrowers, known as subprime borrowers, is generally a positive development."
8,"However, the growth of the subprime market has also raised public policy concerns."
9,Among the concerns are whether consumers who obtain higher-priced loans are sufficiently informed about their options to make the market work as efficiently as it could and to protect themselves from unfair or deceptive lending practices.
10,"In addition, the wider range of prices available in the marketplace has raised concerns about whether price variations reflect, even in part, unlawful discrimination rather than legitimate risk- and cost-related factors."
11,"For the first time, the regulation requires lenders to publicly disclose information about the prices of some of the home mortgage loans they originate."
12,"The requirement to disclose price data is limited to higher-priced loans, where concerns about market efficiency and consumer protection that I just described are greatest, and excludes the vast majority of prime loans, where limited variation in prices helps to allay such concerns."
13,"Price disclosure, while understandably a source of anxiety for some lenders, provides an opportunity to advance market efficiency and compliance with consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws."
14,"The price data, in combination with other data disclosed under HMDA, can be used as a screen that identifies aspects of the higher-priced end of the mortgage market that warrant a closer look."
15,"For example, the price data can be used by lenders, government agencies, and the public to identify institutions, product types, applicant types, and geographic markets where price differences among racial or other groups are sufficiently large to warrant further investigation."
16,"The price data might be used by lenders to identify markets with relatively large numbers of higher-priced loans, where entry may bring opportunities to lenders and increase options available to consumers."
17,"To realize the potential benefits of the price data, we must acknowledge and take into account the data's inherent limitations, which reflect in part concerns about the substantial costs of mandatory data reporting, which policymakers must weigh against public policy benefits."
18,"One of the most important limitations of the HMDA data set is that it does not include data about many of the legitimate factors lenders use to determine prices in the mortgage market, including key credit-risk factors."
19,"Thus, price disparities by race or ethnicity, if revealed in the HMDA data, will not alone prove unlawful discrimination."
20,"For example, the unwarranted tarnishing of a lender's reputation could reduce the willingness of that lender or another to remain in, or enter, certain higher-priced segments of the market."
21,The Federal Reserve recognizes both the opportunities and risks the new price data will bring.
22,"An institution that might soon--as early as today--have to disclose its own price data, should already have analyzed its data and be prepared to respond to comments from others interpreting its data."
23,"A lender may also want to determine if the HMDA data reflect price disparities that are not adequately explained by other information in the HMDA data set--such as income, loan size, and lien status--and, if so, to analyze those disparities in light of price variables known to the lender."
24,"Accordingly, we are available to discuss your implementation efforts at any time and we desire to hear specifics about which elements of the proposal, from your perspective, will demand the greatest investments or appear to generate the greatest uncertainty."
