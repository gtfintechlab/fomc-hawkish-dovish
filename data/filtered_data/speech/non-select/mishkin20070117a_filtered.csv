2,"January 17, 2007 Enterprise Risk Management and Mortgage Lending Governor Frederic S. Mishkin At the Forecasterâ€™s Club of New York, New York, New York Share Over the past ten years, we have seen extraordinary run-ups in house prices."
3,"From 1996 to the present, nominal house prices in the United States have doubled, rising at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate.1 Over the past five years, the rise even accelerated to an annual average increase of 8-3/4 percent."
4,"For example, Australia, Denmark, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have had even higher rates of house price appreciation in recent years."
5,"Although increases in house price have recently moderated in some countries, they still are very high relative to rents."
6,"Furthermore, with the exception of Germany and Japan, the ratios of house prices to disposable income in many countries are greater than what would have been predicted on the basis of their trends."
7,"Because prices of homes, like other asset prices, are inherently forward looking, it is extremely hard to say whether they are above their fundamental value."
8,"Nevertheless, when asset prices increase explosively, concern always arises that a bubble may be developing and that its bursting might lead to a sharp fall in prices that could severely damage the economy."
9,This concern has led to an active debate among monetary policy makers around the world on the appropriate reaction to the run-ups in house prices that we have recently seen in many markets: Should central banks raise interest rates?
10,And how should they prepare themselves to react if housing prices decline?
11,"Home prices, like other asset prices, have important effects on output and inflation."
12,Home prices affect the economy in two primary ways.
13,"That expectation boosts demand for homes, which stimulates new construction and aggregate demand."
14,"Of course, the sustained rise in prices can simultaneously sow the seeds of a market correction by making houses progressively less affordable relative to income, thereby limiting the demand for them and restraining additional construction."
15,"Second, higher home prices increase household wealth, thus stimulating consumer spending, another component of aggregate demand."
16,"Because central banks are in the business of managing total demand in the economy so as to produce desirable outcomes on inflation and employment, monetary policy should accordingly respond to home prices to the extent that these prices are influencing aggregate demand and resource utilization."
17,The issue of how central banks should respond to house price movements is therefore not whether they should respond at all.
18,"Rather, the issue is whether they should respond over and above the response called for in terms of objectives to stabilize inflation and employment over the usual policy time horizon."
19,"The issue here is the same one that applies to how central banks should respond to potential bubbles in asset prices in general: Because subsequent collapses of these asset prices might be highly damaging to the economy, as they were in Japan in the 1990s, should the monetary authority try to prick, or at least slow the growth of, developing bubbles?"
20,I will outline some conventional arguments for and against reacting to asset prices over and above their direct and foreseeable effects on inflation and employment.
21,I will also discuss some additional reasons why central banks should not overly emphasize house prices in particular.
22,"Although I come down squarely on the side of those who oppose giving a special role to house prices in the conduct of monetary policy, I do think that central banks can take steps to ensure that sharp movements in the prices of homes or other assets do not have serious negative consequences for the economy."
23,There is no question that asset price bubbles have potential negative effects on the economy.
24,The departure of asset prices from fundamentals can lead to inappropriate investments that decrease the efficiency of the economy.
25,"For example, if home prices rise above what the fundamentals would justify, too many houses will be built."
26,"Moreover, at some point, bubbles burst and asset prices then return to their fundamental values."
27,"When this happens, the sharp downward correction of asset prices can lead to a sharp contraction in the economy, both directly, through effects on investment, and indirectly, through the effects of reduced household wealth on consumer spending."
28,"Despite the clear dangers from asset price bubbles, the question remains as to whether central banks should do anything about them."
29,"Some economists have argued that central banks should at times ""lean against the wind"" by raising interest rates to stop bubbles from getting out of hand."
30,"They argue that if a bubble has been identified, then raising interest rates will produce better outcomes."
31,"For instance, William White, of the Bank for International Settlements, has said that ""monetary policy might rather be used in a highly discretionary way to respond to growing imbalances that were judged by policymakers to threaten financial instability."
32,"""2 Although central banks have generally not argued that interest rates should be raised aggressively to burst asset price bubbles, statements suggest some central bankers believe some leaning against the wind might be warranted."
33,"For example, in the second half of 2003 and the first half of 2004, a minority of members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England argued for raising interest rates more than could be justified in terms of the Bank of England's objectives for inflation over its normal policy horizon."
34,They said that such a move would help lower the probability of house prices rising further and make it less likely that a house price collapse would occur later.
35,"Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, did not advocate leaning against the wind but did suggest that, to prevent a buildup of financial imbalances, a central bank might extend the horizon over which inflation is brought back to target."
36,Statements from officials at the European Central Bank also have suggested that the possibility of an asset boom or bust might require longer than the usual one to two years in assessing whether the price stability goal was being met.
37,I studied the Riksbank in a report on monetary policy written with Francesco Giavazzi for the Swedish parliament before I came to the Federal Reserve Board.3 We found that communications by the Riksbank suggested to market participants that it was actually adjusting monetary policy to lean against the wind of rapid increases in home prices.
38,This monetary policy action was accompanied by a statement acknowledging that the inflation forecast was revised downward.
39,In fact the Inflation Report published on the same day also showed that inflation forecasts had been revised downward and were below the 2 percent target at every horizon.
40,"The Executive Board's statement pointed out that ""there is also reason to observe that household indebtedness and house prices are continuing to rise rapidly."
41,"Not surprisingly, market participants took this statement to mean that the Riksbank was setting the policy instrument not only to control inflation but also to restrain house prices."
42,"A similar reference to house prices in explaining the decision to raise rates was made in the press release of January 20, 2006."
43,"The above statements suggest that some central bankers advocate that asset prices, and in particular, house prices, should have a special role in the conduct of monetary policy over and above their foreseeable effect on inflation and employment."
44,A special role for asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy requires three key assumptions.
45,"A second assumption needed to justify a special role for asset prices is that monetary policy cannot appropriately deal with the consequences of a burst bubble, and so preemptive actions against a bubble are needed."
46,"Asset price crashes can sometimes lead to severe episodes of financial instability, with the most recent notable example among industrial countries being that of Japan."
47,"In principal, in the event of such a crash, monetary policy might become less effective in restoring the economy's health."
48,"To begin with, the bursting of asset price bubbles often does not lead to financial instability."
49,There are even stronger reasons to believe that a bursting of a bubble in house prices is unlikely to produce financial instability.
50,"House prices are far less volatile than stock prices, outright declines after a run-up are not the norm, and declines that do occur are typically relatively small."
51,"Hence, declines in home prices are far less likely to cause losses to financial institutions, default rates on residential mortgages typically are low, and recovery rates on foreclosures are high."
52,"Not surprisingly, declines in home prices generally have not led to financial instability."
53,"The financial instability that many countries experienced in the 1990s, including Japan, was caused by bad loans that resulted from declines in commercial property prices and not declines in home prices."
54,"In the absence of financial instability, monetary policy should be effective in countering the effects of a burst bubble."
55,"In addition, with the benefit of hindsight, it seems clear that the Bank of Japan did not ease monetary policy sufficiently or rapidly enough in the aftermath of the crisis."
56,"Deflation in Japan might never have set in had the Bank of Japan responded more rapidly after the asset price crash, which was substantially weakening demand in the economy."
57,A third assumption needed to justify a special focus on asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy is that a central bank actually knows the appropriate monetary policy to deflate a bubble.
58,The effect of interest rates on asset price bubbles is highly uncertain.
59,"Although some theoretical models suggest that raising interest rates can diminish the acceleration of asset prices, others suggest that raising interest rates may cause a bubble to burst more severely, thus doing even more damage to the economy."
60,An illustration of the difficulty of knowing the appropriate response to a possible bubble was provided when the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy before the October 1929 stock market crash because of its concerns about a possible stock market bubble.
61,"With hindsight, economists have viewed this monetary policy tightening as a mistake."
62,"Given the uncertainty about the effect of interest rates on bubbles, raising rates to deflate a bubble may do more harm than good."
63,"Furthermore, altering the trajectory of interest rates from the path predicted to have the most desirable outcomes for inflation and employment over the foreseeable horizon has the obvious cost of producing deviations from these desirable outcomes."
64,"Because I doubt that any of the three assumptions needed to justify a special monetary policy focus on asset prices holds up, I am in the camp of those who argue that monetary policy makers should restrict their efforts to achieving their dual mandate of stabilizing inflation and employment and should not alter policy to have preemptive effects on asset prices."
65,"However, there is a further reason why I believe that a central bank should not put too much focus on asset prices."
66,"Such a focus can weaken its public support, making it harder for it to successfully conduct monetary policy to stabilize inflation and employment."
67,A central bank that focuses intently on asset prices looks as if it is trying to control too many elements of the economy.
68,"Specifically, central banks have argued that they are less capable of controlling real economic trends in the long run and should therefore focus more on price stability and damping short-term economic fluctuations."
69,A central bank that expanded its focus to asset prices could potentially weaken its public support and may even cause the public to worry that it is too powerful and has undue influence over all aspects of the economy.
70,Too much focus on asset prices might also weaken support for a central bank by leading to public confusion about its objectives.
71,"When my co-author and I conducted our evaluation of monetary policy in Sweden, I directly observed this problem."
72,I heard over and over again in interviews with participants from different sectors of Swedish society that the statements about house prices by the Riksbank confused the public about what it was trying to achieve.
73,My discussion so far indicates that central banks should not put a special emphasis on prices of houses or other assets in the conduct of monetary policy.
74,This does not mean that central banks should stand by idly when such prices climb steeply.
75,Rather my analysis suggests that central banks can take steps to make it less likely that sharp movements in asset prices will have serious negative consequences for the economy.
76,Instead of trying to preemptively deal with the bubble--which I have argued is almost impossible to do--a central bank can minimize financial instability by being ready to react quickly to an asset price collapse if it occurs.
77,One way a central bank can prepare itself to react quickly is to explore different scenarios to assess how it should respond to an asset price collapse.
78,"By conducting similar exercises, in this case for monetary policy, a central bank can minimize the damage from a collapse of an asset price bubble without having to judge that a bubble is in progress or predict that it will burst in the near future."
79,"If elevated asset prices might be leading to excessive risk-taking on the part of financial institutions, the central bank, as in the case of the United States, can ask financial institutions if they have the appropriate practices to ensure that they are not taking on too much risk."
80,Working through supervisory channels has the advantage not only of helping make financial institutions better able to cope with possible asset price declines but possibly also of indirectly restraining extreme asset prices if they have been stimulated by excessive bank financing.
81,"Also, reminding institutions to maintain risk-management practices appropriate to the economic and financial environment could potentially help lessen a buildup of excessive asset prices in the first place."
82,"In these reports, central banks can evaluate whether rises in asset prices might be leading to excessive risk-taking on the part of financial institutions or whether distortions from inappropriate tax or regulatory policy may be stimulating excessive valuations of assets."
