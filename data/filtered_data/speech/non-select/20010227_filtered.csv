1,The predominant risk remains that growth will be notably slower than would be consistent with the economy realizing its full potential over time.
2,"One factor pointing to a risk of unacceptably slow growth is the uncertainty about consumer sentiment, which has been a feature of the recent period."
3,"Usually, consumer sentiment closely mirrors contemporaneous economic conditions, and it generally moves closely with the growth in household spending."
4,"Not surprisingly, the key influences on household spending, such as the growth of personal incomes and the buoyancy of financial markets, also appear to bear importantly on consumer sentiment."
5,Another recent development has been some adverse movement in inflation rates.
6,Recent inflation changes have been influenced importantly by increases in energy prices.
7,"Prices of petroleum-related products increased notably through the first half of last year, followed more recently by sharp increases in prices of natural gas and, in some regions, electricity."
8,"Largely reflecting these developments, consumer price inflation has accelerated appreciably over the past year to 3-3/4 percent over the twelve months ended in January."
9,"The Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy has accelerated as well over the past year, but much more modestly than the overall index, to a rate of increase slightly above 2-1/2 percent."

17,Monetary Policy One of our more important policy concerns in designing the study was the potential effect of financial consolidation on the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.
18,"The study finds, however, that financial consolidation has not significantly affected the ability of central banks to achieve the objectives of monetary policy."
19,"As part of our research, we asked central banks in all the study nations about their experiences with consolidation and monetary policy."
20,"A key reason for this finding is that even with the substantial consolidation we have observed, the financial markets important for monetary policy have generally remained highly competitive."
21,"Consolidation could, at least in theory, affect the way changes in monetary policy are transmitted to the real economy."
22,"For example, consolidation could potentially alter the way banks adjust the availability and pricing of credit to their customers as the central bank changes the stance of monetary policy."
23,"On balance, and despite these quite positive results, our study recommends that central banks should remain alert to the implications of any future reductions in the competitiveness of the markets most important for monetary policy implementation."
24,"Similarly, we suggest that central banks ought to monitor potential future effects on the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy."
25,Monetary policy is simply too important to the health of all our economies to do otherwise.
