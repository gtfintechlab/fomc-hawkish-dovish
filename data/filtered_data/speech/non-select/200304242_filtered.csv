0,"Although the U.S. economy has managed modest real growth through 2002 and into 2003, most economists agree that a strong and well-balanced recovery will require a greater contribution from the business sector, in the form of increased capital investment and hiring."
1,The staff converts these nominal spending figures into real terms using producer price indexes or other appropriate deflators.
2,"But monetary policymaking requires projections for longer horizons, up to six to eight quarters ahead."
3,"According to the neoclassical model, which is based on an analysis of the marginal costs and benefits to a firm of acquiring additional capital goods, investment spending by firms depends primarily on two factors: first, the projected growth in business output, as determined by final demand, and, second, the cost of acquiring and using capital goods, the so-called user cost of capital."
4,Higher projected output growth naturally leads firms to expand their capacity to produce by investing in new capital goods.
5,"This relationship between the rate of growth of demand and the level of investment spending, dubbed the accelerator effect, is a venerable and empirically well-supported relationship in economics."
6,"The fact that investment spending itself is part of final demand, however, leads to a certain circularity in the analysis: If firms decide to invest aggressively, then final demand will be high, justifying the rapid pace of investment; but likewise, weak investment demand can be partly self-justifying (Kiyotaki, 1988)."
7,"The user cost of capital depends in turn on such factors as the prices of new capital goods, the real interest rate at which firms must borrow to finance their investment spending, the rate at which capital depreciates, and the degree to which the tax code subsidizes or penalizes investment."
8,"Not surprisingly, increases in the user cost of capital have been found to reduce business investment, although the size of the effect is less well identified statistically and more controversial among economists than the effect of output growth mentioned previously."
9,"When firm managers are highly optimistic about the potential of a new technology, a new product, or a new market, for example, they are likely to invest aggressively, almost independently of the level of interest rates and similar ""fundamentals."""
10,"Monetary policy decisions are made by twelve of the nineteen members of the Federal Open Market Committee: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven Reserve Bank presidents, among whom the vote rotates annually."
11,Growth in real investment averaged close to 10 percent per year between 1995 and early 2000.
12,"The rapid pace of business investment in the nineties was central to the unusually high rates of economic growth, low rates of unemployment, and rapid productivity growth that we observed during that period."
13,"Final demand and hence output grew strongly, and the user cost of capital was falling."
14,Tevlin and Whelan showed that these two factors--low and falling prices of computing power and high economic depreciation rates--can explain much of the high rates of gross investment in computers during the nineties; and that these high rates of investment in computers in turn help to explain a substantial part of the overall investment boom.
15,"Outside the legislative arena, rapidly increasing access to the Internet raised the possibility of a huge new on-line demand for products and services, which spurred a wave of new dot-com startup companies hoping to be the first to meet that anticipated demand."
16,"Established firms, from booksellers to clothing retailers, responded with their own on-line marketing outlets, which further boosted the demand for servers, software, and other components."
17,"In any event, given this optimism and the attendant rise in earnings forecasts and the stock market, together with good fundamentals in terms of high demand, falling equipment prices, and moderate financing costs, the late-nineties boom in investment is perhaps not so difficult to understand."
18,"Among the factors contributing to the rising user cost was a much less rapid decline in the relative price of computing power, perhaps reflecting a slowdown in the pace of technological advance, and a policy tightening by the Fed (in part, an unwinding of the easing that took place during the Russian debt crisis)."
19,"Some weakening also occurred in the demand for business output, including most notably a mild deceleration of personal consumption expenditures early in 2000."
20,"The strength of the dollar hurt demand as well, particularly in the manufacturing sector."
21,"Though the evidence is strong that high-tech investments have greatly enhanced productivity in the economy, by 2000 many managers had apparently become concerned that the long-term profit potential of their investments in computers and communications equipment was smaller than they had expected."
22,"In some cases the difficulties were technological, sometimes (as in the case of on-line retailing) the expected level of consumer demand did not materialize, sometimes the business plans were faulty, sometimes economic or regulatory conditions were not as had been expected, and sometimes the productivity enhancements were less than anticipated."
23,This shift in expectations can be seen clearly in the downward revisions to analysts' long-term earnings expectations (which mirrored declines in equity prices) beginning in the second half of 2000.
24,"Analysts' forecasts of long-term earnings growth for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies index declined from about 15 percent per year at their peak in 2000 to less than 12 percent recently (still a historically high level, however)."
25,Continued growth in the high-tech equipment sector will be important in any investment recovery.
26,"The manufacturing sector accounts for only about 20 percent of aggregate investment, and trend growth in manufacturing investment, moreover, is well below that of aggregate investment; hence, low capacity utilization in manufacturing is not inconsistent with reasonably robust rates of aggregate investment."
27,"Low capacity utilization rates in those sectors primarily reflect not an earlier period of over-investment but rather weak current demand for manufacturing output, the product of a variety of cyclical and secular factors, including a strong dollar and weak conditions abroad."
28,"Final demand is already taken into account, for example, in the standard neoclassical model of investment, through projections of business output."
29,"First, one should consider the ""fundamental"" determinants of investment, the macroeconomic factors that determine the user cost of capital and the demand for business output."
30,"Second, one can take a more disaggregated approach and look at various sectors and types of capital to assess their potential for growth."
31,"Putting these pieces together, though no late-nineties type of boom seems likely, most factors point to a moderate pickup in business investment and economic growth in the second half of 2003 and in 2004."
32,"The user cost of capital is low and, dominated by continuing reductions in the quality-adjusted prices of high-tech equipment and historically low interest rates, will likely continue to decline."
33,"The partial expensing provision passed by the Congress in 2001 provides a significant incentive for firms to purchase equipment and certain types of software before the provision expires in the third quarter of 2004.3 Under the general heading of financing conditions, favorable factors include the good financial condition of the banking system, improvements in corporate liquidity, and the substantial narrowing of risk spreads in corporate bond markets (though these remain somewhat elevated by historical standards).4 Potentially favorable, or at least improving, conditions prevail on the output or final demand side of the equation as well."
34,"Although many forecasters have marked down their estimates of GDP growth for the full year 2003, most still expect a pickup in the second half of the year and further acceleration in 2004."
35,"High productivity, lower oil prices, reduced geopolitical uncertainty, the waning effects of the stock market decline, and stimulative monetary and fiscal policies should all support spending, providing reasonable growth in final demand."
36,"However, a negative factor is weak growth abroad."
37,"Residential investment was an important engine of growth in 2002, and most forecasters (as evidenced by the Blue Chip survey, for example) expect that it will continue strong in 2003."
38,"Inventory investment, by contrast, is generally expected to contribute little in 2003, in contrast to 2002, when this component made a significant net contribution to GDP growth."
39,"The risk here is clearly both downside and upside: On the downside, conceivably housing demand may weaken, but on the upside, firms may increase their inventories more than expected if they grow more optimistic about future sales."
40,"I have noted some grounds for modest optimism, as the high-tech sector already showed growth in 2002."
41,"Moderately improved performance for 2003 in high-tech investment, concentrated in a pickup in the second half of the year, seems feasible and consistent with fundamentals, particularly the continued decline in relative prices and growing replacement demand."
42,"Finally, some growth later in the year in non-high-tech equipment, excluding perhaps the relatively small aircraft component, is plausible and consistent with a scenario of strengthening overall investment."
