0,"Even though employment is high and inflation is low, the growth of real incomes for American workers has been virtually non-existent."
1,"Even during the much maligned 1980s, growth in real compensation per hour in the business sector averaged 1/2 of 1 percent per year--a far cry from no change in four years."
2,"When it comes to economic growth, small changes mean a lot."
3,"For example, that extra 1/2 of 1 percent growth per year in real incomes is the equivalent of roughly $300,000 worth of added consumption over the lifetime of an average American born this year, or $4,000 per year."
4,"So, if we want to pay to send every American to college, cover rising health care costs, pay off the national debt, raise the homeownership rate to a new high, send a man to Mars, and have enough left over for a fairly nice vacation every other year, let's find a way of raising the growth rate by half a percent per year."
5,The truth of the matter is that there is no magic formula in the growth business.
6,"But, in both the technical and the vernacular discussion of economic growth, simply employing more people at a flat level of compensation is not considered a successful growth strategy for an economy."
7,We have made enormous strides in increasing productivity in our manufacturing sector and have the data to prove it.
8,"Manufacturing output is up 24 percent since the business-cycle trough in 1991, but manufacturing employment is actually lower today than it was that year."
9,We can all appreciate that this manufacturing productivity success story was accompanied by a good deal of individual pain and sacrifice.
10,Complicating this entire discussion is the fact that the public policy debate on faster growth is taking place in the midst of the political process.
11,"This year we have frequently heard from various quarters that it is a shortage of money, or its analog--interest rates are too high--which is preventing the American economy from growing faster."
12,The supposed remedy usually involves some degree of making monetary policy decisionmaking more responsive to the political process.
13,"Gibbon found evidence of politically motivated inflation in late Republican Rome, for example."
14,"If there were any empirical evidence, let alone any logic, to the case that simply printing money leads to sustained higher economic growth for any period, I would be the first to advocate that we buy every printing press on the planet and start chopping down trees."
15,"Frankly, as a recipe for sustained growth, money creation simply does not pass the test."
16,"Rather, is monetary policy in any fundamental sense currently restraining real growth?"
17,"But, I do not mean to imply that monetary policy is irrelevant to economic growth."
18,"While monetary policy cannot influence the amount of labor or capital available to an economy in any sustainable way, it probably can help augment growth by improving the way in which resources are used."
19,"I believe that the best pro-growth prescription is to run monetary policy in a stable, predictable fashion which involves little or no inflation."
20,"Second, a stable non-inflationary environment is most likely to lead investors to minimize the time and effort they spend on socially nonproductive hedging strategies designed to protect wealth in the event of a dramatic change in policy."
21,"Third, a low-inflation environment is likely to minimize the level of, and attendant distortions from, taxation, certainly redirecting capital to better uses, and probably increasing the willingness to save, as well."
22,"While these effects are probably difficult to quantify, they are more certain to bear fruit than either a simple policy of rapid money creation or even a more politically sensitive monetary policy."
23,"In the last twenty-five years, we have learned, somewhat painfully, that economies are subject to shocks over which they have little control and that such shocks are disruptive to long-term planning and growth."
24,"Having denied the efficacy of an often cited recipe for faster economic growth, I do have some positive suggestions for those who want to adopt policies to make America grow faster."
25,"To this end, the focus of public policy should turn from directing the private sector on how to increase its productivity toward asking the public sector to make better use of the resources under its control."
26,"By contrast, employment in the public sector is up 6.2 percent over the same period."
27,"By contrast, politicians should be able to redirect public-sector resources more directly and efficiently, resulting in potential increases to the national growth rate."
28,"As I mentioned at the outset, growth is not a free lunch."
29,Even productivity improvements and efficiency moves have their costs.
30,"I suggest three low-cost growth lunches for consideration, which I will call the three Es: education, entitlements, and efficiency criteria."
31,The failure of American education in recent years is now constraining economic growth because of a lack of basic skills.
32,"During the 1980s, for example, after adjusting for inflation, per pupil expenditures on public schools rose 39 percent, from $4,762 to $6,610 per year."
33,The public understands intuitively that the low productivity of our public education system is caused by the way educational resources are utilized.
34,The disastrous effect that the public education monopoly is having on economic growth is two-fold.
35,"In a world where a mind is a terrible thing to waste, we are slowing the long-term rate of economic growth by causing a permanent underutilization of our nation's potential labor force."
36,"One can tell this because the price mechanism, which directs the private market to produce only those goods which consumers value more than the cost of production, is not allowed to work."
37,The cost of public schools is covered by taxes and the price of public school education is set at zero for consumers.
38,"Those that can afford the house prices in suburban jurisdictions and are willing to pay still more in an extended commute back to the city to work, do so."
39,It is time to bring competition and choice to this vital American industry and enjoy the resulting gains in economic efficiency and growth.
40,"Entitlements Just as our public-sector education system is a major drag on labor's contribution to economic growth, our public-sector retirement and health care schemes are a major impediment to capital formation."
41,"If that is not bad enough, those extra dollars coming in have all been applied to reducing the federal budget deficit on which so much attention is focused, further obscuring any long-term problem."
42,The effect on growth and saving results because people act on the belief that they will actually receive the $5 trillion in excess promises to which the government has committed.
43,"As with education, we are paying a social price well beyond the mere economic costs."
44,"Efficiency Criteria Having discussed ways of improving both the supply of labor and the supply of capital to our economy and thus produce greater growth, let me turn to the third aspect of the growth equation: using existing resources more wisely."
45,"Again, I would like to take some lessons from the private sector, where we have witnessed productivity gains, and apply them to the public sector."
46,Let me stress that this emphasis is quite different from the current focus on the fiscal deficit for determining the success of policy.
47,"True, the deficit was lower."
48,"Now, if the government were to invest those resources in projects which yielded a 15 percent rate of return, the economy would clearly be better off, and the rate of economic growth would accelerate."
49,"If the dollars were not wisely used--say, put in a project yielding 3 percent--the economy would be worse off and economic growth would slow."
50,"Conclusion In sum, I do believe that the American economy can grow quicker and that the American people are right in demanding that it do so."
51,We have been blessed in America with a competitive market mechanism that encourages private-sector decisionmakers to greatly enhance the productivity of their operations.
