0,So this conference seems an appropriate place in which to reflect once more on the prodigious growth of these risk-transfer instruments and their implications for financial stability.
1,"At the same time, I indicated some concerns about the risks associated with derivatives, including the risks posed by concentration in certain derivatives markets, notably the over-the-counter (OTC) markets for U.S. dollar interest rate options."
2,Derivatives: Potential Benefits and Risk-Management Challenges Perhaps the clearest evidence of the perceived benefits that derivatives have provided is their continued spectacular growth.
3,"As a consequence of the increasing demand for these products, the size of the global OTC derivatives markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), reached a notional principal value of $220 trillion in June 2004."
4,"Indeed, the growth rate of the OTC markets was more rapid in 2001-04 than over the previous three years."
5,"At the same time, the growth rate of exchange-traded derivatives exceeded the growth rate of OTC derivatives over 2001-04."
6,"Throughout the 1990s, the Chicago futures and options exchanges debated whether the growth of the OTC markets was good or bad for their markets."
7,"Concentration in Derivatives Markets: The Case of U.S. Dollar Interest Rate Options Financial consolidation has reduced the number of firms that, by acting as dealers, provide liquidity to the OTC derivatives markets."
8,Among the markets identified as appearing to be especially concentrated were the markets for U.S. dollar interest rate options.
9,"The dealers intermediate between these mortgage hedgers, who seek to purchase swaptions and interest rate caps, and sellers of various types of interest rate options."
10,The options sellers include issuers of traditional callable debt and issuers of structured notes with interest rate caps or other embedded options.
11,"Hedge funds at times have been important sellers of options and suppliers of options market liquidity, especially during periods when increases in interest rate volatility have caused spikes in options prices."
12,"Second, meeting the demands for options by mortgage hedgers involves market risk to dealers, a concern that has been heightened by the fact that the notional value of options sold by dealers significantly exceeds the notional value purchased."
13,Their periodic purchases of interest rate options are intended to limit their reliance on dynamic hedging and their potential demands on swaps market liquidity.
14,Articles that appeared in the financial press in early 2004 called attention to the fact that the BIS data showed that the notional value of U.S. dollar interest rate options sold by OTC derivatives dealers exceeded the notional value of options purchased.
15,The interviews that Federal Reserve staff members conducted last year indicate that dealers run fairly well-balanced books in terms of sensitivities to changes in interest rates and especially to changes in interest rate volatility.
16,The options that dealers sell tend to have terms that create less sensitivity to changes in interest rate volatility than the options that they buy.
17,"Thus, in order to limit the overall sensitivity of their options portfolios to changes in interest rate volatility, dealers must sell a larger notional value of options than they buy."
18,All the major participants in the markets for U.S. dollar interest rate options markets that Federal Reserve staff interviewed follow these practices.
19,"In such circumstances, when the nondefaulting counterparties seek to close out their positions with a defaulting counterparty, those actions can cause market prices to move rapidly in directions that may amplify losses to levels significantly exceeding even very conservative collateral requirements."
20,"Nonetheless, participants in the interest rate options markets and other derivatives markets should carefully evaluate the potential market effects of the failure of a dealer or any other large market participant and the ways in which such effects could magnify both their counterparty credit risks and their market risks."
21,"In summary, as we have come to understand more clearly how participants in the OTC interest rate options markets use those markets and manage the risks associated with their use, wariness about concentration in these markets, though diminished, has not disappeared."
22,"Moreover, this growth has been accompanied by significant product innovation, notably the development of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which allow the credit risk of a portfolio of underlying exposures to be divided or ""tranched"" into different segments, each with different risk and return characteristics."
23,Recent growth of credit derivatives has been concentrated in these more-complex structured products.
24,"If institutional money proves to be ""hot money,"" hedge funds could become subject to funding pressures that would impair their ability to supply liquidity to markets and might cause them to add to demands on market liquidity."
25,"In light of these reports and of the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry, the Federal Reserve recently reviewed banks' management of hedge fund credit risk in relation to the recommendations that supervisors and the CRMPG made in 1999."
26,"Third, and perhaps of greatest concern, in certain highly liquid markets, especially OTC interest rate swaps and repos, there are signs that competitive pressures may be eroding the protection that banks achieve through collateral requirements by reducing the initial margins that they obtain from hedge funds."
27,"At the same time, it would impair their capacity to pursue strategies that enhance the efficiency and liquidity of our financial markets and thereby to contribute to the productivity and resilience of our economy."
