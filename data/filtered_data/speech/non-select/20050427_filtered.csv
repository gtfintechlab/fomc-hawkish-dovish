0,"Tommaso has stated: ""In shaping monetary policy operations, the role of the financial environment is not less important than the charter."
1,"Those currencies were brought into line with one another, first through the exchange rate mechanism and later by the permanent fixing of exchange rates."
2,"Although the integration of U.S. financial markets was considerable by the time the Federal Reserve Act was passed, remaining segmentation made it possible to have different prices for Reserve Bank credit in different regions during the System's early years."
3,"In Tommaso's terms, monetary policy operations--that is, discount policy--reflected both the regional nature of the System's charter and the partial segmentation of the financial environment."
4,"From the perspective of monetary policy, it was at that point that the Federal Reserve System became a single central bank rather than a confederation of regional central banks."
5,"This difference in the relative power of the center, however, should not have great significance for the conduct of monetary policy."
6,"I would argue that these slight variations in the implementation of monetary policy reflect the financial circumstances under which each institution operates, with a unified money market in the United States and more-fragmented (but consolidating) money markets in the eurozone."
7,"Internal Dynamics Although the 1935 legislation that created the Federal Open Market Committee of today shifted monetary policy power from the regions to the center, important questions remained about the internal workings of the FOMC itself."
8,"My understanding is that the ECB's Governing Council operates by consensus, although a procedure is in place for a majority vote to determine the course of monetary policy."
9,Mandates and Approaches to Monetary Policy The original Federal Reserve Act contained almost no explicit macroeconomic goals for the System to follow.
10,"The gold standard was thought to be sufficient to produce price stability, and the central bank's lending to meet the needs of trade (""real bills"") was seen as fostering financial stability and the smooth functioning of the economy."
11,"Nonetheless, fairly early in its history, the Federal Reserve interpreted its mandate to be the promotion of monetary and credit conditions that would foster sustainable growth and a stable value of the dollar."
12,The Employment Act of 1946 committed the federal government to use its resources to foster maximum employment.
13,This act provided some broad guidance for the Federal Reserve but not explicit goals for monetary policy.
14,"These goals were stated in terms of maintaining long-run growth of monetary and credit aggregates that would promote ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
15,"Thus, the mandate really contained three goals, but the last one has been widely interpreted as those long-term interest rates consistent with the first two goals, giving the Federal Reserve a ""dual mandate"" of maximum employment and stable prices."
16,"Many times in recent decades, the Federal Reserve has stressed its long-run goal of stable prices, linking it with the other half of our mandate by noting that in the long run the two do not conflict."
17,"For the ECB, the Maastricht treaty mandated that price stability would be the primary objective."
18,"The treaty also established that the ECB should support the general economic policies of the European Community, aiming at growth and employment but only insofar as price stability is not endangered."
19,This focus on price stability helped establish credibility for the new central bank and has helped anchor inflation expectations among the public.
20,A case can be made that the primacy of the inflation goal also reflected the Bundesbank's distaste for inflation in light of the German hyperinflation of the 1920s and that this legacy was bequeathed to the new European Central Bank.
21,"The ECB has wisely interpreted its mandate as maintaining price stability ""over the medium term,"" giving it flexibility to deal with temporary shocks."
22,"Communication and Transparency As the conduct of monetary policy has changed over time, it has become increasingly important that the central bank communicate in an effective and transparent manner."
23,"As part of its communication efforts, the Federal Reserve, since the late 1970s, has been providing forecasts of inflation and real economic activity twice a year, as several other central banks have elected to do more recently."
24,"This past January, the semiannual FOMC forecasts reported in the Monetary Policy Report were extended to include the following calendar year."
25,"In particular, the ECB follows its monetary policy meetings with a news conference in which the president reads a statement reflecting the Council's deliberations and then answers questions."
26,"In December 2000, when the ECB started releasing twice-yearly forecasts of gross domestic product and inflation, it chose to release its staff forecasts, in contrast to the practice of the Federal Reserve, which releases the range and central tendencies of projections of the individual FOMC members."
27,"I would argue that the Federal Reserve's ongoing process of transparency may also reflect the highly developed state of our financial markets and a growing recognition that, against that financial backdrop, shaping the expectations of market participants can on occasion be an important adjunct to monetary policy."
28,"Monetary policy arrangements do, and should, adjust over time to changes in the economic and financial environment."
29,"While there is no single best way to arrange monetary policy and central bank functions within a multiregional system, I am struck by the broad similarities between the Federal Reserve and the Eurosystem as each grapples with a large, complex, and ever-changing macroeconomy."
