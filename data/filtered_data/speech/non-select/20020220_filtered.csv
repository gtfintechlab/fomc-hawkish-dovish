0,"In the past few years, both countries have experienced a significant wealth effect--so significant that understanding the wealth effect has become an important aspect of conducting monetary policy."
1,"Since 2000, equity prices have moderated, but the wealth-income ratio is still above 5."
2,"Here the wealth-income ratio has averaged about 4.75 for the past thirty years, and a moderate boom in housing prices and a huge boom in equity values in the late 1990s took the ratio to 6.5 by mid-2000."
3,"For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over 1983-99, the spending of U.S. households that owned stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks had no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. households in the top income quintile and households that had attained some college education showed larger consumption increases than other households, and also disproportionate increases in consumption compared to disposable income."
4,"Between early 1995 and early 2000, the Wilshire 5000 stock-price index (a broad measure of equity prices in the United States) tripled, and nearly $12 trillion was added to the wealth of the U.S. households."
5,The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the run-up in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth built into the Fed's model.
6,"The U.S. experience in the past few years has not provided an equivalent test of the effect of housing wealth on consumption, because movements in house prices have been more limited than the striking swings in equity prices."
7,"But the gain in house prices was fairly steady, making isolating its effect on household spending difficult."
8,"As in the United States, equity prices in the United Kingdom have fallen sharply since 2000."
9,"The saving rate appears not to have increased much over this period, in part because house prices have continued to rise at double-digit annual rates and in part because of lagged effects of past wealth increases."
10,"First, on the equity side, the value of equities can change for two reasons: because market participants adopt a new view of future profits or because market participants apply a different set of discount factors to those expected profits, where the discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premiums."
11,"Barry Bosworth, Robert Hall, and others have pointed out that, from a theoretical standpoint, stock-price movements should have different effects on household spending depending on whether they derive from changes in expected profits or from changes in discount rates."
12,"Suppose, for example, that stock prices increase because of a rise in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity."
13,"For the economy as a whole, the story is more complicated because the additional aggregate demand is likely to push up interest rates and limit the rise in stock prices."
14,"Both the productivity spurt itself and the induced rise in interest rates will then affect desired investment, international capital flows, and the trade balance."
15,"Suppose, instead, that stock prices increase because households are applying a lower discount rate to future profits."
16,The discount rate for profits--the sum of the risk-free interest rate and the equity premium--depends on other features of the economy.
17,"Hence, if the discount rate has changed, some other aspect of the economy must have changed as well--and that change may have effects on consumption separate from the effect of the change in stock prices."
18,"Another is that taxes may have been altered, and the move to a different fiscal policy would have changed the risk-free interest rate."
19,"To summarize the results for equities, there are three main lessons: At least in theory, changes in stock prices can have very different effects on consumption depending on their origin."
20,"Thus, thinking about profits and discount rates as separate influences on stock prices may be misleading when one considers economywide changes."
21,"Thus, changes in house prices that occur for different reasons may also have different effects on consumption."
22,Suppose that house prices increase relative to the prices of other goods and services because individuals become more patient and reduce the discount rate for future housing services.
23,"For example, population growth or immigration may push up the value of land close to major cities."
24,"These so-called ""downsizers"" are clearly better off when house prices increase relative to other prices, and we can expect them to increase their consumption of nonhousing goods and services."
25,These so-called upsizers may respond to an increase in house prices by reducing their consumption of other goods and services.
26,"Economic theory suggests that downsizers may generally have higher marginal propensities to consume out of housing and other forms of wealth than upsizers, which would give consumption a positive impetus from house-price increases."
27,"If they would like to consume more but cannot because unsecured borrowing is difficult, then at least modest increases in house prices should not reduce their consumption."
28,"In addition, its value is somewhat uncertain, although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed."
29,This research agenda is important for the advancement of economic understanding and the conduct of monetary policy.
30,"As you know, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have long-run goals of price stability and sustainable growth."
31,"To achieve these goals, these central banks take an active interest in all the factors that affect economic performance, including business and consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, fiscal policy, and so on."
