0,The price per barrel reached $37 in March and nearly $41 in May.
1,"Oil prices have continued to rise erratically since the spring, even as other commodity prices have generally stabilized and overall inflation has been low."
2,"As of last week, the price of a barrel of West Texas intermediate stood at about $55.2 Some perspective is in order."
3,"Oil prices are at record levels when measured in nominal terms, but when adjusted for inflation the price of oil still remains well below its historical peak, reached in 1981."
4,"Measured in today's dollars, crude oil prices in 1981 were about $80 per barrel, and the price of gasoline at the pump was nearly $3 per gallon."
5,"Clearly, the surges in oil prices of the 1970s and early 1980s had much more pronounced economic effects than the more recent increases have had or are likely to have, barring a substantial further rise."
6,"All that being said, prices of oil and oil products in the United States today are quite high relative to recent experience."
7,"During most of the 1990s, oil prices were roughly $20 per barrel, and for a short period in 1998 (remembered without fondness by oil explorers and producers) the price of a barrel of crude fell to just above $10."
8,"As I mentioned, only a year ago the price of oil was about $30 per barrel."
9,The recent rise in oil prices has thus been large enough to constitute a significant shock to the economic system.
10,The runup in oil prices raises a number of important questions for economists and policymakers.
11,Why have oil prices risen by so much and why do they continue to fluctuate so erratically?
12,What is the outlook for oil supplies and oil prices in the medium term and in the long term?
13,What implications does the behavior of oil prices have for the ongoing economic expansion?
14,And how should monetary policy respond to these developments?
15,"Before doing so, I should note that the opinions I express today are my own and are not to be attributed to my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.3 Recent and Prospective Developments in Oil MarketsTo assess recent developments in the oil market, it would be useful to know whether the high price of oil we observe today is a temporary spike or is instead the beginning of an era of higher prices."
16,"Although no one can know for sure how oil prices will evolve, financial markets are one useful place to learn about informed opinion."
17,"The prices observed in these markets can be used to obtain useful information about what traders expect for the future course of oil prices, as well as the degree of uncertainty they feel in predicting the future."
18,"One inference we can draw from recent developments in the oil market, in particular from the pricing of derivative instruments, is that traders in that market are unusually uncertain about how the price of oil will evolve over the next year or so."
19,"For example, as of last week, traders assigned about a two-thirds probability that the price of crude oil as of next June would be between $38 and $60 per barrel."
20,"Or, to say the same thing another way, traders perceived a one-third chance that the price of oil would fall outside the wide $38-$60 range."
21,"That well-informed traders would be so uncertain about what the price of oil will be only eight months in the future is striking, to say the least."
22,"However, probably more economically significant than near-term uncertainty about oil prices is the fact that traders appear to expect tight conditions in the oil market to continue for some years, with at best only a modest decline in prices."
23,This belief on the part of traders can be seen in the prices of oil futures contracts.
24,"Throughout most of the 1990s, market prices of oil for delivery at dates up to six years in the future fluctuated around $20 per barrel, suggesting that traders expected oil prices to remain at about that level well into the future."
25,"Today, futures markets place the expected price of a barrel of oil in the long run closer to $39, a near doubling.5 Thus, although traders expect the price of oil to decline somewhat from recent highs, they also believe that a significant part of the recent increase in prices will be long lived."
26,What accounts for the behavior of the current and expected future price of oil?
27,"The writer George Bernard Shaw once said that, to obtain an economist, it was only necessary to teach a parrot to repeat endlessly the phrase ""supply and demand."""
28,"For the most part, high oil prices reflect high and growing demand for oil and limited (and uncertain) supplies."
29,"On the demand side, the International Energy Agency (IEA), perhaps the most reliable source of data on world oil production and consumption, has continued to revise upward its projections of global oil usage."
30,"A significant part of this unexpected increase in oil consumption, about 2.2 million barrels per day, reflected quickly growing oil demands in East Asia, notably China."
31,"With oil consumption and prices rising briskly, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have promised to pump more oil."
32,"Interacting with the limits on capacity, and contributing to the exceptional volatility in oil prices of recent months, are uncertainties about the reliability and security of oil supplies."
33,"Because neither the demand for nor the supply of oil responds very much to price changes in the short run, the recent unexpected rise in oil consumption together with disruptions to supply can plausibly account for much of the increase in prices."
34,"However, the sharp increases and extreme volatility of oil prices have led observers to suggest that some part of the rise in prices reflects a speculative component arising from the activities of traders in the oil markets."
35,How might speculation raise the price of oil?
36,"Simplifying greatly, speculative traders who expect oil to be in increasingly short supply and oil prices to rise in the future can back their hunches with their money by purchasing oil futures contracts on the commodity exchange."
37,Oil futures contracts represent claims to oil to be delivered at a specified price and at a specified date and location in the future.
38,"If the price of oil rises as the traders expect--more precisely, if the future oil price rises above the price specified in the contract--they will be able to re-sell their claims to oil at a profit."
39,"If many speculators share the view that oil shortages will worsen and prices will rise, then their demand for oil futures will be high and, consequently, the price of oil for future delivery will rise."
40,Higher oil futures prices in turn affect the incentives faced by oil producers.
41,"Seeing the high price of oil for future delivery, oil producers will hold oil back from today's market, adding it to inventory for anticipated future sale."
42,"This reduction in the amount of oil available for current use will in turn cause today's price of oil to rise, an increase that can be interpreted as the speculative premium in the oil price."
43,"True, speculation may raise the current price of oil, but that increase is useful in stimulating current production and reducing current demand, thereby freeing up more oil to be held in reserve against emergencies."
44,"But speculators' profits depend on their ability to induce a shift in oil use from periods when prices are relatively low (that is, when oil is relatively plentiful) to periods when prices are relatively high (when oil is scarce)."
45,Social welfare is likely increased by informed speculation in oil markets because speculative activities make oil relatively more available at the times when it is most needed.8 This discussion suggests three indicators to help us detect the influence of speculative activity on current oil prices.
46,"First, if speculative activity is an important source of the rise in oil prices, we would expect today's oil price to react strongly to news bearing on future conditions of oil supply and demand."
47,"Second, we should see speculative traders holding claims to large amounts of oil for future delivery, in the hope of enjoying a profit by re-selling the oil should prices rise."
48,"The first indicator, rapid swings of oil prices in response to news about the prospective supplies and usage of oil, does appear to be present and to suggest a speculative element in pricing."
49,My tentative conclusion is that speculative activity may help to account for part of the recent volatility in oil prices.
50,"However, the available evidence does not provide clear support for the view that speculative activity has made oil prices during the past year much higher on average than they otherwise would have been.11 A rather different explanation of the recent increase in oil prices holds that the rise is in large part a symptom of inflationary monetary policies."
51,"The general idea is that, if most prices adjust slowly, the effects of an excessively easy monetary policy will show up first as a sharp increase in those prices that are able to adjust most quickly, such as the prices of commodities (including oil)."
52,"If this idea were valid, then commodity price movements could be used as a guide for setting monetary policy."
53,"However, the consensus that emerges from this literature is that the relationship between commodity price movements and monetary policy is tenuous and unreliable at best."
54,"Moreover, applied to the recent experience, economic models that support the use of oil prices as a leading indicator of monetary policy make a number of other predictions that are strongly contradicted by the facts."
55,"These predictions include (1) that all commodity prices should move proportionally in response to changes in monetary policy (in fact, oil prices have risen sharply since the spring as other commodity prices have generally stabilized); (2) that the dollar should have rapidly depreciated as the oil price rose (in fact, the dollar has been broadly stable during 2004); (3) that inflation expectations should have increased substantially (but long-term nominal interest rates, the level of inflation compensation implicit in inflation-indexed bond yields, and survey measures of inflation expectations concur in showing no such rise); and (4) that general inflation, though lagging commodity-price inflation, should also rise over time (but inflation excluding energy prices remains quite low)."
56,"Models of commodity-price ""overshooting"" also imply that the current surge in oil prices will be almost entirely temporary, a prediction strongly at variance with market expectations as revealed in the futures markets."
57,"I conclude that an increasingly tight supply-demand balance, rather than speculation or easy monetary policies, probably accounts for most of the recent run-up in oil prices."
58,"In that regard, we can safely assume that world economic growth, together with the rapid pace of industrialization in China, India, and other emerging-market economies, will generate increasing demands for oil and other forms of energy."
59,"If we are lucky, growth in the demand for energy will be moderated by continued improvements in energy efficiency that will be stimulated by higher prices and concerns about the security of oil supplies."
60,"Still, if the global economic expansion continues, substantial growth in the use of oil and other energy sources appears to be inevitable."
61,"But, on the other hand, today's proved reserve figures ignore not only the potential for new discoveries but also the likelihood that improved technology and higher oil prices will increase the amount of oil that can be economically recovered."
62,"Oil producers are also aware from painful experience that oil prices can fall as quickly as they rise; hence, exploration projects launched when prices are high may come to fruition when prices are much lower."
63,These risks help to explain why major oil companies have not rushed to increase exploration activities during this recent period of high prices.
64,"Thus, the supply-demand fundamentals seem consistent with the view now taken by oil-market participants that the days of persistently cheap oil are over."
65,"For example, the world has vast supplies of natural gas that, pending additional infrastructure development, might be transported in liquefied form to the United States, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere at BTU-equivalent prices below those expected for crude oil."
66,"Given enough time, market mechanisms (most obviously, higher prices) are likely to increase energy supplies, including alternative energy sources, while simultaneously encouraging conservation and substitution away from oil to other types of energy."
67,"Hence the next few years may be stressful ones for energy consumers, as stretched and uncertain supplies of oil and other conventional energy sources face the growing demands of a rapidly expanding world economy."
68,Economic and Policy Implications of Increased Oil Prices What are the economic implications of the recent increase in oil prices?
69,"In the long run, higher oil prices are likely to reduce somewhat the productive capacity of the U.S. economy."
70,Lower productivity in turn implies that wages and profits will be lower than they otherwise would have been.
71,The increase in the prices of our imports relative to the prices of our exports will impose a further burden on U.S. households and firms.
72,"Under the assumption that oil prices do not spike sharply higher from their already high levels, these long-run effects, though negative, should be manageable."
73,"As I have already discussed, conservation and the development of alternative energy sources will, over the long term, take some of the sting out of higher oil prices."
74,"Moreover, productivity gains from diverse sources, including technological improvements and a more highly educated workforce, are likely to exceed by a significant margin the productivity losses created by high oil prices."
75,"In the short run, sharply higher oil prices create a rather different and, in some ways, a more difficult set of economic challenges."
76,"Indeed, a significant increase in oil prices can simultaneously slow economic growth while stoking inflation, posing hard choices for monetary policy makers."
77,"An increase in oil prices slows economic growth in the short run primarily through its effects on spending, or aggregate demand."
78,"Because the United States imports most of its oil, an increase in oil prices is, as many economists have noted, broadly analogous to the imposition of a tax on U.S. residents, with the revenue from the tax going to oil producers abroad."
79,"Add to this the effects of the rise in natural gas prices, and the total increase in imported energy costs over a full year--the increase in the ""tax"" being paid to foreign energy producers--comes to almost $85 billion."
80,"Because high energy costs lower firms' profits, they normally reduce the willingness of firms to purchase new capital goods; however, if the increase in energy prices looks to be permanent, firms might decide that it makes sense for them to invest in more energy-efficient buildings and machines, moderating the decline in their capital spending."
81,"If higher energy prices reflect in part more rapid economic growth abroad--which seems to be the case in the recent episode--or if foreign energy producers spend part of their increased income on U.S. goods and services, then the demand for U.S. exports may be stronger than it would have been otherwise."
82,"With these and many other qualifications taken into account, a reasonable estimate is that the increased cost of imported energy has reduced the growth in U.S. aggregate spending and real output this year by something between half and three-quarters of a percentage point."
83,"At the same time that higher oil prices slow economic growth, they also create inflationary pressures."
84,"Higher prices for crude are passed through, with only a very short lag, to increased prices for oil products used by consumers, such as gasoline and heating oil."
85,"When oil prices rise, people may try to substitute other forms of energy, such as natural gas, leading to price increases in those alternatives as well."
86,"The rise in energy costs faced by households represents, of course, an increase in the cost of living, or inflation."
87,This direct effect of higher energy prices on the cost of living is sometimes called the first-round effect on inflation.
88,"In addition, higher energy costs may have indirect effects on the inflation rate--if, for example, firms pass on their increased costs of production in the form of higher consumer prices for non-energy goods or services, or if workers respond to the increase in the cost of living by demanding higher wages."
89,These indirect effects of higher energy prices on the overall rate of inflation are called second-round effects.
90,"The overall inflation rate reflects both first-round and second-round effects, of course."
91,"Economists and policymakers also pay attention to the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the direct effects of increases in the prices of energy (as well as of food)."
92,"By stripping out the first-round inflation effects, core inflation provides a useful indicator of the second-round effects of increases in the price of energy.13 In the past, notably during the 1970s and early 1980s, both the first-round and second-round effects of oil-price increases on inflation tended to be large, as firms freely passed rising energy costs on to consumers, and workers reacted to the surging cost of living by ratcheting up their wage demands."
93,"This situation made monetary policy making extremely difficult, because oil-price increases threatened to raise the overall inflation rate significantly."
94,"The Federal Reserve attempted to contain the inflationary effects of the oil-price shocks by engineering sharp increases in interest rates, actions which had the unfortunate side effect of sharply slowing growth and raising unemployment, as in the recessions that began in 1973 and 1981."
95,"Since about 1980, the Federal Reserve and most other central banks have worked hard to bring inflation down, and in recent years, inflation in the United States and other industrial countries has been both low and stable."
96,"An important benefit of these efforts is that the second-round inflation effect of a given increase in energy prices has been much reduced (Hooker, 1999)."
97,"Because households and business owners are now confident that the Fed will keep inflation low, firms have both less incentive and less ability to pass on increased energy costs in the form of higher prices, and likewise workers have less need and less capacity to demand compensating increases in wages."
98,"Thus, increases in energy prices, though they temporarily raise overall inflation, tend to have modest and transient effects on core inflation; that is, currently, the second-round effects appear to be relatively small."
99,"Although the difficulties posed by increases in oil prices are less than in the past, the economic consequences are nevertheless unpleasant, as higher oil prices still tend to induce both slower growth and higher inflation."
100,How then should monetary policy react?
101,"Unfortunately, monetary policy cannot offset the recessionary and inflationary effects of increased oil prices at the same time."
102,"If the central bank lowers interest rates in an effort to stimulate growth, it risks adding to inflationary pressure; but if it raises rates enough to choke off the inflationary effect of the increase in oil prices, it may exacerbate the slowdown in economic growth."
103,"In conformance with the Fed's dual mandate to promote both high employment and price stability, Federal Reserve policy makers would ideally respond in some measure to both the recessionary and inflationary effects of increased oil prices."
104,"Because these two factors tend to pull policy in opposite directions, however, whether monetary policy eases or tightens following an increase in energy prices ultimately depends on how policymakers balance the risks they perceive to their employment and price-stability objectives."
105,The relatively small effects of higher oil prices on the underlying inflation rate that we have seen in recent years are a consequence of the public's confidence that the Fed will maintain inflation at a low level in the medium term.
106,"As I have discussed, the public's expectation that inflation will remain low minimizes the second-round effects of oil price increases, which (in a virtuous circle) helps to limit the ultimate effect on inflation."
107,"Moreover, well-anchored inflation expectations have been shown to enhance the stability of output and employment."
108,"Maintaining the public's confidence in its policies should thus be among the central bank's highest priorities.14 For this reason, I would argue that the Fed's response to the inflationary effects of an increase in oil prices should depend to some extent on the economy's starting point."
109,"If inflation has recently been on the low side of the desirable range, and the available evidence suggests that inflation expectations are likewise low and firmly anchored, then less urgency is required in responding to the inflation threat posed by higher oil prices."
110,"In this case, monetary policy need not tighten and could conceivably ease in the wake of an oil-price shock."
111,"However, if inflation has been near the high end of the acceptable range, and policymakers perceive a significant risk that inflation and inflation expectations may rise further, then stronger action, in the form of a tighter monetary policy, may well prove necessary."
112,"In directing its policy toward stabilizing the public's inflation expectations, the Fed would be making an important investment in future economic stability."
113,"As a professor and textbook author, I was accustomed to discussing the effects of a particular phenomenon, such as rising oil prices, with all other factors held equal."
114,The increases in oil prices this year did not take place in isolation.
115,"Along with the rise in oil prices, increases in the prices of other important commodities, such as steel and lumber, as well as higher import prices resulting from the earlier decline in the dollar, provided supply-side pressure on inflation in early 2004."
116,"Meanwhile, an economic expansion that took hold in the middle of 2003 resulted in strong output growth but, as of early this year, limited progress in creating new jobs."
117,"As a final complication, the beginning of the year also saw the Fed's policy interest rate, the federal funds rate, at the historically low level of 1 percent, the result of the efforts of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to spark faster growth and minimize deflation risks in 2003."
118,"In January, with inflation low and the job market still weak, the FOMC indicated that it would be ""patient"" in removing the policy accommodation implied by the low value of the federal funds rate."
119,The increase in inflation that occurred last spring posed a choice for the FOMC.
120,"Should the Committee remain ""patient"" in the face of this development, or should it move more aggressively to meet an emerging inflation threat?"
121,"The answer, I would argue, properly depended on both the source of the inflation and the state of inflation expectations."
122,"In particular, if the pickup in inflation had largely resulted from an overheating economy and a consequent increase in pricing power and wage demands, a more-aggressive policy would have been appropriate."
123,"In that statement, the Committee suggested that the increase in inflation was due at least in part to ""transitory factors""--a heading under which I include the increases in oil prices, commodity prices, and import prices--and indicated as well that ""underlying inflation"" would likely remain low, which I interpret as saying that, with medium-term inflation expectations well contained, second-round effects appeared likely to be small."
124,"Thus far at least, the FOMC's diagnosis appears to have been correct, as both headline and core inflation have receded from the levels of last spring."
125,"However, future monetary-policy choices will not be closely linked to the behavior of oil prices per se."
126,"Rather, they will depend on what the incoming data, taken as a whole, say about prospects for inflation and the strength of the expansion."
127,"However, as always, the actual course of policy will depend on the evidence, including, of course, what we learn about how oil prices are affecting the economy."
