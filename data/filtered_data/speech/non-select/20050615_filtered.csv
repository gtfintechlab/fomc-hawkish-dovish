0,"But perhaps the most important thing we can do--as managers of financial institutions, as regulators, and as monetary policymakers--is to develop systems for our actions and reactions that can accommodate the unexpected--that is, we can become better managers of risk."
1,"Still, for most industrialized economies the macroeconomic fallout from the sharp decline in equity prices, from the spike in risk premiums and business distress, and from the revelations of corporate wrongdoing of a few years ago has been limited; in the United States, we experienced a mild recession."
2,"Second, monetary policy in the United States responded very aggressively to incipient declines in activity and inflation that resulted from the emerging problems."
3,"Business cycles have been damped since the early 1980s, and inflation has been low and steady in the United States and many other industrial economies for some time."
4,Most economic forecasts are for moderate growth and low inflation in the United States for the foreseeable future.
5,"To be sure, we see a range of views about just how much underlying strength the economy has, about the intensity of any inflation pressures, and about the path of interest rates that will be associated with continued growth and low inflation."
6,"The fundamentals, such as growth and inflation expectations and underlying financial conditions, appear to support continued good economic outcomes."
7,"Moreover, the flexibility and resilience of markets for finance and for goods and services, together with monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and high employment, should help damp the economic fallout from unexpected developments."
8,"However, although the most likely outcome for the overall economy is good, a number of characteristics of the current situation suggest some greater-than-usual risks around that central tendency, and, in particular, raise questions about the pattern of asset price movements that might accompany even favorable overall economic performance."
9,"The resulting current account deficit has risen to a record level, in excess of 6 percent of gross domestic product."
10,"The counterpart of the current account deficit is low savings generated here at home; in the past year, household saving out of current income fell to the unusually low level of about 1 percent."
11,"Several factors have contributed to the willingness of households to spend most of their income, but an important one has been the rapid and continuing rise in housing prices, which has boosted household net worth."
12,"That rise in turn probably reflects several influences, one of which has been low long-term interest rates."
13,These imbalances and unusual asset price configurations have persisted for some time.
14,The current account deficit has grown steadily since the mid-1990s; household saving rates have been on a downward trajectory for even longer; the low level of long-term interest rates and the rapid pace of house price increases have been the subject of much commentary for the past few years.
15,"At some point, global investors will require higher expected rates of return as their portfolios become increasingly concentrated in dollar assets; house price increases will encounter resistance as they rise relative to income and rents; as housing prices level out, households will recognize that they must increase saving out of income to have adequate resources for retirement; and the Federal Reserve already has been raising short-term interest rates as demand recovers from the shocks of recent years."
16,"Historic patterns of movements in interest rates, exchange rates, and house prices may not be very good guides to future relationships."
17,Who would have anticipated that the dollar would strengthen in 2001 as the Federal Reserve eased aggressively or that long-term interest rates would fall as we gradually reduced monetary accommodation over the past year?
18,And the risk of rapid adjustments and unusual configurations of asset price movements is higher than normal.
19,"Tail events, that is, asset price movements that are much more extreme than our usual experience, often appear driven by unique and idiosyncratic circumstances, so their implications are open to question and a challenge to risk managers."
20,Consider the management of market liquidity risk when asset prices are moving in unusual ways.
21,"Trades may be possible mostly at smaller volumes, and large trades almost surely will have greater price effects than normally observed."
22,"Other firms also may be trying to liquidate the same positions, creating further demands on diminished market liquidity."
23,Risk management must take into account the potential for the longer holding periods and more-severe asset price movements likely to be observed in such conditions and the possibility of concentrations of positions in some markets.
24,Managers of market risk typically mark positions to market and compute the value of positions under different assumptions about future price changes.
25,"More importantly, however, the dynamics of prices during tail events for individual assets and for assets in relation to each other likely are different from those observed in normal market conditions."
26,"But when contemplating more-unusual movements of asset prices, a firm must also consider the degree of correlation between default probabilities and exposures at default as well as the possibility of multiple, correlated downgrades."
27,"That said, the current imbalances, along with the unusual asset price movements of recent years and the investor behavior and expectations they reflect, offer clues to some of the extreme but plausible events that management should be considering."
28,Perhaps the most important contribution of the Federal Reserve arises in its conduct of monetary policy.
29,Our responsibility is to work to maintain a stable price level and economic environment.
30,Your problems would be compounded many times over by a surge in inflation and economic instability.
