0,"Significant job market changes in recent years, brought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and shifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important than ever before."
1,"In fact, two Federal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce development initiatives can fit within a bank's broader CRA strategy.3 While the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in lower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so essential."
2,"For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higher-income communities.4 The challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater."
3,The average unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.
4,"Also, a much smaller share of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with smaller minority populations.5 These elevated unemployment rates and depressed employment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce development options for these communities."
5,"And when they do attend college, those students are less likely to graduate.8 Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities.9 As a result, the proportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015 who had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higher-income communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10 This educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings."
6,"In December 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a bachelor's or higher degree was only 2.6 percent."
7,"However, the rate was nearly double, 5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11 While high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12 The advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for African Americans and Hispanics."
8,"First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to employment early in their work lives."
9,"The Federal Reserve's 2013 Survey of Young Workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19 Other studies have found that students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs improved participants' attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20 The findings point to some of the reasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called Pocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-olds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication."
10,"It delivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for unemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22 An evaluation of the program last year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, and it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other countries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our country as part of broader career and technical education efforts."
11,"The program has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24 Similarly, Washington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term increases in employment rates and hourly wages.25 My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a greater role in workforce development."
12,"Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income communities.26 Moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely to have paid employees.27 These findings speak to the opportunities that could be realized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their businesses."
13,"This situation is true for many minority, women, and low-income borrowers.30 Nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000 Community Development Financial Institutions around the country, help fill the gap.31 Conclusion To conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as well as other challenges, remain."
14,"Fortunately, programs such as the ones I have highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the Federal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy."
