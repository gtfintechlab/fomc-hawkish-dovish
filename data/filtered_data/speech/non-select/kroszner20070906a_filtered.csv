2,"If current conditions persist in mortgage markets, the demand for homes could weaken further, with possible implications for the broader economy."
3,"We continue to follow these developments in financial markets closely, particularly those that may have a broad impact on real economic activity."
4,Today I plan to offer some thoughts about ways to analyze and assess the impact of banking crises on real economic activity.
5,"Much of what I plan to discuss is based on a paper I published earlier this year with colleagues at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Luc Laeven and Daniela Klingbiel, titled ""Banking Crises, Financial Dependence, and Growth"".2 In particular, this research focuses on a key question for policy, namely, through what channels can financial turmoil have an impact on real economic activity?"
6,"Much work has been done on how financial intermediaries and financial markets facilitate investment by firms and, hence, promote economic growth.5 Financial intermediaries and financial markets are generally thought to reduce information asymmetry problems that can make raising external funds difficult and expensive for firms."
7,Well-functioning and well-developed financial intermediaries and markets thus should particularly benefit firms that rely most heavily on external funding to finance their growth.6 Conversely--and this is the novel aspect of our research--crises in the financial sector thus should have a disproportionately negative impact on firms that rely heavily on external sources of finance.
8,"If the banking system is the key element allowing firms that depend heavily upon external funding sources to finance their growth, then an impairment of these intermediaries--in a system where such intermediaries are important--should have a disproportionate contractionary impact on precisely those sectors that flourished in ""normal"" times, due to their reliance on banks."
9,"In other words, sectors of the real economy that rely heavily on external finance (that is, do not fund capital expenditures through cash flow) tend to experience a substantially slower growth of value added during a banking crisis than those sectors that do not rely so heavily on external funding."
10,"While these results are consistent with a so-called credit channel impact of banking crises on real economic activity, there are further implications of the ""credit channel"" view that we explore in more detail."
11,"Consistent with this, we find a greater negative impact of banking crises on growth for industries dominated by young firms that are highly dependent on external finance and for industries with high levels of intangible assets."
12,"While all of these results are consistent with a ""credit channel"" view of the impact of banking crises on real economic activity, we certainly need to explore some alternative explanations before drawing final conclusions."
13,"These results suggest that the ""credit channel"" effects on real economic activity we document are operating through the banking system."
14,"In short, the results highlight that a healthy banking system generally contributes to strong economic growth, and banking crises can present a substantial drag on the real economy."
15,So far I have been discussing results that focus on the real growth impact on sectors or industries.
16,"We use a variety of measures for individual firm performance, such as real growth in sales, real growth in earnings before interest and taxes, and real stock market returns."
17,"Interestingly, our recent work provided some evidence that past crises do not necessarily create a stoppage of bank credit to firms once ""normal"" times returned, but when the next crisis occurred, its impact on growth was usually deeper in magnitude."
18,"I have tried to provide a framework for analyzing the impact of banking crises on real economic activity, described some results analyzing crises from around the world during the last quarter century, and offered three policy lessons: the importance of a healthy banking system, of sound macroeconomic policy, and of high levels of transparency and disclosure."
