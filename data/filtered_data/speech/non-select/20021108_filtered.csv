0,"A statistician studying data from the Great Depression would notice the basic fact that the money stock, output, and prices in the United States went down together in 1929 through 1933 and up together in subsequent years."
1,"Are changes in the money stock largely causing changes in prices and output, as Friedman and Schwartz were to conclude?"
2,"By locating such episodes, then observing what subsequently occurred in the economy, Friedman and Schwartz laboriously built the case that the causality can be interpreted as running (mostly) from money to output and prices, so that the Great Depression can reasonably be described as having been caused by monetary forces."
3,"Four Monetary Policy Episodes To reiterate, at the heart of Friedman and Schwartz's identification strategy is the examination of historical periods in the attempt to identify changes in the money stock or in monetary policy that occurred for reasons largely unrelated to the contemporaneous behavior of output and prices."
4,The first episode analyzed by Friedman and Schwartz was the deliberate tightening of monetary policy that began in the spring of 1928 and continued until the stock market crash of October 1929.
5,"This policy tightening occurred in conditions that we would not today normally consider conducive to tighter money: As Friedman and Schwartz noted, the business-cycle trough had only just been reached at the end of 1927 (the NBER's official trough date is November 1927), commodity prices were declining, and there was not the slightest hint of inflation.2 Why then did the Federal Reserve tighten in early 1928?"
6,"The Federal Reserve had long made the distinction between ""productive"" and ""speculative"" uses of credit, and the rising stock market and the associated increases in bank loans to brokers were thus a major concern.3 Benjamin Strong, the influential Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a key protagonist in Friedman and Schwartz's narrative, had strong reservations about using monetary policy to try to arrest the stock market boom."
7,"Despite this sideshow and its effects on the timing of policy actions, it would be incorrect to infer that monetary policy was not tight during the dispute between Washington and New York."
8,"Hence this period represents a tightening in monetary policy not related to the current state of output and prices--a monetary policy ""innovation,"" in today's statistical jargon."
9,"Moreover, Friedman and Schwartz went on to point out that this tightening of policy was followed by falling prices and weaker economic activity: ""During the two months from the cyclical peak in August 1929 to the crash, production, wholesale prices, and personal income fell at annual rates of 20 per cent, 7-1/2 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively."""
10,"Hamilton showed that the Fed's desire to slow outflows of U.S. gold to France--which under the leadership of Henri Poincar√© had recently stabilized its economy, thereby attracting massive flows of gold from abroad--further tightened U.S. monetary policy."
11,"The policy tightening and the ongoing collapse of the banking system caused the money supply to fall precipitously, and the declines in output and prices became even more virulent."
12,"Again, the logic is that a monetary policy change related to objectives other than the domestic economy--in this case, defense of the dollar against external attack--were followed by changes in domestic output and prices in the predicted direction."
13,"Hence, although they suggest that declining output and prices followed these tight-money policies, the evidence is perhaps not entirely persuasive."
14,"This third episode occurred in April 1932, when the Congress began to exert considerable pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy, in particular, to conduct large-scale open-market purchases of securities."
15,"Wholesale prices started rising in July, production in August."
16,"Factory employment, railroad ton-miles, and numerous other indicators of physical activity tell a similar story."
17,"In particular, as argued by several modern scholars, they took the mistaken view that low nominal interest rates were indicative of monetary ease."
18,"Once Roosevelt was sworn in, his declaration of a national bank holiday and, subsequently, his cutting the link between the dollar and gold initiated the expansion of money, prices, and output."
19,Countries that adhered to the international gold standard were essentially required to maintain a fixed exchange rate with other gold-standard countries.
20,"Moreover, because the United States was the dominant economy on the gold standard during this period (with some competition from France), countries adhering to the gold standard were forced to match the contractionary monetary policies and price deflation being experienced in the United States."
21,"Although not conducting a formal statistical analysis, Friedman and Schwartz gave a number of salient examples to show that the more tightly constrained a country was by the gold standard (and, by default, the more closely bound to follow U.S. monetary policies), the more severe were both its monetary contraction and its declines in prices and output."
22,"As a result, it had the equivalent of a floating exchange rate with respect to gold-standard countries."
23,A decline in the gold price of silver had the same effect as a depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the Chinese yuan.
24,"From 1929 to 1931, China was hardly affected internally by the holocaust that was sweeping the gold-standard world, just as in 1920-21, Germany had been insulated by her hyperinflation and associated floating exchange rate."""
25,The effect of leaving gold was to free domestic monetary policy and to stop the monetary contraction.
26,"Fourth, and perhaps the worst hit, were countries that rejoined the gold standard but had very low gold reserves and banking systems seriously weakened by World War I and the ensuing hyperinflations."
27,"If the Depression had been the product primarily of nonmonetary forces, such as changes in autonomous spending or in productivity, then the nominal exchange rate regime chosen by each country would have been largely irrelevant."
28,"The close connection among countries' exchange rate regimes, their monetary policies, and the behavior of domestic prices and output, is strong evidence for the proposition that monetary forces played a central role not just in the U.S. depression but in the world as a whole."
29,"Of course, those familiar with more recent work on the Great Depression will recognize that Friedman and Schwartz's idea of categorizing countries by exchange rate regime has been widely extended by subsequent researchers."
30,They found that the countries that remained on gold suffered much more severe contractions in output and prices than the countries leaving gold.
31,"Bernanke (1995) showed that not only did adherence to the gold standard predict deeper and more extended depression, as had been noted by earlier authors, but also that the behavior of various key macro variables, such as real wages and real interest rates, differed across gold-standard and non-gold-standard countries in just the way one would expect if the driving shocks were monetary in nature."
32,"Because the decline in money induced by bank panics would not have occurred under previous regimes, Friedman and Schwartz argued, it can be treated as partially exogenous and thus a potential cause of the extraordinary declines in output and prices that followed."
33,"One logical possibility is that the extraordinary rate of bank failure of the 1930s, rather than causing the subsequent declines in output and prices, occurred because depositors and others anticipated the collapse of the economy--that is, that the banking panics were endogenous to the expected state of the economy."
34,A second possibility is that banking panics contributed to the collapse of output and prices through nonmonetary mechanisms.
35,They pointed out that (1) Canada's monetary policy was tied to that of the United States by a fixed exchange rate; (2) Canada had no significant bank failures; but (3) Canada's output declines were as severe as those of the United States.
36,"This proposition has been highly controversial and has led to detailed examinations of what Strong's views ""really were"" on various matters of monetary policymaking."
37,"And associated with these decisions, we observe a massive collapse of money, prices, and output."
38,"The best thing that central bankers can do for the world is to avoid such crises by providing the economy with, in Milton Friedman's words, a ""stable monetary background""--for example as reflected in low and stable inflation."
39,"However, as Athanasios Orphanides pointed out to me, by 1929 the rate of output growth was strong, which may have provided additional motivation for a tightening."
