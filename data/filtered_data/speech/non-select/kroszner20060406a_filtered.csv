0,"I am also pleased about the forward-looking nature of the conference on ""The Future of Financial Regulation"" and would like to express special thanks to two of our hosts at the LSE who have had much first-hand experience at policymaking, Sir Howard Davies, formerly of the U.K.'s Financial Services Authority, and Professor Charles Goodhart, formerly a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee."
1,"Just a month ago, in commenting on this position in a speech at the LSE on ""The Development of the European Capital Market,"" EU Commissioner McCreevy said, ""Protectionism denies everyone in Europe the economic benefits of market integration--higher growth, and more jobs."""
2,"""1 What I want to do in my remarks today is to focus on the economic consequences of removing cross-border barriers in banking to show that Commissioner McCreevy is correct: After the removal of barriers to the geographic expansion of banks, the United States experienced substantial gains in terms of banking efficiency, employment growth, and economic growth."
3,"Historically, banking in the United States has been subject to extensive government regulation covering the prices banks can charge, the activities they can engage in, the risks they can take, the capital they must hold, and the locations in which they can operate."
4,"But during the past thirty years, many restrictions on bank prices and activities in the United States have been lifted, including the restrictions on entry and geographic expansion."
5,"In the United States, economic performance improved after geographic deregulation, as evidenced by increases in the rate of state-level employment growth and the rate of new business formation."
6,"Volatility in the growth rates of employment declined, and the link between the health of local banks and growth in the local economy weakened."
7,"Moreover, this system has also has had positive effects on overall economic and employment growth."
8,"Regulatory changes appear to have led to meaningful improvements in the efficiency of banks, reductions in costs, and reductions in the prices of banking services."
9,"These cost reductions led, in turn, to lower prices on loans, although deposit interest rates changed little."
10,"It has been argued that efficient financial systems promote innovations; hence, better finance leads to faster growth (Schumpeter, 1969)."
11,"This argument has been countered by assertions that the causality is reversed; economies with good growth prospects develop institutions to provide the funds necessary to support those good prospects (Robinson, 1952)."
12,Recent theoretical developments have fleshed out two ways that good financial systems can lead to growth.
13,Financial markets can matter by affecting the volume of savings available for investment and by increasing the productivity or quality of that investment.
14,"These theories show that an improvement in financial market efficiency can act as a lubricant to the engine of economic growth, allowing that engine to run faster."
15,Empirical research provides support for the view that financial market development can play an important role in driving long-run growth.
16,"For example, one study finds evidence of a positive correlation between the size and depth of an economy's financial system and its future growth in per capita real income (King and Levine, 1993)."
17,"Although this evidence is appealing, it cannot rule out the possibility that financial development and growth are simultaneously driven by some common factor, such as good political or legal institutions, that may be difficult to fully hold constant in the empirical analysis."
18,The state-by-state deregulation of branching and banking restrictions provides a useful laboratory for investigating the effect of better banking on economic growth.
19,"First, after controlling for other factors, data on state-level economic performance over the period 1972 to 1992 suggests that state-level branching deregulation spurred faster economic growth (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996)."
20,"Second, evidence from 1976 to 1994 shows that state-level employment growth accelerated after the deregulation of intrastate branching as well as after the deregulation of interstate banking (Kroszner and Strahan, 2006)."
21,"Third, if more competitive banking really spurs growth, we would expect particularly large benefits among relatively bank-dependent sectors of the economy, such as small firms or entrepreneurs."
22,"Moreover, the magnitude of the effects of geographic banking reform on entrepreneurial activity are larger than their effects on the overall growth of employment."
23,"This differential effect makes sense because bank credit is most important in financing small businesses that do not have access to public securities markets; the effect suggests that the reason that growth accelerates after geographic deregulation is that credit supply to the entrepreneurial sector expands.9 Fourth, a more efficient and diversified financial sector might have an important effect on overall economic stability."
24,"Before the advent of geographic deregulation, there was a nearly one-to-one correspondence between state-level loan growth and state-level bank capital growth."
25,"Similarly, we also observe a weakened correlation between the growth of local employment and that of local bank capital, although the effect is less dramatic than the effect on loan growth."
26,"To recap, these benefits are likely to be greater banking efficiency (as more-efficient banks acquire less-efficient banks) and greater diversification of banks higher economic and employment growth, spurred by more-efficient and more-diverse banks more entrepreneurial activity, as the more bank-dependent sectors of the economy, such as small businesses and entrepreneurs, achieve greater access to credit reduced economic volatility, as the increase in their geographic diversification and efficiency allows banks to increase their portfolio diversification Barriers to Greater Banking Integration in Europe Of course, some of you may be thinking that I am overlooking significant structural obstacles to cross-border mergers in Europe and that such obstacles may make such integration less beneficial, on net."
