0,"As economic policymakers understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of September 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long-term economic growth."
1,This evening I would like first to review our recent experiences with prospective imbalances in energy supply and demand and the importance of market prices in resolving those imbalances.
2,"Technology alone is unlikely to restore the United States to the position of price leader, which characterized our role in world oil markets for most of the industry's first century."
3,The position of the United States in price leadership and in the exercise of pricing power in oil markets dates back to John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil.
4,"Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices in the petroleum industry's early years, he endeavored with some success to control them."
5,"After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing power remained with the American oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised allowable output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp declines."
6,"However, that historic role came to an end in 1971, when excess capacity in the United States was finally absorbed by rising demand."
7,"During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura in the Persian Gulf rose to more than $11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per barrel that prevailed unchanged from 1961 to 1970."
8,The sharp price rise of the early 1970s engendered an abrupt end to the extraordinary period of growth in U.S. oil consumption and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades immediately following World War II.
9,"Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of oil products rose at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth of real GDP."
10,"But despite OPEC's persistent endeavors to control oil prices, the story since 1973 has been more one of the power of markets than one of market power."
11,The signals provided by market prices have eventually resolved even the most seemingly insurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply.
12,The gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period was feared by many to be so large that rationing would be the only practical solution.
13,"To be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks accompanied slower growth of gasoline demand."
14,"Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that were imported into the United States markets increased significantly in the late 1970s after the Iranian Revolution drove up crude oil prices eventually to $40 per barrel."
15,"Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher."
16,The Department of Energy had baseline projections showing prices reaching $60 per barrel--the equivalent of more than twice that in today's prices.
17,The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of markets and the technologies they foster.
18,"Today, in real terms the price of crude oil is three-fifths less than in December 1979."
19,This was certainly the case for the concerns about potential surges in the price of gasoline this past summer.
20,"The reason, of course, is that producers and consumers alike react to price signals in ways that help to fend off the predicted disasters."
21,"In response to low inventories of home heating oil, prices rose, demand slowed, and we drew in large amounts of heating oil from Europe."
22,"In the event, retail prices peaked early last winter and have declined appreciably since."
23,"While the potential for a shortage of heating oil dominated concerns a year ago on the eastern seaboard, sharp increases in natural gas prices were threatening to markedly escalate the heating bills for the rest of the nation, which, in fact, they did for several months."
24,"A significant shortfall of gas in storage, brought about by growing domestic demand and a limited ability to import, had been a particular concern at the time."
25,"But since the start of the year, spot prices for natural gas have fallen significantly, largely because the earlier run-up in prices induced a dramatic rise in drilling, a boost to production, and a curtailment of demand."
26,"Of course, demand has also been restrained by the overall weakness of the economy."
27,Responses to rising prices were also a major factor in stemming California's electric power crisis of earlier this year.
28,"When higher prices for wholesale electricity were finally allowed to be passed on to households and industry customers last spring, demand slowed dramatically."
29,"To be sure, had California experienced average summer weather, the partial passthrough of cost increases to the retail level arguably would have been inadequate to equilibrate demand and supply."
30,"This was scarcely an exercise in free-market dynamics, but the experience did underscore that even the demand for electric power is price sensitive."
31,"Largely in response to past oil price increases, the energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced by almost half from the levels of the early 1970s."
32,"Much of the energy displacement was accomplished by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil."
33,"This more modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil prices that has prevailed since 1985."
34,One measure of the decline in the marginal cost of additions to oil availability in recent years is the downdrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of Light Sweet crude oil.
35,"Spot prices have soared and plunged over the past decade, but for the most distant futures contracts--which cover a time frame long enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil--prices generally have moved lower."
36,The most distant futures prices in 2001 dollars fell from $25 per barrel just before the Gulf War to $17 to $18 a barrel a year and a half ago.
37,"The long-term marginal cost of extraction presumably anchors the long-term equilibrium price and, thus, is critical to an evaluation of the magnitude and persistence of any current price disturbance."
38,"Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance between underlying supply and demand is restored."
39,The longer-term outlook for natural gas prices is less tied down by history or current practice.
40,"Unlike oil, the natural gas consumed in the United States, as you know, is almost solely produced in the United States and in Canada, from which last year we imported 16 percent of our 23 trillion cubic feet of demand."
41,"But with many of the transportation hurdles surmounted, demand has surged over the past two decades, reflecting the myriad new uses for natural gas in industry and as a clean-burning source of electric power."
42,"At times in recent years, supply has not kept pace with the growth of demand."
43,"As a consequence, spot prices of gas quadrupled, engendering a surge in domestic drilling."
44,The combination of demand for environmentally superior gas in our power plants and continued expansion of household and industrial use will be putting significant pressure on the reserve base as the economy recovers.
45,"Moreover, rapid technological improvements in coal mining have resulted in productivity gains in this industry that have exceeded those for the economy as a whole by a wide margin and have led to sizable declines in the relative price of coal."
46,Low prices for competing fuels and concerns about safety have been a drag on this industry.
47,"With rapid scientific advances, it is not inconceivable that technological breakthroughs will allow nonconventional energy sources to play a larger role in meeting our demand for energy than is currently the case."
