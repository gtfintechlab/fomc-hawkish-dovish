2,"As the population ages, the nation will have to choose among higher taxes, less non-entitlement spending, a reduction in outlays for entitlement programs, a sharply higher budget deficit, or some combination thereof."
3,"(This calculation ignores the possible effects of higher tax rates on economic activity, an issue to which I will return later.)"
4,"Besides tax increases, spending cuts, or reform of the major entitlement programs, the fourth possible fiscal response to population aging is to accommodate a portion of rising entitlement obligations through increases in the federal budget deficit."
5,The economic costs and risks posed by large deficits have been frequently discussed and I will not repeat those points today.
6,"Instead, I will only observe that, among the possible effects, increases in the deficit (and, as a result, in the national debt) would shift the burden of paying for government spending from the present to the future."
7,"In this counterfactual scenario, the ratio of workers to the overall population is assumed to remain at its current level over time and per capita consumption grows with productivity."
8,Perhaps the most straightforward way to raise national saving--although not a politically easy one--is to reduce the governmentâ€™s current and projected budget deficits.
9,"And slower growth in the labor force will motivate employers to retain or attract older workers--for example through higher wages, more flexibility in work schedules, increased training directed toward older workers, and changes in the retirement incentives provided by pension plans."
10,"First, restructuring the finances of our entitlement programs to minimize their reliance on deficit spending will enhance national saving and reduce the burden on future generations."
