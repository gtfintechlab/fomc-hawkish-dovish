0,"I will then discuss the primary sources of liquidity in the U.S. capital markets, and attempt to interpret signals from financial asset prices in this environment."
1,"Instead, market observers are more likely to be referring to liquidity in broader terms, incorporating notions of credit availability, fund flows, asset prices, and leverage."
2,"As noted, â€˜liquidityâ€™ in the sense of â€œtrading liquidityâ€ reflects the ability to transact quickly without exerting a material effect on prices."
3,"Underlying this concept is that while buyers and sellers have different views on the most likely outcomes--that is, after all what generates trading--they largely can agree on the distributions of possible outcomes for which they demand risk-based compensation."
4,"The benefits of greater liquidity are substantial, through higher asset prices and more efficient transfer of funds from savers to borrowers."
5,This extraordinary growth itself is made possible by remarkable improvements in risk-management techniques.
6,Interest rate risk and credit risk exposures are now more diversified.
7,Look no further than dramatic growth of the derivatives markets.
8,"In just the past four years, notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options tripled, and outstanding credit default swaps surged more than ten-fold."
9,Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C&I loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)--special purpose entities that buy C&I loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures.
10,"Hedge funds reportedly have served as willing buyers of these riskier positions, and we are all aware of their phenomenal growth."
11,Researchers have documented the so-called â€œGreat Moderationâ€ in which the U.S. economy has achieved a marked reduction in the volatility of both real gross domestic product (GDP) and core inflation over the past twenty years or so.
12,"In theory, reduced volatility, if perceived to be persistent, can support higher asset valuations--and lower risk premiums--as investors require less compensation for risks about expected growth and inflation."
13,Asset prices do appear somewhat correlated with volatility associated with the real economy and inflation.
14,The price-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms averaged 14 from 1960 to 1984 and rose to an average of 18 from 1985 to 2006.
15,"In addition, term premiums on long-term U.S. Treasury securities are estimated to have declined substantially since the late 1980s.4 Moreover, this decline is significantly associated with a reduction in uncertainty about long-run inflation and about short-term interest rates.5 Third, liquidity in U.S. markets also increased significantly in recent years due to increased international capital flows."
16,"Also, some of the fastest growing economies, especially in Asia, pursued export-driven growth strategies, thereby accumulating large reserves of foreign-denominated assets."
17,"In addition, high prices of oil and other commodities in recent years shifted income from importing nations to exporters, and research suggests that the bulk of these â€œwindfallsâ€ has been saved rather than invested.7 On net, the savings of less developed countries has been deployed to purchase substantial volumes of financial assets in markets in the most developed nations, most notably the United States and the United Kingdom."
18,"Implications for the Economy and Challenges for Policymakers Generally, high levels of liquidity offer substantial benefits to our financial system and overall economy through higher financial asset prices and a more efficient means to channel funds between savers and borrowers."
19,"Surely, policymakers must be vigilant to maintain output stability and low and anchored inflation expectations."
20,"In the aftermath of a financial shock, if buyers and sellers of credit can no longer agree on the distribution of possible outcomes, their ability to price transactions will be severely limited."
21,Monetary policy is no less challenged by the level and prospects for liquidity.
22,"We policymakers must ask whether liquidity conditions are obscuring signals from financial asset prices that we would otherwise use to gauge the performance of the real economy.9 Liquidity conditions could, in theory, lead to lower-than-justified risk premiums that stimulate aggregate demand or otherwise generate excessive inflationary pressures."
23,"Of course, inferences from market prices are always imprecise, because prices depend on expected growth, the variation surrounding that expected path, and investor risk aversion, none of which we can precisely observe."
24,"Typically, investors require compensation for the greater exposure to interest rate risk from holding longer-term securities, leading to an upward-sloping yield curve."
25,"The same factors that are contributing to liquidity--low uncertainty about inflation and output--are also driving down term premiums and, hence, long-term Treasury yields."
26,High liquidity could also obscure some information we glean from corporate bond prices.
27,"Naturally, one would expect that high levels of liquidity would lead to lower volatility as investors quickly force asset prices back to their fundamental values."
28,"If liquidity conditions and risk premiums of the last several quarters were the sole basis by which to judge the stance of monetary policy, it would be hard to conclude that monetary policy has been restrictive."
29,"Of course, the assessment of the stance of monetary policy also depends on a variety of other important factors."
30,Stable output and price stability have also been important contributors to liquidity and investor confidence by helping to anchor views about longer-term economic outcomes.
