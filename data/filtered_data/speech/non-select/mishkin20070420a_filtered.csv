0,"A slow start in 2002 was followed by three years of strong gains in real (that is, inflation adjusted) economic activity and a substantial decline in unemployment."
1,"Initially, monetary policy was very accommodative as the FOMC focused on providing support for the recovery and avoiding an unwelcome disinflation."
2,"From early 2003 to early 2006, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent--well above consensus estimates of its underlying sustainable rate--and the unemployment rate declined to 4-3/4 percent."
3,"Although such a transition will no doubt be marked by some bumps in the road, it represents a desired macroeconomic rebalancing that over the longer run can help ensure sustained non-inflationary growth."
4,One of the fundamental factors underlying the deceleration in real activity is the lagged effect of the FOMC's removal of monetary policy accommodation between June 2004 and June 2006.
5,Another source of the rebalancing is the substantial correction in housing markets that has been under way since last spring as the unrealistic expectations about home price appreciation that fueled the extended boom in homebuilding have been unwinding.
6,"With inflation expectations contained, I would expect such an economic environment to foster a gradual slowing over time in the rate of core consumer price inflation."
7,"However, the actual path for economic activity and inflation could, at times, be uneven; and as is the case for all forecasts, it involves a number of risks and uncertainties on both the downside and the upside."
8,"Turning first to the prospects for economic activity, two particular areas have emerged recently that have heightened uncertainty about the near-term outlook."
9,"Sales of existing homes strengthened a bit during January and February, and the Mortgage Bankers Association index of applications for home purchase suggests that demand has been fairly steady through early April."
10,"Real outlays for new equipment and software weakened in the final quarter of 2006, and the recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest that the softness in demand has extended into early this year."
11,Part of the weakness can be clearly traced to a decline in demand for investment goods that are used heavily in residential construction.
12,"In addition, demand for goods used by the motor vehicle industry also has softened of late."
13,"But, demand for other types of non-high-tech business equipment also appears to have slowed recently, raising more fundamental questions about business views on the current and prospective environment for capital spending."
14,Adding to the puzzle has been a weakening in demand for non-high-tech equipment even as financial conditions for investment have remained generally favorable.
15,"Interest rates and credit spreads are relatively low, and firms appear to have ample ability to raise funds at a reasonable cost."
16,The unwillingness of businesses to invest might be due to concerns about the prospects for long-term productivity growth and the expected rate of return on capital investment.
17,Demand for high-tech equipment appears to have picked up early this year after leveling off in the final quarter of 2006.
18,"Demand for computers, which was likely boosted by the introduction of the Windows Vista operating system, seems to be advancing at a healthy pace."
19,Technological innovations--such as circuitry that boosts computer performance and lowers energy consumption--appear to be generating demand to upgrade equipment in data centers.
20,"Monthly gains in employment, while down some from last year's pace, remain solid; the average monthly increase in nonfarm payrolls over the first three months of this year was about 150,000, compared with about 190,000 in 2006."
21,"To date, job cutbacks have been centered in industries related to residential construction and manufacturing, with no indication--either from the monthly labor market reports or the weekly unemployment insurance data--of widening weakness."
22,"In addition, the incoming information on consumer spending has been consistent with a moderate pace of demand."
23,"The steady labor market has been generating income; and despite the ups and downs in energy prices, real disposable income has been trending up at about a 2-3/4 percent rate since early 2006."
24,"And despite the deceleration of house prices, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income is still elevated."
25,"Economic activity also should be supported by fiscal policy, which is likely to remain mildly stimulative this year."
26,"On the international trade front, recent readings on economic activity abroad have been positive, which suggests that the demand for U.S. exports of goods and services will continue to be solid."
27,"And despite indications of moderation in some countries, the overall pace of economic activity in emerging economies, including China, appears to be strong."
28,"Turning now to the inflation outlook, in February the twelve-month change in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices was 2.4 percent, and in March the year-over-year change in the core consumer price index (CPI) was 2.5 percent."
29,"Prices of consumer goods in both the PCE and CPI measures have been relatively flat for the past two years, while prices of services other than energy and shelter have been rising at about a 3 percent rate."
30,My forecast of a gradual slowing in inflation reflects my view that making further progress in lowering inflation is desirable.
31,"Although I expect that core inflation will drift down, I recognize that achieving further reductions in inflation may take time."
32,"In the near term, the recent rebound in prices for gasoline and other petroleum-based goods is likely to put upward pressure on the costs of many non-energy goods and services."
33,"Moreover, the evolution of shelter costs, which have boosted core inflation over the past year, is difficult to predict."
34,Other concerns about prospects for inflation are related to developments on the supply side of the economy.
35,"The narrowest measure, the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, shows a noticeable pickup in wage inflation from 3 percent in 2005 to around 4 percent more recently; another measure, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector rose in 2006 at close to 5 percent, also faster than a year earlier."
36,But the employment cost index has been rising at a moderate 3 percent rate for the past two years.
37,Whether a pickup in nominal labor compensation will lead to upward pressure on inflation will depend on several factors.
38,"Importantly, an acceleration in compensation might be offset by higher labor productivity; indeed, during most of this expansion, strong gains in labor productivity have checked the rise in unit labor costs."
39,"And, with profit margins wide, businesses might accommodate increases in labor compensation without passing them on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
40,So how is labor productivity doing?
41,"Of course, I also recognize a potential downside risk to the outlook for productivity, especially given the weakness in business investment that I noted earlier."
42,"Nonetheless, averaging through the entire expansion to date, the underlying rate of productivity advance still seems to be close to the 2-1/2 percent rate that has prevailed since the mid-1990s."
43,"More fundamentally, I believe that long-run inflation expectations remain a key determinant of the path of inflation."
44,But what are the current expectations for long-term inflation?
45,"The results from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, readings on household opinion such as the Reuters/Michigan survey, and the spread between standard Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities--taken together--suggest that long-term inflation expectations are currently around 2 percent, although this guess is far from certain."
46,"Given my estimate of the current level of long-run inflation expectations as well as the likelihood of some easing of resource pressures in labor and product markets, I expect that core inflation will slow to around 2 percent over the next couple of years."
47,"Although I believe that inflation expectations will play a primary role in determining the course of inflation, I want to emphasize that neither economists nor policymakers understand the expectations-formation process very well."
48,"However, one aspect of expectations formation that we have come to regard as crucial is the credibility of monetary policy."
49,"Consistent with its dual mandate to foster maximum sustainable employment and price stability, the Fed must therefore continue to respond aggressively to shocks that have potentially persistent adverse effects on both inflation and real activity."
50,And we need to monitor long-run inflation expectations closely to avoid losing credibility with the markets.
