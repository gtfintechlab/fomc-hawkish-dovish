0,"The nation benefited from a productivity growth spurt that simultaneously raised real incomes, stock market valuations, the value of the dollar, and government revenues."
1,"The productivity growth spurt also held down unit labor costs, thereby improving the inflation-unemployment tradeoff."
2,"Since productivity is measured as the ratio of output to labor input, many things could in principle have caused such a growth spurt."
3,"The national saving rate is the portion of today's output that can be devoted to investment, which, by equipping workers with more capital, in turn feeds productivity growth and raises long-term living standards."
4,"Studies from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data suggest that half or more of the recent productivity growth spurt in the United States was due to capital deepening, with much of that facilitated by higher national saving."
5,This inflow from abroad financed part of the capital deepening and resultant productivity change.
6,"But even though foreigners financed part of the U.S. investment boom, national saving rates went up as well, keeping real interest rates low and investment strong."
7,The country managed to replace the high federal deficits (dissaving) of the 1980s and early 1990s with high federal surpluses (saving) in the late 1990s.
8,"Instead of soaking up private saving to finance rising Treasury debt, as happened in the 1980s and early 1990s, the federal government of the late 1990s paid down debt and freed up funds for private wealth holders to invest in real capital, which generated real productivity gains."
9,The national saving finances investment and vigorous economic growth.
10,"One form is that in purchasing some assets and not other assets, the Treasury might influence the structure of interest rates and distort the allocation of capital."
11,"Beyond that, such purchases would be equivalent to a sterilized foreign exchange intervention, under which the United States would be selling dollars to buy foreign assets without changing monetary policy."
12,Most academic economists find such interventions to have little impact on exchange rates.
13,"In a deeper sense, discussion on determinants of exchange rates seems ever-evolving."
14,Most macroeconomics textbooks feature the idea that high fiscal deficits causing high interest rates should attract capital and raise the value of the dollar.
15,"But lately it has seemed that high fiscal surpluses causing low interest rates but high investment, productivity change, and stock values might also raise the value of the dollar."
16,"And the point of a regime of foreign asset accumulation would be precisely to keep investment and productivity strong, and quite possibly the dollar strong."
17,"Conclusion The high government surpluses of the late 1990s have led to high rates of national saving, which has helped finance high rates of capital investment and has been an important factor in the recent upsurge in productivity."
