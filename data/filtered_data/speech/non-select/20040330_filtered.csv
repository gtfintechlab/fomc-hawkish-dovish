0,"Thus, if each of us focuses our efforts on just a few types of production and then trades our output with others, we can enjoy a far more varied and abundant supply of goods and services than we could if each person remained an isolated economic unit.2 Moreover, specialization tends to encourage innovation and hence promotes dynamism and growth as well as efficiency."
1,"A perennial public concern, from the emergence of the ""Rust Belt"" in the 1980s, to the days of Ross Perot's ""giant sucking sound,"" to the more recent debate about the effects of international outsourcing, is that the expansion of trade will cause production to move abroad, at the expense of domestic employment."
2,"Nevertheless, employment is certainly an important issue, particularly given recent experience."
3,"For example, imports of high-tech equipment have helped many U.S. firms, including large numbers of small businesses, to reduce costs and improve productivity, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in world markets."
4,"Second, although imports may compete with domestic production, they also improve the lot of consumers by giving them better variety in and better prices for the goods and services they buy."
5,Either type of foreign investment supports business expansion and employment domestically.
6,"If trade both destroys jobs and creates jobs, what is the overall effect of an open trading system on domestic employment?"
7,"Thus, in the long run, factors such as population growth, education and training, labor force participation rates, and labor market institutions determine the level and composition of aggregate employment."
8,"In contrast, trade appears to have essentially no role in determining a country's long-run employment potential."
9,"To illustrate, between 1960 and 2003, the U.S. trade balance went from a small surplus (that is, an excess of exports over imports) to a large deficit, equal to about 4-1/2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)."
10,"Yet the current unemployment rate of 5.6 percent is little changed from its level of 5.5 percent in 1960--a year in which, much like today, the economy was in the recovery phase from a recession."
11,"And of course, aggregate employment in the United States has grown greatly since 1960, by more than 60 million jobs."
12,"This increase in employment is significantly faster, by the way, than the growth of the population over the same period, in large part because of increased labor force participation by women."
13,Evidence from international comparisons also runs strongly counter to the view that trade depresses aggregate employment.
14,"Notably, despite its large trade deficit, the United States has experienced a significantly greater expansion in employment over the past decade than either Germany or Japan, both of which have enjoyed perennial trade surpluses."
15,"Although the labor force and labor-market institutions determine employment in the long run, short-run cyclical influences, such as transitory changes in spending or productivity, may cause employment to deviate from its long-run sustainable level."
16,"Even in the short run, however, there is no discernable link between aggregate employment and changes in trade volumes or the trade balance."
17,"For example, over the past two decades, even as U.S. trade has expanded rapidly, the quarter-to-quarter volatility of both output and employment has decreased noticeably, and recessions have become less frequent and milder than in earlier decades (Bernanke, 2004)."
18,"In recent years, the sharpest deterioration in the U.S. trade balance occurred between 1997 and 2000, a time during which domestic employment was growing at a rapid pace."
19,"In order to get some perspective on Kletzer's estimate of trade-induced job loss, then, we should compare it to the number of workers who are displaced each year in the United States for all reasons, including firm or plant closings, corporate restructuring, automation, or the ending of fixed-term employment."
20,"Hence, a reasonably conservative estimate is that, excluding seasonal and other short-term layoffs, about 15 million jobs are lost each year in the United States, equal to nearly 14 percent of the current level of nonfarm private employment."
21,"Although U.S. employment stagnated for an extended period after the recovery got under way and has recently risen only slowly, there is little basis for blaming the recent poor employment performance on import competition."
22,"The worsening of the U.S. trade deficit as a share of GDP in recent years is entirely due to a fall in exports, from 10.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2003."
23,"Thus, to the extent that trade patterns are contributing at all to the current weakness in employment, the more relevant concern is that foreign economies are not growing as fast as our own and hence are not generating as much demand for our exports as we would like."
24,"Even if the overall level of employment is largely unaffected by trade, some have argued that trade adversely affects the composition of jobs, for example, by replacing relatively high-paid manufacturing jobs with lower-paid service-sector jobs."
25,I will return shortly to the issue of why manufacturing employment has declined in the United States.
26,"For example, during the 1990s, average earnings in manufacturing industries that showed net declines in employment (weighted by the number of job losses) were $10.63 per hour."
27,"The debate about the effects of trade on employment has been intensified recently by an upsurge in trade in business services, popularly referred to as outsourcing abroad, or ""offshoring."
28,"For example, Catherine Mann (2004) has estimated that outsourcing abroad has reduced prices of IT hardware 10 to 30 percent, boosting the diffusion of information technology throughout the U.S. economy and raising both productivity and growth by a very significant amount--0.3 percentage point per year.7 The McKinsey Global Institute (2003) finds that for every dollar of activity outsourced to India, the United States receives between $1.12 and $1.14 in economic benefits.8 As with trade in general, it is useful to ask how much outsourcing abroad contributes to gross job loss in the United States."
29,"Quantitatively, outsourcing abroad simply cannot account for much of the recent weakness in the U.S. labor market and does not appear likely to be an important restraint to further recovery in employment."
30,"An underappreciated fact is that, in contrast to its trade deficit in goods, the United States runs a significant trade surplus in services."
31,"Between 1997 and 2001 (the most recent data available), employment of U.S. residents by affiliates of foreign companies operating within the United States increased by about 1.2 million jobs."
32,"Job losses in manufacturing have been particularly deep, with employment in that sector apparently only now beginning to stabilize after falling by almost 3 million jobs since 2000."
33,"I concluded then, and continue to believe, that the single most important factor explaining lagging job creation is the astonishing gains in labor productivity that have been achieved in the U.S. economy in the past few years."
34,"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased 4.3 percent in 2002 and 5.4 percent in 2003."
35,"For comparison, productivity advanced at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year from 1996 to 2000, a period that was viewed at the time to be one of exceptionally strong productivity growth."
36,"Most economists would agree that new information and communication technologies, together with organizational changes facilitated by those technologies, have been an important source of these impressive productivity gains."
37,"Note that, because the productivity figures are based on measures of domestically produced output and domestic employment, to a first approximation cost savings reflected by outsourcing abroad are not reflected in, and thus cannot explain, the recent surge in productivity.11 The gains in domestic labor productivity are great news for Americans in the long run, as they will promote higher wages, profits, and living standards in this country."
38,"In the short term, however, increased productivity has permitted the U.S. business sector to meet strong final demand for its output without having to hire significant numbers of new workers."
39,The effect of productivity gains has been particularly marked in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
40,"Productivity gains of 3.8 percent in 2001, 6.4 percent in 2002, and 5.8 percent in 2003 (as reported by the BLS) have permitted U.S. manufacturers to reach levels of production only about two percent below the cyclical peak in mid-2000, despite the sharp decline in employment.12 The general trend toward higher productivity and decreased employment in manufacturing has been observed for decades in the United States, although the process has recently intensified."
41,"For example, while U.S. manufacturing employment has declined 18 percent since 1990, the comparable figure for Japan is nearly 22 percent and for the United Kingdom it is more than 27 percent."
42,"Even China, supposedly the destination of U.S. manufacturing jobs, has seen manufacturing employment shrink by more than 15 percent since its peak in 1995.13 The long-run trend in manufacturing in the United States and other industrialized countries is similar to what occurred earlier in agriculture."
43,"However, agricultural productivity has improved so much over the years that, although farm workers make up only about 2-1/2 percent of the workforce, they are able both to feed the nation and (as noted earlier) export substantial quantities of food as well."
44,"The recent rates of productivity growth are unprecedented, and hence likely unsustainable."
45,"Thus, if output growth continues at its current robust pace, job creation will surely follow."
46,"However, because we do not know exactly how either productivity or aggregate spending will evolve, predicting the timing of a jobs resurgence is difficult."
47,"I have argued today that, in general, increased trade does not reduce employment and, more specifically, that trade bears little responsibility for the recent slow pace of job creation in the United States."
48,"For example, an analysis by Henry Farber (2003), using BLS data on workers displaced for any reason, suggests that only about two-thirds of displaced workers found re-employment within three years, with some settling for part-time work."
49,"In the short run, the costs of trade barriers include higher prices for consumers and higher costs (and thus reduced competitiveness) for U.S. firms."
50,"And history shows that in the longer run, economic isolationism and retreat from international competition lead to bloated, inefficient industries, lower productivity, and lower living standards."
51,"In particular, over time, appropriate monetary policies can help the economy achieve maximum employment with low inflation, irrespective of the trade situation."
52,"The TAA program offers up to two and a half years of job training, allowances for job search and relocation, and income support for eligible workers, the latter for up to 104 weeks after the initial 26 weeks of conventional unemployment insurance benefits have been exhausted."
