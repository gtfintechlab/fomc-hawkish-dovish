0,"There can be little doubt that the marked widening in our trade deficit on goods and services has played an important, possibly a critical role in supporting world stability during these trying years."
1,Domestic demand growth in the United States has accounted for about one third of the world total since 1996.
2,"Now that there are tentative signs that we may be through the worst of the crisis abroad, an issue to which I shall return shortly, it would be useful to address the benevolent, but bedeviling, question of how the American economy, at least to date, has managed to remain an oasis of prosperity, in sharp contrast to badly sagging economies in the developing world, recession in Japan, and tepid growth in much of Europe."
3,"Forecasts of inflation and of growth in real activity for the United States, including those of the Federal Open Market Committee, have been generally off for several years."
4,Inflation has been chronically overpredicted and real GDP growth underpredicted.
5,An increase in inflation doggedly forecast to follow the ever lower unemployment rate--now the lowest in three decades--has not occurred.
6,"In fact, even after accounting for the reduced bias in our price statistics resulting from methodological improvements, some measures of inflation have even continued to ease."
7,"Subdued inflation, of course, has resulted, in part, from the sharp fall in oil prices from mid-1997 through early this year."
8,"Moreover, there has been a significant weakening in non-oil import prices since 1995, owing largely to a combination of declining world commodity prices and a strengthening dollar in our foreign exchange markets through last summer."
9,"The decline in prices of oil and non-oil imports are clearly ""one-off"" events."
10,"Indeed, oil prices have moved up sharply of late."
11,The remaining easing in the inflation rate owes to disinflation in domestic value added excluding oil.
12,A pickup in the growth of labor productivity--beyond the effects of the business cycle--appears to have been an essential factor behind the slowing in inflation.
13,"Growth in labor productivity, which had averaged less than a 1 percent annual rate in the early 1990s, rose to approximately 3 percent in the four quarters ending in the first quarter of 1999."
14,Increased labor productivity growth has directly lowered the growth of unit labor costs.
15,"And that reduction in costs, in combination with declining import prices, has also apparently engendered lower price inflation and inflation expectations that, in turn, have curbed both nominal wage growth and unit interest costs."
16,"Consolidated unit nonlabor costs, excluding interest, have played little role in the inflation accounting exercise in recent years."
17,"Apparently, the effects of falling equipment prices have matched the upside influence of shorter service lives on the average depreciation rate to keep unit capital consumption charges stable."
18,I say that accelerated labor productivity is arguably at the root of declining domestic valued-added price inflation because it can be misleading to identify a single variable as the exogenous force in an essentially interactive process of cause and effect.
19,"But in this case, the notion that labor productivity acceleration has been largely, though not wholly, exogenous, appears persuasive."
20,Its unexpected emergence also apparently explains much of the shortfall in forecasting of overall economic growth in recent years.
21,"This, in turn, has reduced the relative size of the overall capital structure required to turn out our goods and services, and, as a consequence, has apparently added to growth of multifactor productivity, and thus to labor productivity acceleration."
22,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine."
23,"Owing to advancing information capabilities and the resulting emergence of more accurate price signals and less costly price discovery, market participants have been able to detect and to respond to finely calibrated nuances in consumer demand."
24,"They were unanticipated, and evolved, for the most part, independent of the ebbs and flows of economic activity."
25,"While the amount of capital investment that has carried these technologies into use has been, of course, affected by the costs of capital and labor, and by consumer demand, the rates of return offered by this new equipment have been largely rooted in the relative state of technology."
26,"It is the observation that there has been a perceptible quickening in the pace at which technological innovations are applied that argues for the hypothesis that the recent acceleration in labor productivity is not just a cyclical phenomenon or a statistical aberration, but reflects--at least in part--a more deep-seated, still developing, shift in our economic landscape."
27,"The evidence, nonetheless, for a technology-driven rise in the prospective rate of return on new capital, and an associated acceleration in labor productivity is compelling, if not conclusive."
28,"Instead, their growth increased through the remainder of the decade."
29,"The bulge in the exploitation of these ""excess"" potential rates of return has been stimulated by the accelerating decline in the prices of high-tech equipment starting in 1995."
30,The amount of capacity plowed into limited areas of technology led to extra heavy price discounting.
31,The rapid pace of innovation that has fostered shortened product life cycles also has contributed to driving down prices of high-tech equipment.
32,"This veritable army of technicians has been projecting increasingly higher five-year earnings growth, on average, since early 1995, according to I/B/E/S, a Wall Street research firm that compiles these estimates for the S&P 500."
33,"There appears little reason to doubt that analysts' continuous upward revisions reflect what companies are reporting to them about improved cost control, which on a consolidated basis for the economy overall, adds up to accelerating labor productivity."
34,"The alternative explanations--more rapid growth in earnings from operations abroad, a rising rate of increase in value-added prices received, or from an economy-wide prospective, ever faster labor force growth--are not credible."
35,"Thus, companies are apparently conveying to analysts that, to date, they see no diminution in expectations of productivity acceleration."
36,"This does not mean that the analysts are correct, or for that matter the companies, only that what companies are evidently telling the analysts about their productivity and profits are doubtless reflected in the longer-term profit projections."
37,The macroeconomic data to date certainly suggest little evidence of a slowdown in productivity growth.
38,"I said the evidence for technology-driven acceleration in productivity is compelling, but not conclusive."
39,"Indeed, there are a large number of economists who doubt that the rise in productivity growth is anything more than a cyclical phenomenon or some type of statistical aberration."
40,"To be sure, they say, nonfarm productivity growth has risen in recent years, but they note that there have been other periods in our postwar records that exhibited similar patterns of acceleration only to fall back to subnormal growth."
41,Many analysts offer as the explanation of the recent acceleration the slow pace of labor productivity growth earlier this decade.
42,The recent acceleration is admittedly not sufficient proof of an irreversible trend for a variable as statistically volatile as labor productivity.
43,"But catch-up or not, the evidence appears to be mounting that, even if productivity does not continue to accelerate, the pickup already observed does seem to explain much of the extraordinary containment of inflation despite the ever-tightening labor markets of recent years."
44,"The resulting slack in product markets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices, despite taut labor markets."
45,"Technology is also damping inflation through its effect on international trade, where technological developments and a move to a less constrained world trading order have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border trade."
46,"All else equal, the enhanced competition in tradeable goods enables excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries' markets."
47,The resulting price discipline also has constrained nominal wage gains in internationally tradeable goods industries.
48,"As workers have attempted to shift to other sectors, gains in nominal wages and increases in prices in nontradeable goods industries may have been held down as well."
49,"The process of price containment has doubtless become, to some extent, self-reinforcing."
50,Lower inflation in recent years has altered expectations.
51,"Because neither business firms nor their competitors can currently count any longer on a general inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs."
52,The availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to boost productivity.
53,"This contrasts with our experiences through the 1970s and 1980s, when firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capital investments."
54,It is difficult to judge how much of our benign overall price behavior during the past half decade is attributable to these significant shifts in the environment in which firms function.
55,"Undoubtedly, other factors have been at work as well, including those temporary oil and import price declines that I mentioned earlier and some more lasting influences that I have not discussed, such as worldwide deregulation and privatization, and the freeing up of resources previously employed to produce military products that was brought about by the end of the cold war."
56,"Over the longer run, of course, the actions of the central bank determine the degree of overall liquidity and, hence, the rate of inflation."
57,"It is, thus, up to us at the Federal Reserve to secure the favorable inflation developments of recent years and remain alert to the emergence of forces that could dissipate them."
58,"For, at root, it has been the remarkably quiescent inflation that has provided the favorable financial conditions and stable economic environment in which businesses have been able to function most efficiently."
59,That revaluation has induced a spectacular rise in equity prices that to many has reached well beyond the justifiable.
60,"As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of strong growth and low inflation to a close."
61,"Although productivity has accelerated in recent years, the impressive strength of domestic demand, in part driven by sharply rising equity prices, has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has been inadequate to prevent us from steadily depleting the pool of available workers."
62,This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue without eventually putting increasing pressure on labor markets and on costs.
63,"The rapid increase in aggregate demand has generated growth of employment in excess of the growth in population, causing the number of potential workers to fall since the mid-1990s at a rate of a bit under one million annually."
64,We cannot judge with precision how far this level can decline without sparking upward pressures on wages and prices.
65,"Accelerating productivity may have appeared to break the link between labor market conditions and wage gains in recent years, but it cannot have changed the law of supply and demand."
66,"At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will then eventually begin to accelerate."
67,"Under those circumstances, inflation premiums embodied in long-term interest rates would doubtless rise."
68,"The attendant increased risk premiums would boost real interest rates as well, as investors become less certain about future price prospects."
69,"The latter has unquestionably been a key factor in the rise in domestic demand, which despite productivity improvements has exerted increasing pressure on labor markets."
70,"Thus, should equity markets retrench, consumer and business investment demands would, doubtless, weaken considerably."
71,"A more distant concern, but one that cannot be readily dismissed, is the very condition that has enabled the surge in American household and business demands to help sustain global stability: our rising trade and current account deficits."
72,"There is a limit to how long and how far deficits can be sustained, since current account deficits add to net foreign claims on the United States."
73,The rate of growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely.
74,"While there appears to be considerable expectation in the business community, and possibly Wall Street, that the productivity acceleration has not yet peaked, history advises caution."
75,"Hence, despite the remarkable progress witnessed to date, we have to be quite modest about our ability to project the future of technology and its implications for productivity growth and for the broader economy."
76,"For, if productivity growth should level out or actually falter because additional technology synergies fail to materialize, or because output per hour has been less tied to technology in the first place, inflationary pressures could reemerge, possibly faster than some currently perceive feasible."
77,"For, obviously if productivity growth slows, unit labor costs would rise, first pressuring profit margins, and then prices."
78,"Indeed, we cannot rule out such a process if labor productivity growth simply levels out."
79,"Our ability to forecast, when a diminishing pool of potential workers begins to raise costs or when productivity trends change, is limited."
80,"We do know, however, that if, and when, either materializes, inflation pressures are likely to again surface."
81,"In Europe, gains in real GDP have remained modest, though inflation appears nonexistent."
