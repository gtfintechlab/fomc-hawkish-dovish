0,"Although prices for some commodities have risen, underlying consumer price inflation only now looks to be stabilizing at a low level after falling for some time."
1,"After averaging just 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first half of last year, the pace of real GDP growth surged to more than 6 percent in the second half."
2,"For 2003 as a whole, the pace of growth was the fastest since 1999."
3,"Supported importantly by last summer's tax cuts, low interest rates, and rising household wealth, consumer spending continued to trend up, while low mortgage rates have kept both home sales and new housing starts close to record highs."
4,"Against this backdrop, inflation has remained quite low despite some sizable increases in energy prices."
5,"Overall, the consumer price index increased 1.7 percent over the twelve months ending in February, while the core index--which excludes the volatile food and energy components--increased only a little more than 1 percent."
6,Outlook and Labor Market Uncertainties The consensus in the forecasting community is that GDP growth will not continue at the 6 percent pace posted in the second half of last year.
7,"But, with interest rates still quite low and fiscal policy generally stimulative, most forecasters are projecting relatively robust gains in output for the coming year, with ongoing increases in both household and business spending."
8,"Even so, the level of private employment remains more than 500,000--or 1/2 percent--below that at the trough of the recession in November 2001."
9,"For example, employment rose about 2 percent in the twenty-eight months following the 1990-91 recession."
10,"And, in the other seven post-World War II recoveries, employment growth averaged more than 8 percent over a period of comparable length."
11,"Economic forecasters' consensus is that, as the expansion matures, employment will continue to improve sufficiently to make noticeable gains in the utilization of labor resources."
12,But any meaningful explanation must account for the surprising strength in productivity growth in recent years.
13,"In particular, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose 4-1/4 percent in 2002 and nearly 5-1/2 percent in 2003, the largest back-to-back increases since the early 1960s."
14,"If so, then some of the surprising weakness in employment growth and some of the strength in productivity may have reflected a tendency by employers to stretch their existing work forces beyond a level that is sustainable in the longer run."
15,The sizable increase over the past year in employment at temporary help agencies--another potential margin of adjustment for firms unwilling to take on permanent employees--is consistent with this view.
16,The chief argument against this story is that the combination of a weak labor market and strong productivity growth has been ongoing for quite some time.
17,And it certainly seems possible that a portion of the extraordinary productivity growth of recent years represents a permanent increase in efficiency.
18,"According to proponents of this view, some of these productivity improvements may have resulted from firms' focusing on restructuring and cost-cutting in ways that provide ongoing efficiencies."
19,"Regardless of its source, however, the possibility that some of the productivity improvement--and some of the job cuts--of recent years are permanent suggests that the weak labor market may, in part, be associated with an increase in the economy's potential output."
20,"Moreover, during the second half of the 1990s, when pension plans were overfunded and, in many cases, improving the bottom lines of firms, one rarely, if ever, heard anecdotes suggesting that low pension-funding costs were boosting employment."
21,"Again, however, the magnitude of this phenomenon seems too small to explain more than a small part of the decline in employment over the past two years."
22,"Moreover, because outsourcing abroad represents a shift of both production and labor input to a foreign country, outsourcing is probably not a major explanation for our recent history of elevated productivity growth."
23,"In the short-term, the weakness in the labor market reflects a shortfall of aggregate demand relative to the economy's potential, which is an important part of the rationale for the currently accommodative stance of monetary policy."
24,"Obviously, we monetary policy makers will have to determine the degree to which the improvements in the labor market signaled in the most recent report indicate that the economy is meaningfully closing the gap between aggregate demand and the economy's productive capability, and the pace with which that gap is being narrowed."
25,But we also have to recognize that maintaining the current level of the funds rate for too long will eventually result in an unwelcome increase in inflationary pressures.
26,"In the longer run, it is important that we as a society recognize the considerable economic benefits associated with sustainable increases in productivity and intensify our efforts to ensure that as many individuals as possible profit from the substantial productivity gains associated with innovation and increased competition."
27,An improvement of this type would pay handsome dividends in many respects--allowing not only workers who retain their jobs to be more productive and earn higher wages but also allowing those who lose their jobs to gain reemployment in more stable jobs with less loss in earning power.
28,"For our future workforce, we must ensure that our educational system is adequately equipping students with the greater skills demanded by employers operating in an increasingly complex economy."
29,"Indeed, with house prices rising rapidly and interest rates at historically low levels, mortgage borrowing surged 12-1/2 percent in each of the past two years, twice the rate of growth of disposable income."
30,"The debt service ratio captures such things as the effects of changes in interest rates, loan maturities, and loan demand on the debt obligations of households."
31,"In essence, the research says that--after taking account of current and expected income, wealth, and interest rates--debt burdens, delinquency rates, and the like do not provide significant additional value in explaining movements in consumer spending."
32,Some commentators have argued that the real fragility in the system will be exposed when interest rates return to more-normal levels.
33,"It is important to recognize, however, that an increase in short-term interest rates does not automatically increase household debt payments across the board."
34,"The empirical evidence suggests that, in the face of rising interest rates, households curb their use of debt enough to almost entirely offset the higher average cost of debt, leaving debt burdens little changed."
35,Another factor that tempers my concern is that interest rates will rise from their current low level only when the economic expansion is on more solid footing.
36,"Thus, while households very likely will, at some point in the future, face a higher cost of credit on new borrowing, they will also be undertaking that new borrowing against a backdrop of greater job security and continued strong growth of incomes."
37,"Over the past year, the economy has made considerable progress: Aggregate income is growing rapidly, business investment has begun to recover, the stock market has rebounded, and interest rates and inflation remain very low."
