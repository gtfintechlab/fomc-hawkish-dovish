0,"Unless checked, such a seizing-up of the financial system can lead to a precipitous drop in lending and a steep decline in economic activity."
1,"Therefore, a stable financial system is of vital importance for the Federal Reserve if it is to pursue its statutory goals of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices."
2,"As lenders pull back and liquidity becomes scarce, a period of financial instability can ensue, carrying with it, as I mentioned at the outset, the threat of a serious decline in economic activity through a virtual cessation of lending."
3,"The first type, and the one that has been the catalyst of many past crises, is a sharp increase in interest rates."
4,"Higher interest rates increase the likelihood that borrowers will be poor credit risks because those taking on more risk are the most willing to pay the higher rates; not surprisingly, lenders have many times responded to sharp increases in interest rates by cutting back the supply of loans, which results in credit rationing."
5,"The harmful effects of balance sheet deterioration were evident in recent months, when concerns about borrower financial positions caused lenders to demand a substantial premium on loans and even to drastically cut the flow of credit."
6,"Nevertheless, the banking system periodically suffered panics, as the demand for liquidity often exceeded what New York institutions could provide."
7,"During these episodes, interest rates tended to spike and equity markets to decline, often sharply.3 The Panic of 1907, the subject of this conference, was the last panic of the National Banking Era and one of the most severe."
8,"During the summer of 1907, U.S. financial institutions, especially those in New York, came under increasing pressure as interest rates crept up and U.S. gold reserves declined; those movements were due in part to increases in interest rates abroad as foreign central banks sought to maintain their gold reserves.4 The panic started in October with a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, one of the largest financial institutions at the time."
9,"The stock market crashed, and the resulting surge in demand for liquid assets by banks that had New York correspondents, as well as by the general public, caused a sharp rise in interest rates, the failure of a number of financial institutions, and widespread suspensions of convertibility of deposits into currency."
10,"Thus, even fairly moderate increases in demand for high-powered money led to higher interest rates."
11,"In addition, some of the increases in the demand for money were not random; they were associated with the crop cycle and were thus seasonal.6 Just as no existing mechanism or institution could quickly supply the liquidity needed to respond to a rise in the demand for money, none could supply it to resolve the ensuing crisis."
12,The establishment of the Federal Reserve provided the nation with an institution that was able to expand the money supply to virtually eliminate seasonal fluctuations in interest rates and thus mitigate the stress such fluctuations might put on the financial system.
13,"The founders tended to focus on the ability to rediscount commercial loans at the discount window, which was seen as a way of providing an elastic currency that would eliminate crises or at least mitigate them.7 The Federal Reserve as a Liquidity Provider In past research, I have examined the importance of liquidity provisions by central banks in overcoming the problem of asymmetric information, exacerbated by the increase in interest rates, and the uncertainty that generally accompany a financial crisis (Mishkin, 1997)."
14,"Increased liquidity can help restrain rising interest rates and, amid an environment of heightened uncertainty, enable the institutions best able to make judgments about the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers to provide credit."
15,"At other times, the Federal Reserve has changed interest rate ceilings or used open market operations."
16,"Second, the Federal Reserve (along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) suspended the interest rate ceilings imposed by the Federal Reserve's Regulation Q on some large certificates of deposit, thus providing banks another means of financing increases in loans."
17,"Also, to help address the heightened safe-haven demands for Treasury securities, the Federal Reserve announced a temporary reductionâ€‘â€‘from 100 basis points to 50 basis pointsâ€‘â€‘in the minimum fee for borrowing securities from the System Open Market Account."
18,The provision of liquidity should thus be seen as a key tool for the Federal Reserve in its quest to achieve its statutory objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.
19,"Indeed, the Federal Reserve's standing facility charges an interest rate above the target federal funds rate for exactly that reason (Madigan and Nelson, 2002)."
20,Having a discount facility at its disposal provides a central bank with a more targeted tool for coping with financial disturbances without promoting inflationary tendencies.
