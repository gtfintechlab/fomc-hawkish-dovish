0,"In what may or may not be coincidence, at least the last three recession periods in the United States--those of 1990-91, 1980-82, and 1974-75--were preceded by spikes in the price of oil."
1,"Obviously, caution is required in drawing generalizations from only three observations, and indeed many analysts do not place much credence in the link between oil prices and the business cycle."
2,"In part, this skepticism arises because the largely linear models that typically economists rely upon to track the ties between energy prices and gross domestic product do not signal a worrisome linkage."
3,"When simulated over periods with observed oil price spikes, the models do not show oil prices consistently having been a decisive factor in the subsequent economic downturns."
4,"Our heightened wariness about recent developments, however, reflects the possibility that the responsiveness of U.S. gross domestic product to energy prices may be different when households and businesses are confronted with abnormal price hikes."
5,"Because economic models typically are fit over both those periods with price spikes and the more predominant periods of moderate price fluctuation, their estimated statistical relationships would not fully capture the effect of sudden and sizable shifts in oil prices on the economy."
6,"Pending the development of far better insights into the actual impact of oil price spikes than currently can be gleaned from macroeconomic models, it is prudent to follow energy markets far more closely than our models would suggest is necessary."
7,One important channel through which changes in the prices of oil and of other forms of energy unequivocally influence the economy is through their effects on the profitability of non-energy corporations.
8,"As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices."
9,"Rising natural gas prices, resulting from a significant shortfall in gas storage brought about by growing domestic demand and a limited ability to import, have been a particular concern."
10,"But since the start of the year, spot prices for natural gas have fallen significantly as the earlier run-up in prices induced a dramatic rise in drilling, a boost to output, and curtailed demand."
11,"Falling spot prices are being reflected, with a lag, in lower contract gas prices paid by U.S. businesses."
12,"Electric power costs continued to rise through May, but overall energy prices paid in April and May were down from the levels of the first quarter, suggesting some easing in pressures on profit margins from energy this quarter."
13,"We are also experiencing a decline of retail gasoline prices, which also had been rising sharply over the past couple of years."
14,That run-up was of particular concern because in the past steep increases in the price of gasoline have arguably undermined both the real purchasing power and the confidence of consumers.
15,This effect has likely been an avenue through which previous spikes in the price of crude oil have slowed economic activity.
16,The jump in gasoline prices from March through May was wholly the result of a twenty cent per gallon surge in gross refining margins.
17,"In recent weeks, however, refinery margins have declined noticeably, easing gasoline prices at the pump, especially here in the Midwest."
18,"The pressure on these facilities impeded the conversion of the substantial buildup of crude oil inventories that occurred since early March into gasoline and, as a consequence, gasoline prices at retail continued to increase through early May."
19,"As was the case in 2000, some sharp regional differences in gasoline prices have emerged again this year."
20,"At the start of the summer, prices in the Midwest were running well above the national average again."
21,"Consequently, the ability to move gasoline from areas of surplus to deficit is far more limited than it was a decade ago, and any given degree of overall gasoline price containment requires higher levels of gasoline inventories than would be the case otherwise."
22,Elevated domestic prices have damped demand and even drawn increased quantities of gasoline from European refineries in recent months.
23,"Wholesale prices, as a result, are down substantially from their peaks."
24,"We cannot be certain, of course, that the recent spike in gasoline prices in the United States is behind us, especially when crude oil supplies are never fully secure because of the unpredictability of events in the Middle East."
25,"Nonetheless, it is encouraging that in market economies well-publicized forecasts of crises, such as earlier concerns about gasoline price surges this summer, more often than not fail to develop, or at least not with the frequency and intensity proclaimed by headline writers."
26,The reason is that producers and consumers alike react to price signals in ways that help to prevent the predicted disasters.
27,"In response to low inventories of home heating oil, prices went up, demand slowed, and we drew in large amounts of heating oil from Europe."
28,"In the event, retail prices for heating oil peaked early in the season and have declined appreciably since."
29,"There is evidence that higher prices for electricity are beginning to damp demand, which is down significantly from a year ago as a consequence of increases in retail prices since December that will reach roughly 40 to 50 percent."
30,Wholesale power supply contract prices for third-quarter delivery have recently fallen to their lowest levels this year.
31,"Of course, to assume that California is going to be able to avoid serious problems as the full brunt of demands for energy mount this summer would be foolhardy."
32,No other area of the United States has experienced the potential supply-demand imbalance in electric power that currently confronts California.
33,"Historically, public utility commissions, there as elsewhere, set prices in order to deliver a guaranteed rate of return on capacity, whether it was used or not."
34,For a variety of reasons--including a failure to expand capacity in response to increased demand--the previous summertime buffer in California has by now largely disappeared.
35,"Because inventory buffers are not feasible for electrical systems, capacity buffers must absorb the full brunt of supply-demand imbalances."
36,"Such a system, confronted with relatively inelastic demand, cannot avoid extreme price increases or, alternatively, blackouts when demand for power plus an operationally minimal capacity buffer approaches or exceeds available supply."
37,"If new capacity is not available in such circumstances, demand must fall."
38,"It will fall voluntarily in response to high prices or other forms of conservation that dissuade less essential uses, or it will fall through brownouts, blackouts, or other forms of involuntary rationing."
39,Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants.
40,But there are no financial fixes to the imbalance of supply and demand for power.
41,"Until new capacity is put in place or demand is constrained by higher prices, rationing, time-of-day metering, or voluntary restraint, electricity prices will remain unstable and ready availability of power will be uncertain."
42,"Largely in response to past oil price increases, the energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced by almost half from the levels of the early 1970s."
43,"Much of the energy displacement was accomplished by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil."
44,"This more modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil prices that has prevailed since 1985, and which carried over into natural gas and electric power prices."
45,One measure of the decline in the marginal cost of additions to oil availability in recent years is the downdrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of Light Sweet crude oil.
46,"Spot prices have soared and plunged, but for the most distant futures contracts--which cover a time frame long enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil--prices generally have moved lower over the past decade."
47,The most distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel just before the Gulf War to $17 to $18 a barrel a year ago.
48,"The long-term marginal cost of extraction presumably anchors the long-term equilibrium price and, thus, is critical to an evaluation of the magnitude and persistence of any current price disturbance."
49,"Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance between underlying supply and demand is restored."
50,The longer-term outlook for natural gas prices is less tied down by history or current practice.
51,"Unlike oil, the natural gas consumed in the United States, as you know, is almost solely produced in the United States and in Canada, from which last year we imported 16 percent of our 23 trillion cubic feet of demand."
52,"But with many of the transportation hurdles surmounted, demand has surged over the past two decades, reflecting the myriad new uses for natural gas in industry and as a clean-burning source of electric power."
53,"At times in recent years, supply has not kept pace with the growth of demand."
54,"As a consequence, spot prices of gas quadrupled, engendering a huge surge in domestic drilling."
55,The combination of demand for environmentally superior gas in our power plants--virtually all new electric power facilities now on the drawing board are gas fired or dual-fired--and continued expansion of household and industrial use is putting significant pressure on the reserve base.
56,"Moreover, rapid technological improvements in coal mining have resulted in productivity gains in this industry that have exceeded those for the economy as a whole by a wide margin and led to sizable declines in the relative price of coal."
57,Low prices for competing fuels and concerns about safety have been a drag on this industry.
58,"With rapid scientific advances, it is not inconceivable that technological breakthroughs will allow nonconventional energy sources to play a larger role in meeting our demand for energy than is currently the case."
