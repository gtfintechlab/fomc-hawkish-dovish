1,"In response to these developments, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of measures to help ensure the normal functioning of financial markets and to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."
2,"The rate of economic expansion slowed somewhat in late 2006 and early 2007, but growth in the second quarter was solid and some of that momentum appears to have carried over into the third quarter."
3,"The pace of private-sector job creation has slowed this year, but the unemployment rate has moved up only a little from its recent lows."
4,"And, although energy prices have been volatile, indicators of the underlying inflation trend, such as core inflation, have moderated since the middle of last year."
5,Moderate growth in overall economic activity has continued despite a notable contraction in the housing sector that began in the second half of 2005.
6,"The housing correction has intensified this year as demand has declined further, inventories of unsold new homes have climbed relative to sales, and house prices have decelerated, with some areas of the country experiencing outright declines in home values."
7,"In response to weak demand and bloated inventories, homebuilders have sharply curtailed new construction."
8,The decline in residential investment directly subtracted about 3/4 percentage point from the average pace of U.S. economic growth over the past year and a half.
9,"With the softness in house prices likely to make refinancing more difficult, delinquencies on these mortgages are expected to rise further."
10,"Liquidity dried up, prices fell, and spreads widened."
11,"Demand for leveraged loans slowed sharply, reducing credit access for private equity firms and other borrowers seeking to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs)."
12,"And although equity prices have moved up on balance since late spring, swings in prices have been large; indeed, the expected stock-price volatilities implicit in options prices roughly doubled during the summer before falling back more recently."
13,"To some extent, the outsized effects of the subprime mortgage problems on financial markets may have reflected broader concerns that problems in the U.S. housing market might restrain overall economic growth."
14,"In the shorter term, however, these developments do imply a greater measure of financial restraint on economic growth as credit becomes more expensive and difficult to obtain."
15,One source of pressure in the overnight market was the demand for dollar funding by European banks to which I alluded earlier.
16,"As Europe is in the latter part of its trading day when U.S. markets open, this extra demand for dollars at times led the federal funds rate to open well above the target."
17,Loans through the discount window differ from open market operations in that they can be made directly to specific banks with strong demands for liquidity.
18,"The Federal Reserve also took some other steps in response to strains in financial markets, including reducing the fee that it charges for lending Treasury securities from its portfolio, thus helping to meet the heavy demands in the market for those securities."
19,"Consequently, in highly stressed financial conditions, when the marketwide demand for liquidity rises sharply, one of two things must happen: Either the central bank provides the liquidity demanded by lending against good collateral, or forced sales of illiquid assets will drive the prices of those assets well below their longer-term fundamental values, raising the risk of widespread insolvency and intensifying the crisis."

27,"Financial markets overall had improved somewhat, but tighter terms and standards in the mortgage market--particularly in the nonprime and jumbo segments--appeared likely to intensify the correction in housing significantly, with adverse implications for construction activity and house prices."
28,A further sharp contraction in residential construction seemed likely to hold down overall economic growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2008.
29,Strong growth abroad was also viewed as supporting U.S. exports and domestic production.
30,"And as I have noted, the available evidence suggested that overall economic growth in the third quarter remained moderate."
31,"Notably, the weak housing market, somewhat downbeat consumer sentiment, and slower growth in private-sector employment increased the likelihood that consumption spending would slow in coming quarters."
32,"Regarding the other half of its mandate, to promote price stability, the Committee noted some improvement over the past year in measures of the trend component of inflation, such as core inflation."
33,"Moreover, slower growth in aggregate demand would help to ease pressure on resources."
34,"But inflation risks remained, including still-high levels of resource utilization and elevated prices for oil and other commodities."
35,The Committee agreed that continued close attention to inflation developments was warranted.
36,"As most of the meeting participants saw growth likely to run below trend for a while and with the incoming inflation data on the favorable side, the risks to inflation from this action seemed acceptable, especially as the Committee was prepared to reverse the policy easing if inflation pressures proved stronger than expected."
37,The further contraction in housing is likely to be a significant drag on growth in the current quarter and through early next year.
38,We will be following indicators of household and business spending closely as we update our outlook for near-term growth.
39,"The evolution of employment and labor income also will bear watching, as gains in real income support consumer spending even if the weakness in house prices adversely affects homeowners' equity."
