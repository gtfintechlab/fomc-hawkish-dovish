0,"Similarly, the revival in growth that our economy has enjoyed since the middle of last year has also shown up, to greater and lesser degrees, in other parts of the world."
1,"Although growth rates in different regions of the global economy are somewhat synchronous, such shared movements in output do not ensure that external deficits or surpluses will remain small."
2,"With the United States now running a current account deficit equal to about 5 percent of the gross domestic product, the rest of the world must run a correspondingly large net current account surplus."
3,"And when the U.S. deficit starts to decline, then trade flows abroad will adjust as well, reducing their overall surplus."

9,Labor productivity in the United States accelerated to a rate of about 3 percent in the period 1996-2003.
10,These capital inflows exerted upward pressure on the dollar and provided the financing for our widening current account deficit.
11,How long can the current account deficit be sustained?
12,To say that a current account deficit is unsurprising or explainable is not to say that it is sustainable in the long run.
13,"With the net external debt of the United States rising more rapidly than GDP, some narrowing of the deficit is inevitable."
14,"However, such shrinkage does not mean that the current account deficit will be eliminated."
15,"Moreover, to say that the current account deficit cannot stay large on a permanent basis is not to say just when or how adjustment will occur."
16,"In Europe, for example, a considerable expansion in the use of information technologies in recent years has not, to date, appreciably boosted growth rates of labor productivity."

19,"And in Asia, a revival of domestic demand could give the authorities confidence that, if they allow capital inflows to strengthen their currencies and narrow their current account surpluses, high rates of economic growth will be maintained."
20,"Even if rival sources of demand for global capital do not emerge, another factor that would induce adjustment of the current account, if it were to occur, would be a diminishing appetite for additional U.S. assets and, therefore, a reduced willingness to finance the deficit."
21,"From the standpoint of investor portfolios, notwithstanding years of large current account deficits, the share of U.S. equities in global equities actually fell from 49 percent in 1997 to 47 percent in 2002; the U.S. share in the global bond market moved up only marginally during the same period, from 42 percent to 44 percent."

26,"First, a fall of U.S. prices below foreign prices could raise our competitiveness."
27,"Prices have become relatively stable, by historical standards, in the United States and its trading partners, however, and, it is not clear how much of a dent this could put in the trade deficit."
28,A second possibility is that an increase of foreign growth above U.S. growth could boost our exports.
29,"Between 1970 and 1995, foreign GDP growth, weighted by U.S. trade, exceeded U.S. growth by nearly 2/3 percentage point annually; since then, U.S. growth has exceeded foreign growth by 1/4 percentage point."

32,"I must emphasize that, no matter how the U.S. external imbalance is narrowed, the level and composition of demand, both in the United States and abroad, would have to change."
33,"Such a change, in turn, would require adjustments of relative prices."
34,"In the United States, to accommodate increases in exports relative to imports, changes in relative prices would be needed to shift production toward internationally traded goods and services and to shift consumption toward nontraded goods and services."
35,"By the same token, adjustment by our trading partners to a reduction in the U.S. current account deficit would require both an increased domestic demand to maintain the overall level of economic activity and an adjustment of relative prices to raise the share of nontraded goods in production and of traded goods in consumption."

38,"For example, the rise in foreign productivity growth that I touched on earlier could work through several channels to narrow the U.S. trade deficit as funds were attracted abroad."
39,"Strong domestic demand among our trading partners would likely outweigh any drag resulting from appreciation of their currencies, while U.S. exports would benefit from both a change in relative prices and stronger foreign growth."
40,"Of course, the financial press frequently points to less-favorable scenarios, including the so-called disorderly correction, that is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in U.S. bond and equity prices and that perhaps disrupts other national markets as well."
