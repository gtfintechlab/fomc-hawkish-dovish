0,The second is our burgeoning trade and current account deficits and the possibility that they cannot be sustained at these levels.
1,"The increase in our current account deficit has numerous roots, including, most prominently, stronger growth here than in our trading partners."
2,But trade and exchange rate relationships with emerging-market economies are a small part of the story.
3,"The deficit does mean that the United States has been spending more than we produce, and the rest of the world has done the opposite."
4,"We cannot affect the pace of job restructuring nor correct the current account deficit, and that limitation is important to understand."
5,"Nonetheless, how these phenomena evolve and how they are addressed are critical background factors for us as we conduct monetary policy."
6,They can influence the balance of aggregate supply and demand and the functioning of the economy--its flexibility and resiliency and its capacity to advance standards of living.
7,The major increase in global productivity has two main causes.
8,"We can see the effects of technological change here at home, where it has considerably boosted the growth rate of productivity since the mid-1990s."
9,"As workers shift to higher value-added employment, real wages will rise commensurately."
10,Long-run levels of employment are determined by the available supply of labor and the flexibility of the labor market.
11,"Keeping employment reasonably close to its long-term, sustainable level is the job of macroeconomic policy--especially monetary policy."
12,"One study finds that, since the early 1980s, job loss has had a much larger structural component; another study fails to find any such trend.1 Manufacturing employment has been in a long-term downtrend for decades, likely because of the substantial advances in productivity as well as the rising preference for services in an increasingly wealthy country."
13,These developments did not prevent a drop in the unemployment rate to a thirty-year low in the late 1990s.
14,"Higher productivity growth has meant that, on average, real wages and compensation rose substantially in the second half of the 1990s and have continued to increase in the past few years, albeit more slowly, despite the recent recession and jobless recovery."
15,"A lot of today's pain in manufacturing and in the overall economy is cyclical--a consequence of inadequate demand, not of a shift of jobs to other countries."
16,"In fact, until the economy comes much closer to full employment, we will not be able to isolate the structural issues with any confidence."
17,"Authorities here and abroad have the tools to get economies back to high levels of employment and production, even as we adjust to higher productivity growth and shifting production processes."
18,"Indeed, over time, high productivity growth here and rising productive capacity abroad can increase demand for goods and services even more than they increase supply."
19,"We saw considerable strength in demand in the United States in the 1990s, when productivity accelerated, and we are beginning to see it in China, where rising demand for imports is eroding the country's large trade surplus and boosting the economies of some of its trading partners."
20,"We must do a better job of giving our current workers and the next generations the skills needed to grab the highly productive, knowledge-based jobs to which demand will continue to shift."
21,"The Trade and Current Account Deficits Our current account deficit has been growing both in dollar terms and relative to the size of our economy, reaching 5 percent of GDP last year."
22,"This is a record for us; when the deficit approached this magnitude in the past, markets had generally already begun to adjust to reduce it.2 The deficit reflects the fact that spending in the United States exceeds what we produce."
23,We meet the extra demand by importing more than we export.
24,"The strong demand for dollar assets was evidenced by a rising exchange rate, which in turn fed the increase in the current account and trade deficits."
25,"We did not seek to run a current account deficit, nor did we make policy mistakes that brought it on."
26,"The current account and trade deficits became so large mostly because we had a more-dynamic, faster-growing economy than everyone else had--one with a higher expected return on investment, which induced a rising demand for dollar claims on our increasingly productive capital stock."
27,"With the current account deficit climbing, that gap is growing fast--evidently faster than the appetite for U.S. assets."
28,"Governments--especially those of Japan and China--have taken up the slack by purchasing U.S. assets, but the shortfall in the desire to supply savings to fund our deficit has been reflected in a significant drop in the dollar on foreign exchange markets since early 2002."
29,"It is to be expected, at least for economies with exchange rates that truly float, that a shortfall of demand for a country's assets will be reflected at first primarily in the exchange rate."
30,"The lower exchange rate in turn stimulates exports and damps imports, and so the current account deficit and the associated need for foreign capital are also reduced, matching the lower appetite of foreign investors."
31,"They help boost U.S. production to more fully utilize labor and capital and should not add to sustained inflation pressures, even with import prices moving a little higher and competitive pressure on import-competing industries easing a bit."
32,"Some have feared that lagging demand for our assets would show up in lower prices for the assets themselves--that is, in increases in bond yields and declines in equity prices--as well as in lower exchange rates."
33,"However, for the most part, these assets are traded in highly liquid markets, where even large decreases in demand can be accommodated with very small changes in prices."
34,"In such markets, interest rates and equity prices tend to reflect investors' perceptions of fundamentals such as expected inflation, profits, risk, and real growth."
35,"In fact, over recent months, as the dollar has continued to drop, equity prices have risen, and yields on corporate bonds are unchanged to a little lower."
36,"If investors are reaching a point at which assets denominated in U.S. dollars are becoming as large a share of their portfolios as they see appropriate, our trade deficit will need to shrink."
37,"At the Federal Reserve we will continue to work to foster a full employment level of production, one as high as the economy can generate on a sustainable, noninflationary basis."
38,"Relative to that level of production, demand or spending in the United States will need to be considerably more restrained on both domestic and foreign goods, and more U.S. production will need to be exported abroad."
39,This fact--this implication of the simple arithmetic of smaller trade and current account deficits--raises important policy questions for both the United States and the rest of the world.
40,"In that context, the prospect of large federal government deficits stretching out into the future looks worrisome."
41,"If the fiscal path does not change, unless private savings rise considerably to compensate, interest rates will be higher than they otherwise would be to ration the scarcer savings, and we will have slower growth in the capital stock and in the number of houses and autos."
42,Slower growth in the capital stock means slower growth in productivity and in our economic potential.
43,"Constraints on trend growth would be a concern at any time, but they are especially so over the coming years."
44,This is not a task for monetary policy.
45,"In the long run, monetary policy cannot do anything about the current account deficit or about the lack of savings from government policy or private choices."
46,Our manipulation of the overnight interest rate helps to keep the overall economy in balance--promoting price stability and production at the economy's potential.
47,"If our trade and current account deficits move toward balance, foreign economies will face the questions of how to replace the demand that will no longer be coming from the United States and to reallocate production to a new mix of spending."
48,"The United States has been, in effect, exporting its demand overseas, supporting economic activity in foreign economies by importing more goods and services than we export."
49,"As our domestic demand is restrained relative to production, demand elsewhere will have to increase to foster global high employment."
50,"How that is to be achieved is an open question: Structural reforms that improve the flexibility of the labor force and production and that foster growth abroad are a desirable way to contribute to better global balance, but macroeconomic policy adjustments to promote more domestic demand may also be required."
51,"The development strategies of countries such as China and other Asian nations, to be successful, must be compatible with the pattern of adjustment in global demand that is required by the consumption, saving, and investment decisions made by market participants everywhere."
