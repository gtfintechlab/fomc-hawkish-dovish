0,"Today, I would like to talk to you primarily about developments in the residential real estate market since the start of pandemic and then look ahead at the outlook for housing.1 I will consider how rental and home prices have increased and how monetary and fiscal policy have affected these prices."
1,"As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I watch real estate trends pretty closely because they have a bearing on our pursuit of maximum employment and price stability."
2,Real estate also matters for inflation.
3,"Housing services represent about 15 percent of the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, and it represents an even larger share of another well-known inflation yardstick, the Consumer Price Index."
4,"Both house prices and rents are up significantly across the nation, while vacancy rates for rented and owner-occupied homes are down."
5,"Let's start with rents, because rents give us the most direct information on how affordable housing services are.2 Early in the pandemic, rent growth slowed as demand dropped to live in dense areas where rental housing tends to be concentrated while some people, especially young adults, moved in with family and friends."
6,"On net, rents have risen 6.5 percent since January 2020, according to the prices tracked under the Consumer Price Index (CPI)."
7,"Based on various measures of asking rents, some recent research suggests that the rate of rent inflation in the CPI will double in 2022.3 If so, rent as a component of inflation will accelerate, which has implications for monetary policy."
8,"House prices are up a cumulative 35 percent since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Zillow Home Value Index."
9,"Looking over the past two years, one would think the large increase in home prices would have made it more difficult for renters to become first-time buyers."
10,"It could be that time spent at home during the pandemic made renters more interested in owning a home, or that people are getting help from family or friends with down payments, or that some people are choosing to buy smaller homes than they would have a few years ago when prices were lower."
11,Monetary policy actions have had a noticeable effect on mortgage rates.
12,"This setting and forward guidance on the target range put downward pressure on both shorter and longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates."
13,"Research shows that the marginal effect of the agency MBS purchases in response to the COVID shock lowered mortgage rates about 40 basis points.4 On net, rates for 30-year mortgages fell about 1 percentage point from January 2020 to January 2021, which helped dampen the costs of rising house prices over that period."
14,"Specifically, communications at the end of 2021 indicated that, with substantial recovery of the economy and elevated inflation, monetary policy accommodation would begin to unwind."
15,"So, while lower rates may have made home purchases a bit more affordable early in the pandemic, the more recent rebound in mortgage rates and the continued rise in prices have made home purchases less affordable for many people."
16,Economics tells us that some combination of growing demand and limits on housing supply has driven this change.
17,Demand for housing space has been especially strong during the pandemic.
18,"Lockdowns as well as remote work and school may have spurred people to seek homes with more space, leading to an increase in demand for larger and otherwise better homes.5 In fact, the average size of new single-family homes increased in 2021, reversing a downward trend from 2015 through 2020."
19,"In January, this spending was 42 percent higher than the average for 2019, and even after adjustment for the sharp increase in the price of building materials, it was still up 19 percent."
20,"Meanwhile, changes in household formation may have been contributing to increases in housing demand over the past year or so."
21,"The pandemic-related changes in demand for housing, rented and owned, coincided with a longer-run increase in demand to live in certain parts of the country."
22,"For the past several decades, demand for living in cities with high-paying jobs and many urban amenities has surged, pushing up housing costs in these areas."
23,"Among metro areas in the top quartile of local housing demand, population increased 80 percent, and single-family home prices rose more than 110 percent from 1990 to 2019 after adjusting for inflation.6 For the nation as a whole, population only increased 32 percent and house prices rose 59 percent."
24,"While this trend towards urban living supported commercial real estate demand and prices for years, post pandemic, more people are working at home and there has been a corresponding decline in demand for office space, particularly in downtown areas."
25,That's the demand side.
26,"One estimate is that the current growth in the supply of new housing units is about 100,000 less per year that would be needed to support trend increases in demand from household formation and replacement of depreciating units.7 Supply adjusts to changes in the economy more slowly than demand because of the time it takes to plan and build."
27,These supply shortages contributed to skyrocketing input prices.
28,"In January 2022, lumber prices included in the Producer Price Index were 92 percent higher than the 2019 average."
29,"Even with increased materials costs, suppliers have been unable to keep up with demand."
30,"Probably not by accident, these regulations have tended to be more restrictive in areas with high housing demand."
31,"While some local regulations have been changed to allow more housing construction in high demand areas, the effects will take time, and it remains to be seen whether the increases in supply created by these regulatory changes will be enough to satisfy local demand."
32,"I've mentioned the impact of monetary policy on housing markets, now let me touch on the role of fiscal policy."
33,"The rescue plan passed by the Congress in 2020, consisting of stimulus payments, grants to small businesses to maintain their payrolls, and supplemental unemployment benefits, surely helped many people who lost income during the pandemic continue to pay their rent and mortgages."
34,An important question I will keep my eye on is whether the sharp and ongoing increase in home prices poses risks to financial stability.
35,"My short answer is that unlike the housing bubble and crash of mid 2000s, the recent increase seems to be sustained by the substantive supply and demand issues I have detailedâ€”not by excessive leverage, looser underwriting standards, or financial speculation."
36,"In fact, mortgage borrowers entered the pandemic with stronger balance sheets than in the mid 2000s and are therefore better prepared to handle a drop in home prices than they were in the last housing downturn."
37,"In last year's stress test, which featured a severe global recession that included a decline in home prices of over 20 percent, we projected the largest banks could collectively maintain capital ratios at more than double their minimum requirementsâ€”even after withstanding more than $470 billion in losses."
38,I am hopeful that at least some of the pandemic-specific factors pushing up home prices and rents could begin to ease in the next year or so.
39,"The demand for extra space at home might level off, or even reverse if people start to spend more time away from home again as the pandemic eases."
40,"That said, input prices continue to rise, with lumber prices increasing past their eye-popping 2020 peak, even with much more supply."
41,"Longer term, many issues will continue to put upward pressure on home prices and rents."
42,The strong demand to live in cities with tight housing supply is likely to continue.
43,"Regulatory supply constraints may be starting to ease in some places, but they will persist and continue to limit home building in many high demand areas."
44,"And while prices for lumber and other materials may come down, with the economy already at maximum employment and experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, labor supply will likely continue to hold back the pace of new construction."
45,"With housing costs gaining an ever-larger weight in the inflation Americans experience, I will be looking even more closely at real estate to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
