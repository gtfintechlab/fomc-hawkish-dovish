0,"London, home to one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing and much admired financial centers, represents a most appropriate venue to discuss these changes.1 During the past few decades--particularly the last few years--we have witnessed an escalating supply of new financial instruments scarcely able to match surging demand."
1,"And with the benefit of ample liquidity, which I described in previous remarks as broadly equal to confidence, financial products quickly found deep markets, ensuring robust trading.2 Indeed, liquidity-fueled innovation has made markets substantially more â€œcompleteâ€--that is, more risks are more readily priced and traded without significant diminution in value than in prior periods.3 The concept of â€œcomplete marketsâ€ is, in my view, a useful, aspirational, and theoretical construct, even though perfectly complete markets, in which every agent is able to costlessly trade claims on every state of the world, represents an unachievable goal."
2,"The history of financial intermediation, thus, is the story of individual types of institutions--FDIC-insured commercial banks, SEC-registered broker dealers, Federal Reserve-supervised holding companies, just to name a few--adapting their products and practices to meet customer demands."
3,They raise funds primarily by issuing demand deposits.
4,"In addition, use of derivative products has soared; the notional amount of interest rate swaps and options has tripled in the past four years to nearly $300 trillion."
5,"As I have discussed in prior remarks, â€œliquidityâ€ in the sense of â€œtrading liquidityâ€ reflects the ability to transact quickly without exerting a material effect on prices."
6,"Underlying this concept is the fact that although the many buyers and sellers have different views on the most likely outcomes, the distributions of possible outcomes for which they demand risk-based compensation can be quantified."
7,Many economies have achieved a marked reduction in the volatility of real output and core inflation in the past twenty years or so.
8,"Liquidity can flourish if investors interpret strong performance to mean that future economic outcomes will be benign and that â€œtailâ€ realizations are either highly improbable or, at the very least, quantifiable and, hence, can be traded upon.6 There is little doubt, then, that liquidity in most financial markets is high today and that investors seem willing to take risks, even at todayâ€™s market-prevailing prices."
9,"In the United States, term premiums on long-term Treasury yields are very low, corporate bonds appear to be nearly â€œpriced for perfection,â€ and stock prices are setting new records."
10,"These prices, terms and credit conditions may reflect solid economic fundamentals--low output and inflation uncertainty, healthy corporate balance sheets, and corporate profits that exceed market expectations--and if so, they may help to ease the effects of fluctuations in liquidity should they occur."
11,"The prices and conditions may also reflect increased appetite for risk; or, far less auspiciously, they may be indicative of investor overconfidence."
12,"The Brave New World: More Complete Markets and Conflating Roles The powerful combination of liquidity and financial innovation has made markets seemingly more complete--that is, more risks are priced and traded without undue penalty owing to their unique nature or shallowness of the relevant financial market."
13,"Well, consider the consequence if stock prices sold off globally, implied volatility jumped, and record trading volumes overwhelmed the trading capacity on the stock exchanges."
14,"Then, reflect on the likely divergence of opinions on the possible causes of such a rapid change in sentimentâ€‘â€‘perhaps it was a freefall in stock prices in a growing emerging-market economy, or escalating concerns about lending standards in some markets, or rapidly changing animal spirits eroding investor confidence."
15,"As you all know, share prices quickly recovered, and implied volatility reverted to near-record low levels."
16,"In the recent episode, opportunistic capital apparently viewed large movements in asset prices as trading opportunities."
17,"The knowledge of how to bundle, distribute, and price risk cannot be erased from our collective memories."
18,The growth of competing financial centers around the globe is testament to the enduring power of financial innovation and the dynamism of financial intermediaries.
19,"Perhaps, then, we should consider the growth in financial innovation as being analogous to Mooreâ€™s Law, which has for more than a generation accurately predicted the growth in computing power of a transistor at constant cost.7 Neither Mooreâ€™s Law nor the development of new financial products is a mathematical or physical certainty based on some geometric extrapolation or law of the universe."
