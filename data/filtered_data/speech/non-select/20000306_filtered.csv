0,"Not only has the expansion achieved record length, but it has done so with economic growth far stronger than expected."
1,"Most remarkably, inflation has remained largely subdued in the face of labor markets tighter than any we have experienced in a generation."
2,A key factor behind this extremely favorable performance has been the resurgence in productivity growth.
3,"Indeed, the rate of growth appears to have been rising throughout the period."
4,"The exceptional stock price volatility of these newer firms and, in the view of some, their outsized valuations indicate the difficulty of divining the particular technologies and business models that will prevail in the decades ahead."
5,"Although these instruments cannot reduce the risk inherent in real assets, they can redistribute it in a way that induces more investment in real assets and, hence, engenders higher productivity and standards of living."
6,"Technological synergies have enlarged the set of productive capital investments, while lofty equity values and declining prices of high-tech equipment have reduced the cost of capital."
7,"The result has been a veritable explosion of spending on high-tech equipment and software, which has raised the growth of the capital stock dramatically over the past five years."
8,"The fact that the capital spending boom is still going strong indicates that businesses continue to find a wide array of potential high-rate-of-return, productivity-enhancing investments."
9,"Indeed, many argue that the pace of innovation will continue to quicken in the next few years, as companies exploit the still largely untapped potential for e-commerce, especially in the business-to-business arena, where most observers expect the fastest growth."
10,"As I testified before the Congress last month, accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output."
11,The pickup in productivity however tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply.
12,"This occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth, not surprisingly, fosters higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings."
13,"These higher expectations, in turn, not only spur business investment but also increase stock prices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced."
14,"Moreover, higher stock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capital spending."
15,"Outlays prompted by capital gains in equities and homes in excess of increases in income, as best we can judge, have added about 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, on average, over the past half-decade."
16,"The additional growth in spending of recent years that has accompanied these wealth gains, as well as other supporting influences on the economy, appears to have been met in equal measure by increased net imports and by goods and services produced by the net increase in newly hired workers over and above the normal growth of the workforce, including a substantial net inflow of workers from abroad."
17,But these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments to purchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb indefinitely an excess of demand over supply.
18,"Growing net imports and a widening current account deficit require ever-larger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the United States, an outcome that cannot continue without limit."
19,Imbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for potential inflation pressures.
20,"At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity."
21,"This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end."
22,"In short, unless we are able to indefinitely increase the rate of capital flows into the United States to finance rising net imports or continuously augment immigration quotas, overall demand for goods and services cannot chronically exceed the underlying growth rate of supply."
23,Our immediate goal at the Federal Reserve should be to encourage the economic and financial conditions that will best foster the technological innovation and investment that spur structural productivity growth.
24,It is structural productivity growth--not the temporary rise and fall of output per hour associated with various stages of the business cycle--that determines how rapidly living standards rise over time.
25,Achievement of this goal requires a stable macroeconomic environment of sustained growth and continued low inflation.
26,"That, in turn, means that the expansion of demand must moderate into alignment with the more rapid growth rate of potential supply."
27,"The current gap between the growth of supply and demand for goods and services, of necessity, has been reflected in an excess in the demand for funds over new savings from Americans, including those savings generated by rising budget surpluses."
28,"If so, the wealth effect adding to spending growth would eventually be damped, and both the rate of increase in net imports as a share of GDP, and the rate of decline in the pool of unemployed workers willing to work should also slow."
29,"However, so long as these two imbalances continue, reflecting the excess of demand over supply, the level of potential workers will continue to fall and the net debt to foreigners will continue to rise by increasing amounts."
30,"Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve, effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply, the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability."
31,They could not alter the eventual shifts in production that owe to enormous changes in relative prices across the economy.
