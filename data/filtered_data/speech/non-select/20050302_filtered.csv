0,"They are supposed to look past any superficial good news and try to discern longer-run problems--perhaps inflation heating up, perhaps something else."
1,The Blue Chip survey of leading business forecasters predicts that the growth of real gross domestic product will average 3.5 percent over the next two years and that unemployment rates will decline slightly.
2,"Unemployment rates are near their normal, or equilibrium, level, yet these forecasters still look for basic stability in core inflation rates."
3,"According to the Blue Chip survey, investment should grow at healthy rates, and productivity growth should remain strong."
4,"In these forecasts, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising short-term interest rates toward their equilibrium level."
5,"When economic data are released, there is always a great deal of attention to overall output, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and budget and trade deficits."
6,"I begin with a simple identity, taken from the national income accounts: NS = S - BD = I - B The left side of this identity covers the sources of national saving (NS), which are private saving in the economy (S) less budget deficits (BD)."
7,Budget deficits are subtracted because budget deficits imply that private saving is in part going to pay for the deficits of the government and not going into private investment.
8,"This is the spending that raises productivity and output in the long run, and for that reason it is of special interest."
9,"This is done by deducting B, essentially the nation's current account deficit (through another accounting identity of which I will spare you discussion)."
10,"In the short-run, international borrowing can go up or down depending on cyclical movements, exchange rates, and a host of other factors."
11,"A further value in writing out the identity is to tie all this to budget and current account deficits, which are the focus of much popular discussion."
12,"In a word, both deficits are subtraction items."
13,"Budget deficits reduce national saving by, as I said earlier, siphoning off some private saving to pay for government deficits."
14,Current account deficits can be associated with low national saving if a nation borrows to finance its investment.
15,"Some economists talk about a ""twin deficit"" scenario in which budget deficits lead to current account deficits of exactly the same size."
16,But it is also possible to imagine many scenarios in which budget and current account deficits move independently.
17,"These deficits are certainly linked through their impact on national saving, but they are not twins."
18,"The former is bad from the standpoint of future productivity, the latter is likely not sustainable."
19,"Sources Side National saving has dropped because private saving rates have dropped, especially those for households.2 Moreover, in recent years federal budget deficits have shot up."
20,"From a national saving point of view, the rise in deficits would not be particularly alarming if private saving rates were high, nor would the decline in private saving rates be particularly alarming if the budget were in surplus."
21,But the combination of low private saving rates and deficits can lead to problems.
22,"While there are ways to influence private saving rates by policy measures, changes in national saving for the most part follow changes in fiscal policy.3 Figure 2 shows the historical path for fiscal policy, specifically the federal deficit (in effect consigning state and local governments to the private sector)."
23,"The dotted line shows the primary deficit, which is the total federal deficit less interest payments, as a share of GDP."
24,"To stabilize the ratio of the stock of federal debt to GDP, this primary deficit should be kept close to zero.4 The solid line gives just this federal debt to GDP ratio."
25,When viewed in a historical context the federal deficit picture does not look particularly troubling.
26,"The primary deficit ratio has cycled around zero, and the debt-GDP ratio has cycled between 25 and 50 percent."
27,"But that brief period of good fortune has passed; primary deficits are back, and the debt-GDP ratio is rising again."
28,"One of their scenarios took the so-called baseline budget, added in likely military spending for Iraq and Afghanistan, extended the recently enacted tax cuts, and adjusted the alternative minimum tax for inflation.5 Under these assumptions, the recent turn for the worse is likely to be reversed only slowly."
29,"The primary deficit averages around 2 percent of GDP for the next few years before gradually shrinking, and the debt-GDP ratio climbs back to about 45 percent by 2015."
30,These essentially reduce or eliminate the taxation of interest income and hence provide a price inducement for households to save more.
31,"On the other side, IRAs entail a federal revenue loss and a rise in deficits."
32,"Since national saving is defined as private saving less deficits, the larger deficits can actually make national saving decline in response to a measure that purports to increase national saving."
33,"Uses Side We have seen that national saving is likely to continue to be low, the result of a combination of low personal saving in the presence of possibly persisting budget deficits."
34,"As was mentioned, this sets up a difficult quandary--either investment will have to decrease, lowering future productivity, or international borrowing will have to continue at high levels, raising international liability ratios."
35,"The historical record for the United States, presented in a form similar to that for budget deficits, is shown in figure 3."
36,"Again, the dotted line is the primary deficit ratio, which in the case of international accounts is just the trade deficit."
37,"But since 1990 the United States has embarked on a long-term period of high trade deficits, and now the international liability rate is close to 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply."
38,"The international deficit that determines the growth or decline in a country's international liability ratio is the trade deficit, and there are few cases of countries running large-scale trade deficits for more than four or five years."
39,"In line with this record, many authors have been predicting for some time that the combination of interest rates, income, prices, and exchange rates would adjust to end the U.S. trade deficits.8 But the deficits have not ended, and international economists are searching for reasons to explain the situation."
40,"Under this view, which has been labeled the ""co-dependency"" view, the United States is permitted to overconsume through the combination of its inability to cut budget deficits and its unwillingness to save much privately."
41,"Largely because of the productivity revolution here, these countries have been able to get better returns on their assets in this country than in their own, and they have been putting great quantities of saving in world capital markets, perhaps explaining the present low level of world long-term real interest rates."
42,"A third possibility is that the so-called ""home bias"" in international saving-investment choices is gradually eroding.10 In this view, globalization has generally reduced the barriers to international asset diversification, and we are witnessing a rebalancing of wealth portfolios which, in the transition, can lead to persisting current account deficits or surpluses."
43,"Under such an approach, which I will term co-independence, the United States would gradually cut its budget deficit."
44,Doing so would reduce aggregate demand and hence require other changes to preserve full employment.
45,"One of the key mandates of the Federal Reserve is to preserve sustainable employment levels, and the Fed certainly could do that."
46,"And to the extent that foreign net exports might decline as the United States cut its own trade deficits, foreign countries may need to stimulate their own economies, which they could do with some combination of monetary and fiscal policy."
47,The result would be to preserve full employment around the world but with reduced capital account imbalances.
48,"In the short run, output growth is healthy and inflation rates are stable."
