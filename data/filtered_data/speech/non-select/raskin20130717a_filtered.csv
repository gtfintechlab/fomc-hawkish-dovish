0,"Today, I want to discuss regulatory policies in the context of the growth and inevitable collapse of asset bubbles, with a focus on the role of credit.Regulatory policies, when well crafted, can lean against credit excesses that result in asset bubbles."
1,"In so doing, they can lean against vulnerabilities in the financial system that encourage the growth of excess credit."
2,"And, to approximate current economic conditions, we'll assume an environment of interest rates that have been low, and continue to be low, for a long time."
3,"If many investors employ this strategy and they borrow to invest in the same asset, the price of that asset, and perhaps the prices of closely related assets as well, will increase noticeably faster than the historical trend."
4,"At the same time, increased demand for credit to finance these asset purchases could lead lenders to increase their reliance on less expensive, unstable short-term funding, such as uninsured deposits, commercial paper, or repo transactions, in order to fund the loans."
5,"Besides meeting customers' growing demands for credit, financial intermediaries may themselves decide to ""reach for yield"" and take on additional risk in a low interest-rate environment."
6,"Banks suffering compressed net interest margins because of low long-term interest rates, money market funds facing an earnings squeeze, insurance companies that had promised minimum rates of return on their products, and others may all begin to take on higher interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk, or credit risk in search of higher returns."
7,"If these conditions seem likely to continue, an initial rise in the asset's price leads to expectations of further increases, which adds to investor demand, spurring further borrowing and credit growth and increased household and financial sector leverage, which, in turn, could drive asset prices still higher."
8,"Rising asset prices, in turn, would increase the value of borrowers' collateral, allowing still further borrowing."
9,"For loans collateralized by an asset whose price is rising, lenders believe they can rely for repayment more on the appreciation of the asset and collateral and less on the borrower's repayment ability."
10,"To compete for loans to buy or to hold the appreciating asset, or financial assets related to it, financial institutions could also decrease the margins and haircuts that usually protect them from asset price declines."
11,"Financial institution decisions to relax underwriting and impose less-stringent margins and haircuts will further increase the pool of potential borrowers and their borrowing capacity, further increasing credit growth and supporting still higher asset prices, but, at the same time, will also increase lenders' credit risks and exposure--as secured creditors--to a decline in the asset's price."
12,"Ultimately, the asset becomes severely overvalued, with its price untethered from economic fundamentals."
13,"And, as we experienced in the financial crisis, when a bubble involving a widely-held asset bursts, the consequent plunge in asset prices can seriously impair the balance sheets of households and firms."
14,"Indeed, a dramatic decline in the price of a significant asset can reduce household wealth, spending, and aggregate demand."
15,"When such effects on wealth, credit availability, and aggregate demand are large enough, the real economy can suffer a significant recession."
16,"And, of course, lower employment and incomes further depress asset prices and borrowers' ability to repay loans, with further adverse effects on financial institutions and their ability to extend credit."
17,"Such a loss of confidence, in turn, makes it impossible for affected institutions to roll over existing debts or extend new credit, and may force deleveraging that requires selling illiquid assets quickly and cheaply in asset fire sales, resulting in further declines in asset prices."
18,"Home prices rose dramatically for a decade, and then plunged more than 30 percent, throwing the financial system into chaos, severely contracting credit, and triggering the most severe recession in modern memory."
19,"And asset bubbles are characterized by many investors chasing the same asset, and so there is generally wide-spread participation in the growth and nurturing of the bubble."
20,But it is my view that asset bubbles are a feature of our financial landscape; that what happened before could happen again; and that the growth and after-effects of asset bubbles reflect particular financial institution decisions and particular regulatory policy choices or lapses.
21,"Responding to Asset Price Bubbles The good news is that I believe that regulatory policy, when part of a system of effective prudential supervision, has the potential to address asset price bubbles and their consequences."
22,"In addition, such policies can build resilience in the financial system, enhancing its ability to absorb and shrug off unexpected losses from any source, including sharp asset price declines."
23,"Of course, monetary policy also has the power to lean against the growth of asset bubbles."
24,"While there could be situations in which monetary policy might be needed to try to limit the growth of a bubble, in my opinion such use would represent a failure of regulatory policy, which represents a more tailored response than the flattening out of aggregate demand that would likely result from contractionary monetary policy."
25,"Without plumbing the depths of each type of tool, I'll say a few words about each as it relates to the curbing of excess credit growth that fuels asset bubbles and to mitigating the effects of a bubble's collapse."
26,"Thus, higher capital requirements, to some degree, also lean against excessive credit growth that can fuel asset bubbles."
27,"In that sense, minimum liquidity requirements also lean against building vulnerabilities that could accompany the growth of an asset bubble."
28,"Haircuts tend to be cyclical: falling in good times, which adds to the growth of credit, and rising in busts, which contracts credit."
29,"It could also make it more expensive to fund the purchase of the securities, and so could limit the amount of borrowing that could be supported by an asset of given value; this, in turn, might limit credit-fueled increases in the asset's price."
30,"In other words, by requiring increased margin, the growth of credit can be slowed and resiliency can be strengthened."
31,This would lean against the growth of bubbles even if regulators had not yet discerned the particular type of asset bubble growing.
32,Tighter minimum down payment requirements in good times would likely reduce defaults and build lender resilience to later losses due to asset price declines.
33,"At the same time, by actively leaning progressively harder against property-related credit expansion, they may restrain excessive credit growth and property price appreciation, and reduce the chances--and magnitude--of a sharp price bust."
34,"In Hong Kong, for example, tighter down payment rules reduce household leverage and the sensitivity of defaults to changes in property prices, and have been shown to slow property appreciation."
35,"Regulatory policies that aim to increase the resilience of regulated institutions, and lean against asset bubbles by restraining the growth of lending by such institutions, can be circumvented when financial activities migrate into less regulated parts of the financial system, parts likely farther from the protections of deposit insurance and the lender of last resort."
36,And such a fragmented structure itself demands unusual and extensive degrees of coordination and cooperation among financial regulators so as to maximize the potential for comprehensive and harmonized regulation.
37,"In reality, it is hard to know in real time when asset prices have deviated sharply from fundamentals."
38,Asset price increases often initially reflect improving fundamentals and may only subtly and gradually change into reflections of speculative excess.
39,"Prior to the peak of housing prices, interest rates were low, making mortgage payments affordable; real incomes were rising; population was growing; and household formation was high--all ""fundamental"" determinants of the demand for housing and house prices."
40,"At some point, however, house prices were driven less by these fundamentals and more by speculation and weak underwriting."
41,"Ultimately, this drove house prices to unsustainably high levels."
42,"These reforms will build resilience to whatever shocks may come, and will reduce the potential for asset bubbles and excessive credit growth, leverage, maturity transformation, reliance on unstable short-term wholesale funding, and, thus, the potential for future financial crises."
43,"Only when such tools--be they capital-focused, liquidity-focused, margin--and haircut-focused, or underwriting-focused--are fully embedded into a comprehensive system of prudential regulation will they reach their potential in mitigating the growth of asset bubbles and providing resiliency against the awful consequences attendant to their destruction."
