0,"Private payroll employment has risen a little more than 200,000 per month, on average, since the end of last year, and although last month's increase of 117,000 was disappointing, there is little indication that the labor market's progress is stalling."
1,"The same may be said of the manufacturing sector, in which employment, before last month's decline, had posted three consecutive months of solid gains, and production advanced strongly again in the second quarter."
2,"Of course, as some recent data remind us, there are always sizable uncertainties regarding both the likely rate of growth of economic activity and the trajectory of inflation."
3,A change in business-cycle dynamics might dictate important changes in the conduct of monetary policy.
4,"Business fixed investment usually jumps shortly after a business-cycle trough, as firms that held back during the recession rush to put new equipment in place to replace aging equipment and to meet the expected surge in demand."
5,"Likewise, investment in business inventories, which had subtracted more than 1 percentage point from real GDP growth, on average, during the six quarters leading up to the trough, failed to snap back in its usual fashion."
6,"Similarly, real residential investment continued to expand during the recession, and although the rate of growth was relatively subdued, it bore no resemblance to the sharp declines that characterized every previous recession in the post-World War II period; the acceleration since the upturn began has been relatively subdued as well."
7,"However, the most noted feature of the current recovery is that employment has been below par--another so-called jobless recovery."
8,"Private payroll employment, and the workweek on net, continued to fall for two years from the trough of the recession in late 2001."
9,"Private employment last month remained well below its level when the recession began, and only in May had it climbed above its level when the recession ended."
10,"This situation contrasts sharply with the beginning of most postwar recoveries (although, as I will discuss later, not with the one in the early 1990s), when employment surged."
11,"Similarly, with employment growth until recently having been wanting, the unemployment rate peaked more than a year and a half after the recession ended and has not yet fallen below its level at the time designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the economic trough."
12,"And quite possibly the unemployment rate has been understating the amount of slack in the labor market because labor-force participation has been unusually weak, perhaps reflecting an assessment on the part of many households that job availability would be poor for those actually in the labor market."
13,The output growth that largely defines the recovery resulted from impressive growth in labor productivity.
14,"During the two years of falling employment, productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose about 5 percent per year."
15,"One expects productivity to rise quickly during the early stages of a recovery; as utilization rates rise, companies find more for their workers to do."
16,"Part of the growth of labor productivity may have to do with unusual, and transitory, hesitation on the part of businesses to hire, a topic to which I will return."
17,"Whereas most recessions since World War II had no productivity growth or had outright declines, productivity during this past recession rose at a rate of more than 2 percent."
18,And this growth was a continuation of the rapid gains that characterized the latter half of the 1990s.
19,The favorable performance of productivity likely is related to another unusual feature of this recovery: the behavior of prices.
20,Productivity growth in the years leading up to the business-cycle peak in early 2001 was one factor that contributed to keeping inflation low.
21,Core prices for personal consumption expenditures advanced at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent over the two years preceding the peak--despite unemployment rates down around 4 percent.
22,"Moreover, prices decelerated during the recovery."
23,At this time last year we observed core PCE inflation in the vicinity of 1 percent.
24,"In fact, inflation was so low, especially once known biases in the price indexes are taken into account, that for several months the FOMC was concerned more about the possibility of ""inflation becoming undesirably low"" than about the risk of a rise in inflation."
25,These low rates of inflation coming into the recession and continuing into the recovery were one reason why the Federal Reserve responded so aggressively to the downturn and why we maintained a historically low federal funds rate so long after the trough.
26,"In general, comparing monetary policy responses across cyclical episodes is difficult."
27,"The natural indicator to look at, the federal funds rate, is measured in nominal terms, so that large movements in the rate of inflation can mask the underlying stance of policy."
28,"And given the relatively small decline in output in 2001, one can easily argue that this monetary policy response was unusually aggressive."
29,"For example, the rebound in residential investment fell short of the typical burst in 1961, the unemployment rate remained stubbornly high in 1971, and inventory investment remained low in 1975."
30,"First, employment rose at a glacial pace for a year and a half after the trough in early 1991, and the unemployment rate continued to rise."
31,"The shallowness of the downturns is consistent with the general moderation of the volatility of U.S. economic activity in the past twenty years, which many observers have noted."
32,"However, the recession of 1969-70 was not any deeper, yet investment spending and payroll employment growth shot up immediately after the trough."
33,"For example, perhaps the pace of structural change in the demand for labor has increased over time."
34,"One could point, say, to a smaller proportion of temporary layoffs among job losers during the past two episodes as an indication that re-employment is now more likely to require changing employers than it was in earlier times."
35,"From a firm's perspective, hiring new workers for different jobs rather than recalling former workers to their previous jobs is likely to involve greater up-front costs in terms of recruitment and training, and the shifts in demand that created the need for new workers mean that hiring is associated with new capital as well."
36,"In this case, firms may require greater confidence in the durability of demand for their products to be willing to incur the costs involved in hiring."
37,These developments reduce the up-front costs and commitments involved in hiring and should make firms more willing to hire as demand for their products revives.
38,"In contrast to earlier recessions, which were often sparked by tightening monetary policy, the 1990 recession was triggered by a pullback in aggregate demand not induced by monetary policy."
39,"In 1990, oil prices increased and consumer confidence dropped sharply; both occurrences were at least partly related to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait."
40,"Although the Federal Reserve had tightened policy in the late 1980s to restrain price pressures, it was loosening again by mid-1989."
41,Using monetary policy to counter a shock of this nature is not as straightforward as reversing an earlier tightening.
42,"Indeed, this ""overhang"" of capital has likely contributed to the impressive growth in productivity over the past few years, as businesses have made more and better use of the high-tech equipment they had previously installed but underexploited."
43,"In 1982, for instance, as the United States emerged from recession, growth in the rest of the world was moribund, and the international financial system was considered fragile."
44,Other concerns were that the length of the recession would make consumers and businesses cautious and that changes in the economy would lead to prolonged structural unemployment.
45,"In 1975, concerns were that the recovery would be weak because businesses were still adjusting to higher oil prices and pollution regulations and because several large cities (most famously New York) were having serious financial troubles."
46,"Even after the relatively mild recession of 1969-70, a speculative crisis in foreign exchange markets and apprehensions on the part of businesses about just-enacted wage and price controls and environmental regulations fueled some pessimism about the prospects for a quick recovery."
47,This view implies that monetary policymaking probably does not need to be altered in a systematic way to accommodate a new sort of business-cycle dynamics.
48,"On the contrary, the fact that the two most recent recoveries have involved slow job growth in their initial stages may best be attributed to chance rather than a new structure of the economy."
