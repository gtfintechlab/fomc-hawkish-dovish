0,This stereotype has several elements: Any Fed governor or central banker is an inflation freak who thinks reducing inflation should be the only objective of monetary policy and a zero inflation economy would be heaven.
1,Any central banker has a firm view of exactly what growth rate the economy ought not to exceed and how high the unemployment rate ought to be to avoid inflation -- that something called the NAIRU is engraved on a stone tablet somewhere high on a mountain top and all we have to do is find it.
2,"Moreover, this stereotypical central banker knows exactly what monetary policy ought to be in order to keep the economy on the desired track."
3,I would like to discuss today the primary puzzles that confront those of us in the monetary policymaking arena and then offer a few thoughts about how economists might focus their energies to be helpful in the current and upcoming macroeconomic policy process.
4,I'm not an inflation freak; I'm a growth freak.
5,"We don't benefit from rapid growth spurts that unleash inflation which later has to be reigned in at a high price, just as we don't benefit from growth that damages the environment and creates a need for costly repair."
6,"But we ought to try to be on the highest growth track that is sustainable and stay on it with as few ups and downs as possible, because the downs are so costly, especially in terms of lost opportunity to build human capital."
7,"By the same token, we ought to aim to keep unemployment as low as is sustainable."
8,The benefits of the recent rapid job growth in the U.S. are especially evident by contrast with Europe.
9,French and German unemployment rates have been incredibly high for a long time.
10,"French and German officials speak of their unemployment as ""structural"" and discuss the need to increase job training, improve the functioning of labor markets, and reduce the incentives not to work which are built into their generous benefit systems."
11,It is a lot easier to reduce structural unemployment when the demand for labor is brisk than when it is lagging.
12,"So this central banker believes that the goal of monetary policy, like the goal of fiscal policy, ought to be the highest sustainable growth rate and the lowest sustainable unemployment."
13,"Low inflation should not be thought of as an end in itself, but as a means to an end."
14,"Accelerating inflation has proved a threat to the sustainability of growth, and the self-perpetuating nature of inflation makes it more costly to correct than to avoid."
15,"They said: ""The Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
16,"It would be a mistake to reword the Act, as some have suggested, to give the Fed a single objective -- reducing inflation -- on which to focus monetary policy."
17,It would be especially unfortunate to specify a zero inflation target.
18,"First, because we don't measure inflation well enough to know when we have hit an exact target."
19,"But it is the second part of the central banker stereotype that economists see as most obviously absurd; namely, that the Fed actually controls interest rates and that it knows for sure where the monetary dials ought to be set to achieve a specific growth or unemployment target."
20,"The reality is that the Fed controls -- and rather imperfectly at that -- one extremely short-term interest rate, the fed funds rate."
21,The most that one can say about the Fed's principal monetary policy tool is that we can safely guess the direction of the effect of moving it and that we know there is a considerable lag between the move and the effect; but we cannot specify with any degree of certainty how large the effect is or how long it takes.
22,Any monetary policy move is a judgment call to be made with a great deal of humility because the judgment involves making a guess about what is likely to be happening to economic activity six months to a year or more in advance and whether resources might be underutilized by then or inflationary pressure might be building.
23,"The combination of macro-economic statistics is actually more favorable -- more growth, more employment, less budget deficit, less inflation -- than most people would have guessed possible a year or two ago."
24,What's really going on with prices?
25,"And especially, what's really going on with productivity?"
26,"The labor market puzzle is partly why low unemployment is not leading to more obvious bottlenecks, more serious skill shortages and more rapid increases in compensation than we are in fact experiencing?"
27,It's tempting to believe that the uniformity of unemployment rates around the country indicates that the information age is paying off in better functioning labor markets.
28,"The price puzzle is why prices have been so well behaved in the face of labor costs that have been rising, albeit not especially fast."
29,"Is the ability of firms to absorb labor cost increases without raising prices and without apparent reduction in profit margins confirming the hypothesis that productivity is rising faster than we thought, or faster than the admittedly inadequate data have been telling us?"
30,"Indeed, it is the productivity puzzle that may hold the key to the gratifyingly mysterious behavior of the economy."
31,Economists have thought for some time that the increasing importance of services in the economy is confounding the ability to understand what is happening to both product and productivity.
32,"We observed an increase in manufacturing productivity, but not in service productivity."
33,"Indeed, measured productivity was generally negative in service industries even where anecdotal evidence indicated that processes had been streamlined, products had been substantially improved, as well as greatly proliferated, and the people in the industry believed they were doing a much more effective job serving their customers."
34,Economists also wondered aloud why all the investment in computers and information technology that was so obviously changing the world was not having an impact on productivity.
35,We opined that maybe people weren't using computers very well or that many things people were using computers for -- like editing everything to death or spelling things correctly -- were not actually contributing to productivity at least as we were measuring it.
36,"The Clinton Administration, to its credit, has recognized the need for improving both the concepts and measurement of prices and products and has asked for a modest increase in resources for the statistical agencies in the President's budget, even in the context of general budget cuts."
