2,"The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices."
3,We have invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects your lives and the lives of the people your organizations represent.
4,We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us.
5,"Unemployment is at a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective."
6,"While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challengesâ€”from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates."
7,"While slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, ""What's wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?"""
8,"Low can be good, but when inflationâ€”and, consequently, interest ratesâ€”are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns."
9,"So, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation."
10,"Doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies."
11,"More-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate."
12,We are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes.
13,One clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining this historically strong job market.
