0,The widening of the U.S. trade deficit may have exacerbated concerns about the country's international competitiveness.
1,Arguments for Free TradeInternational trade contributes to prosperity and growth through several channels.
2,"To anyone who has walked into a large discount store and surveyed the range of low-priced items produced in any number of distant economies, this benefit is abundantly clear."
3,"Between 1990 and 2003, for example, the overall consumer price index rose 41 percent, whereas prices declined for many highly traded goods, including toys (whose prices fell 26 percent), televisions (53 percent), and clocks and lamps (15 percent); in just the past five years, the price of telephones, calculators, and other such items has fallen 42 percent."
4,"Yet, we do not know how much of the decline in these prices can be attributed to trade, as most traded products are manufactures and are subject to greater productivity growth (and hence steeper declines in costs) than nontraded products such as services."
5,A more fruitful approach may be to compare the prices of goods that are protected from international competition with what they would be in the absence of such barriers.
6,"A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission indicates that sectoral trade liberalization would lower the price of sugar for U.S. consumers by 8 percent, of apparel by 5 percent, and of footwear and leather products by 4 percent.4 Clearly, if international trade were curtailed for a much broader range of goods, the cost of living for American workers would be higher and the standard of living correspondingly lower."
7,"A recent analysis of the effects of past trade liberalizations on the U.S. economy puts the gains to U.S. welfare at about 1/2 percent of GDP.5 A separate analysis of a hypothetical 33 percent reduction in trade barriers around the world suggests it would raise welfare by 1-1/2 percent of global GDP.6 In addition to promoting specialization, trade boosts productivity through a fourth channel of influence: opening the economy to heightened competition."
8,"This effect could occur either as firms are spurred by foreign competitors to become more efficient, or as the least productive firms are forced to close, thus raising the average level of productivity for the economy as a whole."
9,"By heightening competitive forces and thus incentives for productivity and innovation, international trade has likely accelerated the process of ""creative destruction"" by which outdated and less productive activities are replaced by new technologies and more dynamic enterprises."
10,"Academic research supports the view that import competition has led U.S. manufacturing firms to become more capital intensive;7 trade liberalization apparently has enhanced productivity in some import-competing firms in foreign countries as well.8 Producing for export markets may also yield dividends: Research suggests that exporters are more productive than non-exporters in the same industry and that they grow more rapidly as well.9 Finally, many studies suggest that countries that are more open to international trade have enjoyed higher rates of economic growth.10 Our sad experience after adoption of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, as well as the record of Latin America, India, and other regions that experimented with ""import-substituting industrialization,"" point to the deterioration in economic performance that occurs when countries erect barriers to trade.11 Arguments against Free TradeIf the benefits conferred by international trade are reasonably straightforward, how can we explain the apparent ambivalence toward trade picked up by recent surveys?"
11,"One concern about free trade may be that it has given rise to large trade and current account deficits, thereby adding to the nation's debt and putting future prosperity at risk."
12,"Now at more than 5 percent of GDP, the current account deficit is in record territory, it is growing, and it cannot be sustained indefinitely."
13,"We cannot foresee when the deficit will stop growing and return to more-sustainable levels, through what mechanisms this adjustment will occur, or whether this adjustment will be smooth or disruptive for financial markets and the economy more generally."
14,"No matter how a correction of the external imbalance proceeds, however, it will involve a range of adjustments to investment, saving, and asset prices, both for the U.S. economy and for our trading partners."
15,"Research suggests that past corrections of large external imbalances in industrial countries generally have occurred without crisis.12 Whether or not this will remain the case, I am confident that protectionism is not the appropriate response to our growing current account deficit."
16,"Yet, it is certain that such actions would impose costs on the economy that would persist long after concerns about the deficit dissipated."
17,"A second concern about free trade that is frequently voiced, and probably a more important one to many people, is that trade destroys American jobs and creates unemployment."
18,The first variant holds that the rise in imports lowers employment and raises the unemployment rate by shifting jobs overseas.
19,"However, economywide equilibrating forces, including monetary policy, ensure that over time such employment losses are offset by gains elsewhere in the economy, so that the nationwide unemployment rate averages around its equilibrium level."
20,"In fact, the inflow of foreign capital that finances our trade deficit provides the funding for investment projects that employ U.S. workers just as surely as does any other productive activity in the economy."
21,"Between 1960 and 2003, the trade balance moved from a slight surplus to a deficit of 4-1/2 percent of GDP, and nominal imports rose from about 4 percent of GDP to 14 percent--yet, the current unemployment rate of about 5-1/2 percent is little changed from its 1960 level, while nonfarm private employment has grown by more than 60 million jobs.14 It has also been suggested that import competition has caused a significant portion of the decline in employment since the recession of 2001."
22,"Yet, the ratio of the nominal trade deficit to GDP widened less than 1 percentage point between 2000 and 2003."
23,"It is understandable that concerns about job losses from import competition may extend far beyond their actual incidence in the labor market, given more general anxieties about employment security among American workers."
24,"A final concern about trade that I would like to discuss is that import competition, whether or not it affects the number of jobs, shifts the employment mix from high-quality jobs to low-quality jobs."
25,"Moreover, the declining share of manufacturing in U.S. employment most likely stems less from import competition than it does from the rapid pace of productivity growth in manufacturing; this growth outpaced the productivity growth of the overall economy by about 1-1/4 percentage points annually from 1973 to 1994 and by 1-1/2 percentage points from 1994 to 2000."
26,"The higher rate of productivity growth in manufacturing has restrained both price increases and employment in the sector, thus leading the services area of the economy to expand its share of spending and jobs."
27,"Yet, as in the case of import competition more generally, we must not exaggerate the importance of outsourcing to the nation's overall employment picture."
28,"However, other studies have argued that the rise in skill premiums is attributable to technological developments that have raised relative demands for educated workers."
29,"Some of these fears may be overstated--for example, the claim that imports lower aggregate employment."
30,"For example, in antidumping cases, determining the ""fair value"" of a good may involve a degree of discretion, thereby complicating the assessment of whether foreign goods are being sold below their appropriate price.22 Domestic producers have a strong incentive to lobby for trade actions regardless of whether such actions are merited."
31,"According to one study, the 2002 steel safeguard program contributed to higher steel prices that eliminated about 200,000 jobs in steel-using industries, whereas only 187,500 workers were employed by U.S. steel-producers in December 2002.23 Second, trade protection may lead to very large payouts to a small number of producers and hence is often inequitable."
32,"Any time a product receives import protection, of course, a relatively small number of domestic producers receive benefits--through higher prices--at the cost of all domestic consumers in the economy."
33,"For example, more than one-half of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders in place as of August were on iron and steel-related products alone; by contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of total private nonfarm employment is accounted for by iron and steel producers.24 As another example, according to a 1993 General Accounting Office study, 42 percent of the benefits to growers from sugar protection went to just 1 percent of growers.25 Although Americans favor policies designed to help the small farmer, much larger enterprises are also benefiting from agricultural trade protection."
34,"These provisions, which have been ruled illegal by the WTO, lead to protected producers being rewarded twice: Once through the higher prices stemming from the trade protection and again through the disbursal of the higher duties paid by importers."
35,"By restricting the supply of certain types of imports within the United States, quotas may benefit those foreign producers who retain the right to sell to U.S. markets by raising the prices of their goods."
