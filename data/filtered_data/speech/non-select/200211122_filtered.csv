0,I’ll come back to that decision and share some of my thoughts about the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in stimulating aggregate demand.
1,"For example, despite the relatively modest pace of output growth, productivity gains have been atypically large this year."
2,"In the long run, strong growth of productivity is unambiguously positive, as it implies that the prospects for increases in the general standard of living remain favorable."
3,The level of private payroll employment in October is still only marginally above the April low.
4,And the unemployment rate has come down only slightly from its 6 percent peak earlier this year.
5,"First, the downturn in 2001 itself exhibited some unusual features that have contributed to the patterns of economic growth this year."
6,"But a lack of pent-up demand coming out of the recession was also noticeable in other areas of household spending, especially consumer durables other than motor vehicles."
7,"In the most recent cycle, however, the main source of the economic shock to demand was a large drop in capital expenditures."
8,The boom in high-tech spending appears to have been sparked by the confluence of three key trends: the rapid growth in computing power generated by dramatic advances in semiconductor technology; the advent of new networking technologies that permitted computers to communicate more easily with each other in private networks and through the public Internet; and the development of software programs that facilitated these interactions and greatly expanded the use of personal computers.
9,"As a result, the economy was left with a bulge in corporate defaults for investors to absorb, and an overhang of high-tech capital, which has subsequently exerted a substantial drag on business spending and economic activity."
10,"Nevertheless, household spending, aided by solid income gains that were fueled by continued productivity growth and income tax cuts, held up quite well during the economic downturn."
11,"That strength has continued into this year, supported by low interest rates and substantial motor vehicle incentives."
12,"But, as I noted above, the absence of pent-up demand among consumers has limited the extent to which the household sector has contributed to growth this year."
13,"In addition, foreign economic growth has remained relatively anemic."
14,"This weakness in foreign activity has restrained the demand for our exports, with adverse consequences for U.S. manufacturers."
15,Payroll employment has turned down again after rising this summer.
16,And layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance continue to run at elevated levels.
17,"Taking account of these latest signals, the climate of heightened uncertainty, and the very favorable prospects for inflation, the FOMC last week cut the target for the funds rate by 50 basis points."
18,"In particular, the fact that the economy has grown at only a moderate pace this year despite sizable reductions in interest rates over the past year and a half has led some observers to argue that monetary policy has lost its punch."
19,Academics and policymakers always thought that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags and that both the level of rates and the time required for policy to have the desired equilibrating effect depend greatly on the force of the macroeconomic instability that must be confronted.
20,"To judge the effectiveness of monetary policy, one must consider what the economy would have looked like in the absence of easing."
21,"In this light, given the severity of the shocks that have hit the economy, a better interpretation may well be that recent events validate once again the potency of monetary policy."
22,"In my judgment, monetary policy has, in fact, countered some of the negative forces weighing on the economy."
23,"Residential investment has no doubt been buoyed by policy easing, as lower mortgage rates offset the restraint from declines in employment, smaller gains in income, and lower levels of wealth."
24,"Lower interest rates have also made it attractive to refinance mortgages to reduce monthly payments, extract some buildup of home equity, and use the proceeds to pay down more-expensive forms of consumer credit, finance additional purchases, or pay for home renovations."
25,"Businesses, which have been feeling the pinch of lower corporate profits, have benefited from lower interest rates as well."
26,"Even so, the current environment of low inflation and concerns about the recovery have raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve will eventually run out of room to lower interest rates by enough to stimulate the economy."
27,"However, I do not think that macroeconomic outcomes will be sufficiently adverse to place us in imminent danger of hitting the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates."
28,Even more remote is the possibility that monetary policy will be unable to prevent deflation.
29,"To be sure, many firms, especially in the goods-producing sector, are experiencing declining prices."
30,"Goods prices have been declining this year, reflecting, in part, productivity improvements."
31,"Distinct from changes in relative prices, a general deflation would be disturbing both because it would be widely unexpected and because it would undermine the ability of monetary policy to operate through traditional channels."
32,"On that score, measures of overall price inflation are still running in the range of about 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate for the GDP and core PCE price indexes to a bit more than 2 percent for the core consumer price index."
33,"But the primary reason for weak net business borrowing this year seems to be a lack of demand, and in general, credit appears to be available to higher quality borrowers in both the business and the household sectors."
34,"Moreover, the longer-term prospects for economic growth in the United States continue to look favorable."
35,A key question in assessing those longer-run prospects is whether productivity growth in the years ahead will more closely resemble the substantial gains evident since 1995 or whether it will revert to the weaker performance of the period from 1973 to 1995.
36,The most recent record of productivity growth reinforces the view that future growth will follow the higher trend of the past half-decade.
37,Productivity is a cyclical variable that typically falls in recessions.
38,"However, during the most recent downturn, productivity never declined and instead continued to grow at a fairly strong pace."
39,"Moreover, after September 11, many economists feared that productivity growth would suffer a severe setback as businesses diverted resources to improving security and developing contingencies in the event of another terrorist attack."
40,"And, as I noted, increased caution has probably pushed many companies to find ways to get more productivity from their workers."
41,"Adjusting to new technologies takes time, and it is plausible that such an adjustment process has continued to boost productivity this year."
42,"More fundamentally, I believe that the trend in productivity has ratcheted up, and this development has been the driving force behind the recent extraordinary productivity growth."
43,"Thus, it seems to me that with last week’s easing in monetary policy, the pieces are in place to engender a gradual strengthening in economic activity in coming quarters."
44,"With the real federal funds rate now below zero, monetary policy is providing considerable support to the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy."
45,"Similarly, fiscal policy remains conducive to growth."
46,"As a result, with underlying productivity gains likely to remain strong, business profits and household income should resume their uptrend, setting the stage for a renewed pickup in private spending growth."
47,"Of course, with inflation quite low and with significant excess capacity remaining in labor and product markets, we will need to remain watchful for any additional signs of economic weakness."
