2,"October 07, 2021 Building Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of Economic Research Governor Lael Brainard At the 2021 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts (via webcast) Share I want to thank all of you for joining our research conference and the organizing committee for inviting me to share some thoughts on climate scenario analysis.1 Economic analysis suggests that climate change could have profound consequences for the level, trend growth, and variability of economic activity over time and across regions and sectors."
3,"Sudden asset price changes can lead to financial instability when they interact with other vulnerabilities, such as high leverage or correlated exposures.8 Scenario analysis is a useful tool in assessing the links between climate-related risks and economic outcomes because it requires assessing the implications for financial stability and individual financial institutions in a systematic way."
4,"Economic activity has tended to rebound quickly after sporadic extreme weather events in recent experience, often supported by significant reconstruction."
5,"These cumulative and chronic changes could have economic effects that differ substantively from the historic experience, for example, if they contribute to shifts in the location of economic activity or the sectoral composition within a region."
6,"The physical manifestations of climate change could increase the volatility of economic activity and slow economic growth.15 The cumulative effects associated with climate change could lead to irreversible ""tipping points"" that introduce new climate shocks and change the relationships between climate-related shocks and economic variables."
7,"While standard models for projecting the net revenues of financial institutions are typically driven by national-level proxies of aggregate demand, such as growth and unemployment levels, additional sectoral and regional granularity will be necessary for climate scenario analysis."
