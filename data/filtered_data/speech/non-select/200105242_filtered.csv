0,"The synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity."
1,"The capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity prices, contributing to a substantial pickup in household spending on a broad range of goods and services, especially on new homes and durable goods."
2,"By early 2000, the surge in household and business spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be continued."
3,"And even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in some cases new supply was coming on even faster."
4,"Clearly, some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a more balanced growth path."
5,"Growth of outlays of consumer durable goods slowed in the middle of last year and shipments of capital equipment, excluding aircraft, have declined since late in the year."
6,"More advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies have enabled our firms in recent years to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in sales, but apparently these improvements have not yet solved the thornier problem of anticipating demand."
7,"Of course, the timing and force with which that process plays out will depend on the behavior of final demand."
8,"The demand for capital equipment, however, is more problematic."
9,"Gains in compensation per hour picked up over the past year, responding to a long period of very tight labor markets and the effects of an energy-induced run-up in consumer prices."
10,"Faster increases in hourly compensation, coupled with the cyclical slowdown in the growth of output per hour, have elevated the rate of increase in unit labor costs."
11,"Prices paid for natural gas and petroleum products by these corporations continued to rise into the first quarter, but have eased this spring."
12,"Electric power prices, however, continued to rise sharply through last month."
13,"The rise in natural gas prices last quarter contributed directly and indirectly (through its effect on the cost of electrical power generation) much of the rise in overall energy costs for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations."
14,"Because we import little natural gas, higher prices largely result in a transfer of income from natural gas users to natural gas producers."
15,"Nonetheless, these higher prices are likely to weigh on the economy in the short run because the increase in capital spending by energy producers is unlikely to offset the drag on spending by energy consumers."
16,"If overall final demand holds up reasonably well, the rate of inventory liquidation must begin to slow as inventory levels shrink toward operational targets."
17,"In the past, such episodes -- with their associated increases in employment, household incomes, and profits -- would engender a cycle of expansion, including a pickup in investment."
18,"Whether the well-advanced inventory cycle provides support for recovery, or whether a further weakening of investment and consumption demand undercuts that support, should become increasingly evident in the weeks and months ahead."
19,The persuasive evidence that the growth of structural productivity remains well maintained and that prospective long-term rates of return probably have been only marginally diminished suggests a solid underpinning to capital spending.
20,"At that point, rather than returning to the outsized 50 percent annual growth rates of last year, a more sustainable pace should be expected."
21,"Of course, investment demands ultimately depend on the strength of the consumer markets for goods and services."
22,"Here too, longer-run advances in real income and spending resulting from an acceleration of productivity and real wages should provide support over time."
23,"Importantly, the same downward pressure on profits and the heightened sense of risk that have restrained investment have also lowered equity prices and reduced household wealth."
24,"We can expect the decline in wealth that has occurred over the past year to restrain household spending relative to the growth of income, just as the previous increase gave an extra boost to household demand."
25,More recent concerns have arisen with respect to possible effects of higher gasoline prices on the economy.
26,"A rise in these prices this summer, as many fear, would, as always, act as a tax on households' incomes and spending, hardly welcome in today's context."
27,"However, while wholesale and retail prices for gasoline have surged in recent months, crude prices have not."
28,"With some temporarily closed refining capacity coming back on-line, and with higher gasoline prices likely to curb consumption and draw in product imports, market forces seem to be poised to contain further price increases at the pump."
29,Presumably this is the reason that gasoline prices for future wholesale delivery are well below current elevated levels.
30,The economic developments of the last couple of years have been a particular challenge for monetary policy.
31,The shortfall of saving to finance investment showed through in a significant rise in average real long-term corporate interest rates starting in early 1999.
32,"In fact, the 175 basis point increase in our target federal funds rate through May of 2000 barely slowed the expansion of liquidity, judging from the growth in M2 money supply, which declined only modestly through the tightening period."
33,"By summer of last year, it was finally becoming apparent that the growth of demand was slowing and its evident excess over the growth of potential supply, as proxied by a diminishing pool of available labor, was being contained."
34,"To have disturbed that balance with a decline in the targeted federal funds rate at that time, in our judgment, would have risked cutting short the adjustments needed to sustain long-term economic growth."
35,"Is the steepening wholly a reflection of an expected firming in economic activity, or are rising inflation expectations lurking in the figures?"
36,"Still, the spread between rates on nominal ten-year Treasury notes and inflation-indexed ten-year maturities has risen about half a percentage point since mid-March -- not an insignificant change."
37,"Interestingly, despite some apparent deterioration in actual and expected CPI inflation, there has been little acceleration in the broader index of core personal consumption expenditure prices."
38,"In that regard, the lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores an absence of inflationary zest."
39,"With energy inflation probably peaking and the easing of tightness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases, prices seem likely to be contained."
40,We have often pointed before to the essential role that low inflation expectations play in containing price pressures and promoting growth.
41,"Forecasts of the suppression or re-emergence of inflation, like all forecasts, do not have an enviable record."
42,"Faced with this inevitable uncertainty, a central bank's vigilance against inflation is more than a monetary policy cliche, it is, of course, the way we fulfill our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable growth."
43,A central bank can contain inflation over time under most conditions.
44,"Can fiscal and monetary policy acting at their optimum eliminate the business cycle, as some of the more optimistic followers of J.M."
45,And variations in technology and risk will appropriately affect asset prices to allocate capital efficiently in a market system.
46,"But, on occasion, asset prices can vary by more than can be attributed to underlying fundamentals."
47,Asset prices lose their upside potential and come under downward pressure as investors reevaluate risk and revise expectations for outsized gains.
48,"Monetary policy, as we currently practice it, endeavors to lean against the propensities for economic overshooting, from whatever source, by changing interest rates."
49,"Indeed, as I already noted, movements in asset prices most often reflect changing underlying fundamentals."
50,"Forecasts that an increase in an asset price is a bubble would likely run counter to the conventional wisdom of a large segment of the investment community, or asset prices would not be so high."
51,"Indeed, were we to lower overnight rates in advance of an expected break in asset prices, we would, presumably, only exacerbate the economic and financial imbalances."
52,"Our only realistic alternative is to lean against the economic pressures that may accompany a rise in asset prices, bubble or not, and address forcefully the consequences of a sharp deflation of asset prices."
53,"While we are limited in our ability to anticipate and act on asset price bubbles, expectations about future economic developments overall inevitably play a crucial role in our policymaking."
54,"If we only react to past or current developments, lags in the effects of monetary policy could end up destabilizing the economy, as history has amply shown."
55,"In reducing the federal funds rate this year by 250 basis points in a compressed period, we have been responding to our judgment that a good part of the weakening of demand was likely to persist for a while, and that there were significant downside risks even to a weaker central tendency forecast."
56,"Moreover, with inflation low and likely to be contained, the main threat to satisfactory economic performance appeared to come from excessive weakness in activity."
57,So we took out the restraint inherent in our previous policy stance and have moved policy to a more accommodative posture to counter the effects of the downshift in demand.
58,Real interest rates are down substantially in a wide variety of borrowing instruments.
59,"And the growth of liquidity, as measured by M2, has picked up."
60,"Owing to the variable and long lags of monetary policy, the effect of our recent policy initiatives will take time to strengthen financial portfolios and spill over into demand for goods and services."
61,"The period of sub-par economic growth is not yet over, and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated, requiring further policy response."
62,But we also need to be aware that our front-loaded policy actions this year should be providing substantial support for a strengthening of economic activity later this year.
63,"Moreover, with all our concerns about the next several quarters, there is still, in my judgment, ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth rate in productivity to a level significantly above that of the two decades preceding 1995."
