1,"Most observers expect Social Security, under existing law, to be in chronic deficit over the long haul; however, the program is largely defined benefit, and so the scale of the necessary adjustments is limited."
2,Medicare faces financial pressure not only from the changing composition of the population but also from continually increased per recipient demand for medical services.
3,"The combination of rapidly advancing medical technologies and our current system of subsidized third-party payments suggests continued rapid growth in demand, though future Medicare costs are admittedly very difficult to forecast."
4,"The resources available to fund the sum of future retirement benefits and the real incomes of the employed will depend, of course, on the growth rate of labor employed plus the growth rate of the productivity of that labor."
5,The growth rate of the U.S. working-age population is expected to decline substantially over the next two decades and to remain low thereafter.
6,"In addition, work is becoming less physically strenuous but more demanding intellectually, continuing a century-long trend toward a more-conceptual and less-physical economic output."
7,"Of course, immigration, if we choose to expand it, could also lessen the decline of labor force growth in the United States."
8,* * * It is thus heightened growth of output per worker that offers the greatest potential for boosting U.S. gross domestic product to a level that would enable future retirees to maintain their expected standard of living without unduly burdening future workers.

16,"Although domestic investment has accounted for only half our recent productivity gains, its contribution has historically been much larger."
17,"Should the pace of efficiency gains slow, it would fall to the level of investment to again become the major contributor to productivity gains."

19,"* * * A doubling of the over-65 population by 2035 will substantially augment unified budget deficits and, accordingly, reduce federal saving unless actions are taken."
