0,"In this spirit, I would like to review last year's economic performance and then raise some topics related to the underpinnings of macroeconomics and monetary policy."
1,Economic Performance in 1999 Last year presented various challenges for monetary policymakers.
2,"Domestic demand was particularly strong, led by consumption expenditures, which grew 5½ percent last year."
3,Long-term interest rates trended downward in early 1999 but more than retraced those declines by the end of the year.
4,"Equity prices rose over much of 1999, raising the value of household assets and improving the general sense of financial well-being of our citizens as well as lowering the cost of capital faced by businesses."
5,"Recovery in Asia, with perhaps the apparent exception of Japan, and a pick-up in growth in Europe accompanied this good news in the United States."
6,"During the first half of 1998, net exports subtracted almost 1¾ percentage points from GDP growth."
7,"With conditions improving overseas, the external sector subtracted less than ¾ percentage point from growth in the second half of 1999."
8,The sense of the FOMC was that the tightening of labor markets that accompanied a growth of demand exceeding even the stepped-up pace of supply growth would likely create upward pressures on labor costs and eventually on the rate of price inflation.
9,"At the February meeting, the FOMC also abandoned the approach of discussing ""biases"" regarding interest rate movements, which seemed to engender overly strong reactions or a misreading of our intentions from markets."
10,"Using this new approach, the FOMC earlier this month indicated a concern that risks were weighted mainly toward conditions that might lead to increased inflation."
11,Sources of Performance Four major forces provide the underpinning for the vigorous domestic growth we are currently experiencing.
12,"This capital spending, along with the apparent technological improvements, is thought to have been important in the increase in productivity--the output of goods and services per hour of work--that is currently providing such momentum for the economy of the United States."
13,The final major force is the reduction of both actual and expected inflation.
14,Relatively stable prices have allowed businesses and households to plan their economic affairs with an expectation that the value of investments will not be eroded through a pernicious and uncertain increase in the general price level.
15,"Indeed, relative price level stability has reinforced the impetus provided by deregulation for businesses to manage their affairs with a priority on efficiency."
16,"The first issue I wish to raise involves the supply side of the economy and grows out of the recent, unusual conjuncture of rapid growth and high resource utilization with low and stable inflation."
17,"The two most prominent measures of resource tightness, capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment, have historically moved fairly closely together over the cycle."
18,"We need a better understanding of the implications of this divergence and, in particular, a clearer sense of which measure, or combination of measures, of resource utilization best foreshadows the emergence of price pressures."
19,"Now, we hear, capacity in manufacturing is more technology intensive and can be adjusted more easily to reflect supply and demand conditions."
20,"During this episode of strong growth, the average workweek has not increased significantly."
21,"Given the various other elements of evidence regarding labor market tightness, including survey data on job market conditions and the measured unemployment rate, I find it puzzling that both the workweek and the labor force participation rate have not increased more strongly."
22,"Equity prices are set by the give-and-take of supply and demand, with participants buying and selling based on their own information that shapes their long-term expectations."
23,I believe that the Federal Reserve's tools--primarily short-term interest rates--are too blunt to attempt to achieve specific levels of stock market valuations.
24,"Simply put, equity prices should properly be thought of as a relative price-the value of the existing capital stock relative to that of goods."
25,Central banks are not good at fine-tuning relative prices.
26,"Rather, leave us the responsibility for determining the policy that anchors the general price level in the long run."
27,"Therefore, equity prices affect business fixed investment, a major driver of our economy."
28,"Given the economic importance of equity prices, it is reasonable for policymakers to monitor developments in this market even if we do not ""target"" specific values."
29,We have seen in other economies that the bursting of bubbles in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that affect real economic activity.
30,"Economists propose numerous approaches to determining the ""correct"" level of equity prices."
31,"One such approach compares equity market valuations (namely earnings-price ratios) to the return on fixed-income securities, generally the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond."
32,"Therefore, these observers assert that lower premiums over risk-free returns are appropriate and that old relationships between earnings-price ratios and the return on Treasury instruments no longer hold."
33,"The same adjustment would have reduced the growth rate of reported income for S&P 1500 firms almost 2½ percentage points per year, on average, during the 1996-98 period."
34,"When looked at with these refinements, the current earnings-price ratios appear even more out of alignment with historical experience."
35,"Our mandate gives priority to price stability and maximum sustainable employment, which I think are the right elements for us to consider in policy deliberations."
36,"Certainly, developments in the international sector, in particular a large and growing current account deficit, might indicate that there are imbalances in the economy of the United States."
37,"Similarly, movements in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar might transmit pressures on inflation, but they also are an important transmission mechanism for monetary policy."
38,"However, managing the external balance and the exchange value of the U.S. dollar is obviously not the goal of monetary policy."
39,"This, of course, means that even sustaining trend growth both in the United States and in our trading partners will not necessarily close the trade gap."
40,To do so would require a period of sustained stronger-than-trend growth overseas.
41,Many professional economists and market observers now question the sustainability of our current account deficit.
42,"I suggest that the combination of a large current account deficit and a strong U.S. dollar is, in part, a reflection of the relative attractiveness of the U.S. economy as a destination for foreign capital."
43,The answer depends on the ability of businesses and workers in the United States to continue to generate growing productivity increases.
44,"Because few of us forecast the current period of investment-driven productivity increases, it is difficult to predict when it will end."
45,"We know only that, at some point, productivity will stop accelerating."
46,"Additionally, the last twenty-four months have raised an important set of questions regarding measures of real economic performance, the behavior of inflation, financial market indicators, and the growing globalization of today's economy."
