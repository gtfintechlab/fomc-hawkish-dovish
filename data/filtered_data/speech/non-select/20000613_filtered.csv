0,"In particular, I will emphasize the potential to improve our understanding of the performance of productivity from delving into the microeconomic details of our current business environment."
1,"Until recently, much of the professional debate on the performance of productivity centered on whether there had been any meaningful acceleration of nonfarm business sector output per hour--a standard measure of aggregate productivity."
2,That there has been some underlying improvement in the growth of aggregate productivity is now generally conceded by all but the most skeptical.
3,A great deal of the evidence offered by the participants in this debate focuses on examinations of very aggregative measures of productivity.
4,"However, while the application of sophisticated filtering techniques, cyclical adjustment procedures, and other statistical tools to the analysis of aggregate productivity may improve our understanding in some respects, these approaches ultimately have significant limitations."
5,"Only when data are disaggregated can we reasonably hope to tie productivity performance directly to business practices in our offices, on our plant floors, and through our distribution channels."
6,"To make any headway toward understanding productivity trends, one must first understand the data."
7,"For example, separating nonfarm business sector output per hour into nonfinancial corporate, financial corporate, and noncorporate sectors has revealed disquieting problems with the measurement of productivity, especially in the noncorporate sector.1 The Commerce Department will soon release data on output by industry, or ""gross product originating,"" which will allow this decomposition to be updated to more fully reflect the benchmark revision to the national income and product accounts (NIPA) published last fall."
8,"Indeed, the data pointed to falling levels of productivity for many years in such industries as construction and medical, legal, and business services--areas that are important in the noncorporate sector."
9,"Putting aside the issue of data revisions, some analysts argue that such disaggregation of national productivity measures is inappropriate."
10,They point out that inaccurate estimates of intermediate inputs and prices can shift measured value added from one sector of the economy to another without affecting the total.
11,The implication is that aggregate productivity is measured more accurately than sectoral productivity.
12,"Consequently, the hypothesis that the currently estimated flat productivity of the noncorporate sector in recent years largely results from output misattributed to the corporate sector seems improbable."
13,The sources of the productivity measurement problems in the noncorporate sector are not entirely clear.
14,"Although it is conceivable that the problem could be mismeasurement of nominal incomes, difficulties with price measurement likely are the more important factor."
15,The 1996 Boskin Commission documented widespread upward bias in estimated price change.
16,"If the biases are greater in the price indexes that implicitly are employed to deflate nominal noncorporate incomes, as I suspect, the output and productivity growth of this sector would be understated."
17,"Whatever the source of the measurement error, it simply is not credible that for many years the noncorporate sector has experienced no productivity growth."
18,None of the available measures of productivity are without drawbacks.
19,"But I prefer to focus greater attention on the productivity measure for the nonfinancial corporate sector, which accounts for some 70 percent of total nonfarm business product."
20,These figures eliminate the clearly mismeasured productivity of the noncorporate sector and avoid the thorny conceptual issues surrounding measurement of the financial sector.
21,"The remainder, while far from perfect, may provide a better representation of productivity developments in the economy."
22,"In my judgment, this income-side framework has the advantage that it is better suited to identifying the forces of cost containment that have been so critical in engendering productivity growth at the company level."
23,"Hence, over most of the past half-century the average growth rates of output and productivity measured from the product and the income side usually have not differed by much."
24,"The statistical discrepancy has swung sharply since late 1992, reflecting an annual growth rate in real gross domestic income that has been 0.4 percentage point higher than the growth rate of real gross domestic product."
25,This difference is reflected directly in faster growth of productivity measured on the income side than that measured on the product side of the accounts.
26,"But that said, the differences in productivity growth measured on the product and the income sides of the accounts are large enough to be economically meaningful."
27,"But for understanding the behavior of prices, costs, and productivity, using the consolidated and internally consistent income-side accounts, unencumbered by a changing statistical discrepancy, has advantages."
28,"To illustrate with recent developments in the nonfinancial corporate sector, for about four years price inflation has remained subdued--with prices rising on average about 1/2 percent per year."
29,"During that period, growth in hourly compensation has stepped up, and profitability has been strong."
30,"In the framework of this income-side system, the answer is an acceleration of labor productivity; indeed, for the nonfinancial corporate sector, output per hour has accelerated from around a 1-1/2 percent pace in the first half of the 1990s to more than a 4 percent pace over the past couple of years."
31,"Indeed, one need not have adverted to the national income and product accounts at all to surmise the early emergence of productivity acceleration."
32,"Domestic operating profit margins, rising as they did from 1995 into 1997 in an environment of falling inflation, necessarily implied falling rates of total unit cost increases--most credibly the consequence of rising productivity growth."
33,"Substantial increases in U.S. capital investment, and the accompanying faster growth of our capital stock relative to labor input--so-called capital deepening--explain a large part of the pickup in underlying growth in output per hour over the past five years, irrespective of how measured."
34,But there has also been a marked step-up in the growth of so-called multifactor productivity (MFP).
35,"MFP is, of course, that portion of labor productivity that cannot be explained by other identifiable inputs into the production process."
36,This conclusion runs counter to our usual expectation that increased supply brings down the marginal product of capital and is certainly consistent with some continuing improvement in multifactor productivity.
37,These developments allowed firms to boost earnings in the face of intense competitive pressures through a reduction in the growth of unit costs.
38,"The important contribution of these new technologies is quite evident from another interesting disaggregation of the macroeconomic data, carried out by Stephen Oliner and Dan Sichel at the Federal Reserve Board in some recent research.2 Their paper shows that much of the jump in productivity growth since the mid-1990s can be explained by two factors related to new information technologies."
39,"Most important, businesses throughout the economy have installed a great deal of information technology capital in recent years, which has boosted productivity growth through the associated capital deepening."
40,"In addition, the companies that produce computers and the embedded semiconductors appear to have achieved major efficiencies in their own operations, which have boosted MFP growth for the economy as a whole."
41,"Taking these two effects together, the authors estimate that since 1995 information technologies have contributed about one-half of the acceleration of productivity measured on the income side and about two-thirds of the acceleration of productivity when measured on the product side."
42,"Yet, in the vibrant economic conditions that have accompanied this period of rapid gains in productivity, labor resources freed up by technical advance have found ready opportunities elsewhere."
43,"Indeed, many more jobs have been created than have been lost, and our unemployment rate has fallen notably as technology has blossomed."
44,"Information technologies, by improving our real-time understanding of production processes and of the vagaries of consumer demand, are reducing the degree of uncertainty and, hence, risk."
45,This has meant that employment of scarce resources to deal with heightened risk premiums has been reduced.
46,"Not all technologies, information or otherwise, however, increase productivity--that is, output per hour--by reducing the inputs necessary to produce existing products."
47,"The dramatic advances in biotechnology, for example, are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine."
48,"In summary then, most of the gains in the level and the growth rate of productivity in the United States since 1995 appear to have been structural, largely driven by irreversible advances in technology and its application--irreversible in the sense that knowledge once gained is almost never lost."
49,"And, on the other side, a cyclical slowing in demand is not usually matched by a prompt scaling back of employment, resulting in a temporary decline in output per hour or, at best, a significant slowing in its growth rate."
50,"But cutting through the inevitable cyclical fluctuation of measured output per hour, the evidence of a decided improvement in the growth rate of structural productivity from the macro data has continued to strengthen."
51,"Disaggregative probings of the productivity data, as well as direct observation of the performance of U.S. businesses lend considerable credibility to the notion that our economy is benefiting from structural gains in productivity that have been driven by a remarkable wave of technological innovation."
52,"Footnotes 1 The initial work in this area by the Board=s staff appeared in 1996 in Lawrence Slifman and Carol Corrado, ""Decomposition of Productivity and Unit Costs,"" available at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss."
53,"An updated version of the paper was published as Carol Corrado and Lawrence Slifman, ""Decomposition of Productivity and Unit Costs,"" American Economic Review, vol."
