0,"The conference's subject, the impact of financial innovation on monetary policy, is one of fundamental interest to central banks."
1,"Bill has asked me to provide my thoughts on one of the important structural changes of recent years, consolidation in the global financial system and its ramifications for monetary policy and other areas of central bank concern."
2,Monetary Policy One of our more important policy concerns in designing the study--and the issue of greatest relevance to the participants in this conference--was the potential effect of financial consolidation on the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.
3,"First, it seemed possible that consolidation could make it more difficult for central banks to implement policy if it reduced the efficiency of the market for central bank reserves or the markets used in the conduct of monetary policy operations."
4,The second possibility was that consolidation could affect the transmission mechanism linking changes in the policy interest rate to the real economy.
5,Consolidation could do so if it affected the liquidity or volatility of key financial markets and so the arbitraging of interest rates across instruments and maturities.
6,"Moreover, consolidation could, at least in theory, alter the credit channels of monetary policy."
7,"For example, if consolidation fostered the creation of larger banks having better access to markets for managed liabilities, it could affect the way that the availability and pricing of bank loans adjust in response to changes in the stance of monetary policy."
8,"This could occur if consolidation led to the faster transmission of shocks across markets or geographical regions, or affected the behavior of indicator variables such as monetary and credit aggregates used by monetary policy makers."
9,Consolidation could also affect the policy environment by contributing to the formation of very large and complex financial institutions: Difficulties at such firms could pose challenges for central banks in both their monetary policy and lender of last resort roles.
10,"Despite these concerns, the study finds that financial consolidation has not significantly affected the ability of central banks to achieve the objectives of monetary policy."
11,"As part of our research, we asked central banks in all the nations studied about their experiences with consolidation and the implementation of monetary policy."
12,"A key reason for this finding is that even with the substantial consolidation we have observed, the financial markets important for monetary policy have generally remained highly competitive."
13,"Clearly, in the event of financial difficulties at a very large and complex institution, central banks would need to evaluate carefully the appropriate level and duration of emergency liquidity provision, as well as the possible need to adjust, perhaps only for a short period of time, the stance of monetary policy."
14,"On balance, and despite these positive results, our study recommends that central banks should remain alert to the implications of any future reductions in the competitiveness of the markets most important for monetary policy implementation."
15,"Similarly, we suggest that central banks ought to monitor potential future effects on the transmission mechanism for monetary policy."
16,Monetary policy is simply too important to the health of all our economies to do otherwise.
17,"Consolidation, and especially any resulting increased complexity of financial institutions, appears to have increased both the demand by market participants for and the supply by institutions of information regarding a firm's financial condition."
