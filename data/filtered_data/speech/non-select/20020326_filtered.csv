0,"First, I will touch briefly on the current economic situation and on why, despite the weak pace of economic activity in 2001, I see the longer-run outlook for the U.S. economy as quite favorable."
1,"That remarkable expansion was notable not only for its duration but also for its rapid advances in technology, which fueled a surge in business capital spending, an acceleration in productivity, and rapid gains in real income and wealth."
2,"However, when demand began to slow in late 2000, businesses were faced with uncomfortably high levels of inventories, an oversupply of capital goods, and declining profits."
3,"Buoyed by low interest rates, falling energy prices, and tax cuts, home sales last year remained near a record high, motor vehicle sales peaked at their highest level ever, and overall real personal consumption expenditures increased about 3 percent, a rate well below the pace of the previous few years but still very respectable given the uncertainty of the times."
4,"A more important fact for the longer-run outlook is that, in comparison with the start of other recessions since the mid-1970s, the economy entered the recent slowdown with a much lower rate of inflation and a noticeably higher rate of increase in productivity."
5,One favorable consequence of the subdued rate of inflation last year was that monetary policy was able to move aggressively to limit the extent of the downturn.
6,Productivity growth during the recession has been even more strikingly out of character for a standard business cycle.
7,"Typically, a cyclical downturn in business activity leads to declines in or, at best, very anemic gains in labor productivity as firms struggle to adjust to declining demand and less efficient operating rates."
8,That the recession does not appear to have much dented the rate of growth in productivity supports the view that the step-up in such growth that emerged in the mid-1990s resulted not only from the rapid expansion of real output but also from a more lasting shift in the structural trend rate of increase.
9,The fundamental change in the pace of labor productivity seems to confirm what businesses were telling us--that they had used a wide range of technological advances and managerial innovations to improve their supply-chain management and information systems and to better tailor their products and services to meet customer demands.
10,That is important because faster productivity growth is the crucial determinant of how quickly we can raise our nation's real standard of living.
11,Productivity improvement has a bit of the same flavor as compound interest: For one year the number does not seem large.
12,"If productivity increases 1-1/2 percent per year on average, our standard of living will double about every forty-six years--or about every two generations."
13,"But if productivity rises 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every twenty-three years--or about every generation."
14,"Between the business cycle peak last March and this past January, employers shed almost 1-1/2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose more than 1 percentage point, to 5.6 percent, its highest level since mid-1995."
15,"Although the unemployment rate is still well below the peak rates reached in any recession since 1948, the comparison may be small comfort to those of you who are about to enter the labor market."
16,"However, I am optimistic that, with the adjustments to production and inventories now largely behind us, the longer-run trends in productivity and output will begin to reassert themselves."
17,Project life cycles are shorter now than in the past as firms aim to foster flexibility to keep up with the demand for new products.
18,"But even for permanent employees, the employment relation between the firm and its workers has changed significantly."
19,The rise in the use of less-traditional conditions of employment is one clear example of this.
