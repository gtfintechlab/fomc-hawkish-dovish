0,"Second, how should monetary policy respond to the greater uncertainty both about forecasts and about the structural relationships that have guided policy in the past?"
1,They demanded a coherent story that tied the forecast together.
2,"Specifically, they allow for sticky prices, and as a result output is demand-determined in the short run."
3,"Specifically output is supply-determined in the long run, inflation is principally a monetary phenomenon, real interest rates are determined by forces of productivity and thrift, and nominal interest rates vary with inflation."
4,"Third, the price-wage dynamics in the model, most often captured in the Phillips curve, provide the equilibrating mechanism that guides the transition from short run to long run."
5,This sector essentially pins down just how sticky prices are and how long it takes for price flexibility to push the economy to a long-run equilibrium.
6,The neoclassical synthesis suggests separating the economy's experience into short-run cycles and long-run growth.
7,"In early expressions of this framework, the long-run or trend growth rate was generally viewed as relatively stable, so that short-run movements in output could easily be interpreted as movements in demand relative to long-run supply."
8,"However, the experience of the 1990s, reinforcing the lessons of the 1970s, suggests that the earlier view of demand-induced variation around a smooth long-term trend is overly simplistic."
9,"In addition, a narrow definition of supply shocks that covers only relative price shocks--such as the oil price jumps in the 1970s--fails to do justice to the range of supply-side developments that have so affected output and inflation dynamics, particularly in the 1970s and 1990s."
10,"In each episode, powerful supply-side shocks included significant changes in our estimates of both the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and the productivity trend."
11,And we are not likely to be satisfied again with a vision that begins from a presumed stable trend in output growth.
12,"Specifically, there are signs of both a decline in the NAIRU and an increase in trend growth."
13,"These changes suggest that the economy can maintain stable inflation at a lower unemployment rate and, if not already beyond the point of full employment, can grow faster without a threat of overheating than had been the case for the previous two decades or more."
14,This seems particularly restrictive for some parameters--specifically the NAIRU and trend growth--that can be and should be expected to evolve over time.
15,"At the Fed, reflecting no doubt the demands of having to make policy in a world of incomplete information and the continuing questions about the estimates of the NAIRU and trend productivity, the staff has been continuously updating its estimates of both parameters."
16,These revised estimates have been instrumental in conditioning the staff forecasts of both inflation and real economic activity and have clearly played an important role in the policy deliberations and actions.
17,I find this approach especially appealing for the estimation of parameters such as the NAIRU and trend growth.
18,"We therefore try to extract the parameter from estimation of some structural equation, such as a Phillips curve in the case of the NAIRU or an equation for the demand for labor in the case of productivity."
19,I appreciate that the traditional paradigm provides less direction in forecasting and policy analysis when it admits time-varying parameters for the NAIRU and trend productivity growth.
20,"It is true, however, that the optimal strategy for monetary policy might be affected by the higher degree of uncertainty surrounding key parameters in the model."
21,"In the extreme, it appears to hold that there are no limits--no level of capacity that, if exceeded, induces higher inflation and no trend rate of growth that, if consistently exceeded, implies an increase in production relative to capacity leading, over time, to excess demand and higher inflation."
22,"Many who are viewed as new economy proponents can perhaps be understood, within this paradigm, as believing in one or more of the following: the NAIRU is lower than the 5 percent to 5 ¼ percent estimate that I now use, trend productivity growth is higher than the 2 ½ percent rate I now feel comfortable with, and productivity growth is still rising."
23,"In addition, new economy proponents may be interpreted as favoring a policy that probes for the limits of how low the NAIRU and how high trend growth might be."
24,"In light of uncertainties about these parameters, this policy would encourage a less pre-emptive and more reactive approach to the threat of higher inflation."
25,"Implications of the Paradigm for Inflation and Growth Today, the challenge of explaining recent economic performance leads me to focus my attention on the implications of the paradigm sketched above for economic growth and inflation."
26,The growth framework embodied in this paradigm is generally the neoclassical growth model in which long-run growth is tied down by exogenous trends in population and multi-factor productivity.
27,"Capital deepening--that is, increases in capital relative to labor--can also have an influence on the growth of labor productivity."
28,"A change in the trend rate of growth, in this framework, would therefore reflect some combination of exogenous changes in population, multi-factor productivity trends, and endogenous capital deepening."
29,"In the current episode, the increase in the estimate of trend labor productivity from the 1.1 percent rate widely assumed coming into this expansion to what I expect has become the consensus estimate of 2 ½ percent today has three components."
30,"First, methodological changes--specifically revisions to measures of the price level and the recent accounting change to include software as a capital expenditure--have raised the measured trend rate of increase in labor productivity over a longer period."
31,Together these revisions in methodology have contributed about 0.4 percentage point to the increase in the trend growth rate relative to the earlier 1.1 percent estimate.
32,The third component is a possible increase in the trend rate of growth in multi-factor productivity.
33,"Having asserted the primacy of monetary forces in determining inflation in the long run, some may wonder at my well-known commitment to the Phillips curve."
34,"The Phillips curve, as I hope is well known, does not pin down the long-run inflation rate."
35,"In the vertical long-run Phillips curve specification, at least, any stable inflation rate is compatible with equilibrium in the labor and product markets."
36,"Instead, the Phillips curve specifies short-run inflation dynamics--how and why inflation moves from one path to another--and highlights the critical role of excess demand as a proximate source of rising inflation."
37,We learned in the 1970s that excess demand is not always the driving force behind movements in inflation.
38,"Sometimes excess demand dominates near-term movements in inflation, and sometimes supply shocks overwhelm the effects of overall supply/demand balance in the labor and product markets."
39,"As a result, the paradigm now always incorporates supply shocks as a second proximate source of changes in inflation."
40,"I find it useful to distinguish two types of supply shocks: first, relative price shocks, such as increases in the price of oil or food, unrelated to the balance between supply and demand in the overall economy; and second, the effect of an unexpected increase in the productivity trend."
41,Modeling the Effect of a Productivity Shock One of the most fascinating and complex shocks to evaluate is a shift in the underlying productivity trend.
42,"It is difficult to determine when such a shift takes place, both because productivity has such a powerful cyclical component and because productivity has a fairly large noise component."
43,"Another complication is that some adjustments to the productivity trend reflect methodological changes--for example, improvements in the estimates of price indexes."
44,These affect the estimate of productivity over a long period but do not translate into an acceleration in productivity growth in the current episode.
45,"Finally, there are a wide variety of repercussions from an increase in the productivity trend."
46,"Higher trend productivity, of course, means a higher average growth rate for real GDP."
47,But it has profound effects on demand as well as supply.
48,"A first inclination might be to assume that higher trend productivity translates into a more rapid advance in supply relative to demand, tilting the balance between supply and demand in the economy."
49,"In fact, a higher productivity trend also appears to produce perhaps as powerful a stimulus to demand."
50,"First, the technological shock that underpins higher productivity typically carries with it enhanced profit opportunities, spurring investment."
51,"Second, the same profit opportunities and associated optimism can be expected to drive equity prices higher, both reducing the financing cost of new investment and spurring consumer spending via the wealth effect."
52,"On balance, in the short run, demand may increase as much as supply, or even more so."
53,The point is that we cannot assume the higher trend productivity eliminates concern about overheating.
54,"Nevertheless, even if higher productivity has an equal impact on demand as on supply, it will still tend to damp inflationary pressures in the short run."
55,Let me explain in some detail how an unexpected increase in productivity growth operates as a temporary favorable supply shock in the traditional paradigm.
56,"I begin from a wage-price specification of the Phillips curve--that is, from an equation that explains the rate of growth of nominal compensation in terms of inflation and the gap between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU."
57,Such a specification also should include trend growth in labor productivity as an explanatory variable.
58,"Such a specification is necessary to ensure that, in the long run, when unemployment on average equals the NAIRU, nominal compensation increases at a rate equal to the sum of inflation and the trend rate of increase in labor productivity."
59,An increase in the productivity growth trend will have a temporary disinflationary effect if the specification of the wage-price sector incorporates an asymmetric response of wages and prices to the change in the productivity growth trend.
60,"Specifically, nominal compensation is assumed to respond more slowly than prices to a change in the trend rate of labor productivity."
61,"Of course, both wages and prices respond with a lag to an increase in the productivity trend because it takes time to sort out whether higher productivity is cyclical, just normal quarterly variability or a shift in the underlying trend."
62,But the more sluggish adjustment of nominal wages relative to prices reflects longer nominal contracts for wages than prices; possible information asymmetries (faster learning about the change in trend by businesses than by workers); and perhaps the role of slowly changing wage norms governing wage bargaining.
63,"As a result, there is initially almost no effect on nominal compensation from a change in the trend rate of productivity growth."
64,"With nearly unchanged compensation and higher productivity, firms find their costs lower and their profits higher than expected."
65,"Competition then results in price declines, eroding the profits and resulting in lower inflation than would otherwise have occurred."
66,"The lower inflation in turn moderates nominal compensation gains; that is, the same real increases now require smaller nominal gains."
67,"The result is a virtuous cycle of lower inflation, lower nominal compensation, and lower inflation."
68,"However, productivity shocks--like relative price supply shocks--result only in temporary departures of inflation from the underlying rate justified by longer-run influences such as money growth and shorter-run cyclical influences such as utilization rates."
69,"Once the influence of productivity growth in the wage change equation converges to its effect in the price equation, the asymmetry that drives the disinflationary effect of an unexpected increase in the productivity trend dissipates, assuming that productivity growth stabilizes."
70,"Evolution of the Traditional Model I now want to discuss four developments of special importance in the evolution of macroeconometric model building, building on the models in place by the late 1960s: the modeling of inflation dynamics, the incorporation of international linkages, the role of policy reaction functions, and the modeling of expectations."
71,"The underlying core of the life-cycle model of consumption, neoclassical models of investment and labor demand, and inventory-theoretic money demand remain intact."
72,"The most important change was the transition from a Phillips curve that allowed a long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment to the vertical, natural-rate specification."
73,"This was well entrenched by the mid-1970s and was accompanied by a more consistent treatment of inflation in the models, including more careful differentiation of nominal and real interest rates."
74,"In addition, by the mid 1970s the models moved to explicitly incorporate supply shocks, at least the relative-price type of shocks."
75,The second development of special importance is the change in the international sector owing to the increased openness of the U.S. economy as well as the effect of the change in the exchange rate regime.
76,"Today, imports are a more important part of the short-run dynamics of the model, including a significant role as a stabilizer of shocks to domestic demand."
77,"The experience suggests the importance of sufficiently broad measures of foreign economic activity and exchange rates in models, increasing the span of the world that forecasters have to consider in their forecasts for the United States."
78,The shift to a flexible exchange rate regime and the increased mobility of capital also has sharpened the responsiveness of real exchange rates to real interest rate differentials across countries.
79,"Combined with the increased importance of imports and exports, the heightened responsiveness of real exchange rates has increased the importance of the exchange rate channel in the transmission of monetary policy."
80,"In the Board staff's model, that channel now accounts for about a third of the responsiveness of aggregate demand to changes in interest rates over a one- to three-year period."
81,"Nevertheless, the overall interest sensitivity of aggregate demand appears to be nearly unchanged, at least until the last couple of years, because the increased role of exchange rates has been offset largely by the decreased interest sensitivity of housing due to the elimination of Regulation Q and innovations in financing home purchases."
82,"In the past few years, however, the sensitivity of the economy to interest rates may have increased as a result of a more powerful interest-induced wealth effect."
83,This development reflects the increase in the wealth-income ratio produced by the extraordinary rise in equity prices over the last several years.
84,"Finally, international developments clearly are helping to restrain U.S. inflation."
85,I expect that our inflation performance would have been less exceptional if the cycles in Europe and Japan had precisely matched our own and if the dollar had remained stable over the past three years.
86,A third evolution in structural models is the use of reaction functions to characterize monetary policy.
87,"At Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, we offered our clients a choice of monetary policy regime."
88,"They could treat a short-term interest rate, a measure of the money supply, or nonborrowed reserves as an exogenous variable (determined by discretionary policy) or switch on a policy reaction function (explicitly treating monetary policy actions as endogenous responses to economic developments)."
89,"All the options have their uses, but in a period when there is serious doubt about the stability of money demand, policy reaction functions provide an alternative approach to anchoring the determination of short-term interest rates."
90,"Ironically, policy reaction functions appear to be used more in models at the Federal Reserve, where monetary policy is made, than in the private sector, where monetary policy must be forecast."
91,"But after the first quarter or two, a policy reaction function provides a systematic way to relate monetary policy to the evolution of the forecast."
92,"Specifically, it depends on how utilization rates, growth, and inflation change over time and, at times, on changes in the forecast of these variables going forward."
93,The net result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky-price model.
94,"The model retains the neoclassical synthesis of the MPS model--short-run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long-run classical properties associated with price flexibility--and therefore produces multiplier results, in both the short and longer runs, that are very similar to those produced by the MPS model."
95,But the better-articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate effects on expectations of key variables such as inflation and interest rates.
96,"When I talk about the challenge for monetary policy in the current environment, I often see a look of surprise on the faces in the audience."
97,The second is to position monetary policy in light of the answer to the first challenge.
98,"From the perspective of the traditional models, the current expansion carries two surprises: the strength of domestic demand, explainable in part by the unexpectedly sharp increase in equity prices, and even more impressive, the decline in inflation (this year confined to core measures) despite steadily rising labor utilization rates, to a level well below virtually anyone's estimate of the NAIRU."
99,A significant part of the surprise in domestic demand reflects the unexpectedly sharp run-up in equity prices.
100,"Virtually all traditional models, I expect, have underpredicted the dramatic rise in stock prices."
101,"Interestingly, the revisions to estimated trend productivity growth (implying a higher sustainable rate of increase in earnings) have greatly reduced the over-valuation implicit in such models, at least through 1998."
102,Does this pattern of errors suggest a persistent over-valuation in equity prices or is it an indication of a structural break?
103,"Specifically, are there grounds for believing that there has been a significant decline in the equity premium, justifying a higher equilibrium price-earnings ratio?"
104,"Whether the higher equity prices are being driven by structural change (and therefore might be sustainable) or are driven by forces more subject to reversal, they may have a similar effect on aggregate demand and encourage a similar response by monetary policy."
105,I will not (not only because I cannot) resolve the question of whether or not higher equity prices are fully justified by fundamentals.
106,"I have offered two stories to explain the economy's recent exceptional performance--specifically, the combination of robust growth and rising utilization rates and stable to declining inflation."
107,This story focuses on a coincidence of reinforcing relative price shocks that have restrained inflation and allowed the economy to move beyond sustainable limits for a while without inflationary consequences.
108,"The decline in energy prices over 1997 and 1998, the appreciation of the dollar from the spring of 1995 through mid-1998, and the sharp slowing in cost increases for health insurance are the major players in this story."
109,It focuses on structural changes--specifically the decline in the NAIRU and the increase in trend productivity growth--that have enhanced the performance of the economy.
110,"When I first offered these explanations, I noted that neither one alone appeared to do justice to recent experience but that the weights attached to each were still important in designing the appropriate monetary policy response."
111,"Since I first offered these alternative stories, it has become clearer to me that the increase in trend productivity growth has been the star of this episode."
112,It also has become clearer to me that an unexpected improvement in the productivity trend is a development that fits into both the temporary- and permanent-bliss stories.
113,"If it persists, the higher trend productivity will have a profound effect on rising living standards."
114,But a critical question--both for the forecast and for monetary policy--is what are the consequences of a permanent increase in productivity for inflation.
115,Here I draw upon the model of inflation dynamics presented earlier.
116,"First, trend productivity has nothing to do with the rate of inflation in the long run."
117,Inflation is a monetary phenomenon and will be pinned down--for better or worse--by the decisions made about monetary policy.
118,"Second, an unexpected increase in the productivity trend is, as I emphasized earlier, a very powerful favorable supply shock."
119,"The result is a significant and, though temporary, somewhat persistent disinflationary force on the economy."
120,"Overheating still eventually results if the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply for long enough, driving the unemployment rate below the NAIRU."
121,Excess demand in labor markets still ultimately puts upward pressure on nominal compensation.
122,That depends on whether the updrift in trend productivity growth is ongoing or over.
123,"That is, to some degree, unknowable today, although we have some tangible evidence about future productivity (via capital deepening) from the current pace of net investment and the forecast for investment going forward."
124,"But it is quite clear that the other source of supply shocks--the relative price shocks--have all dissipated or reversed, raising the risk of higher inflation going forward."
125,"In addition, it would take a rather large additional increment to productivity growth to prevent the diminishing effect from this source from causing some uptick in inflation."
126,Implications for Monetary Policy So what does all this imply for the conduct of monetary policy?
127,The answer has a critical bearing on the nature of the challenge facing monetary policy.
128,"If the favorable inflation outcome of recent years results importantly from the temporary-bliss story, favorable supply shocks have allowed the economy to move beyond the point of sustainable capacity for a while without inflationary consequences."
129,"If this is correct, as the favorable supply shocks dissipate or reverse, it will not be possible to remain at prevailing utilization rates without inflationary consequences."
130,Either the economy will move to a path of higher inflation or policy will encourage a transition to a more sustainable--though less exceptional--state before the upturn in inflation takes hold or at least before it yields a significant rise in the inflation rate.
131,"If the permanent-bliss story is the greater reason for the favorable inflation outcome, then the role of monetary policy is dramatically different."
132,"We can perhaps best interpret the new-economy argument as an acceptance of the permanent-bliss interpretation of recent experience and, as a result, offering more support than the temporary-bliss argument offers for an accommodating monetary policy."
133,"However, even here, monetary policy would have to be alert both to the effect of a higher productivity trend on demand as well as supply and to the implication of the model that an increase in trend productivity raises the economy's real equilibrium interest rate."
134,"Every year, for example, we forecast slowing growth and rising inflation."
135,Then we spend the coming year trying to explain why we have achieved faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation.
136,But uncertainty about the rate of growth in potential output also has been an important factor in the mismeasurement of the output gap.
137,"Historically, estimates of the NAIRU, the output gap, and trend growth have been revised substantially over time, implying that policymakers often have made decisions based on an assessment of the output gap that later was judged to be seriously incorrect."
138,"First, we should recognize, as I have emphasized earlier, that the NAIRU and trend growth can change, and have changed, over time, and we should be sensitive to the importance of updating our estimates of these parameters in response to incoming data on inflation, unemployment, and other variables."
139,"Second, to the extent that a greater uncertainty remains about the measurement of the output gap, it may be prudent to attenuate the aggressiveness with which real interest rates are adjusted in response to movements in the output gap."
140,"Once the unemployment rate falls far enough below your best estimate of the NAIRU, for example, it would be prudent to return to a more normal responsiveness of interest rates to further declines in the unemployment rate."
141,"In my judgment, we are already in a range in which such a normal response to further declines in the unemployment rate is warranted."
142,"Given the initial conditions of robust growth and high utilization rates, at least with respect to the labor market, and given the clear evidence that the previously favorable price shocks are dissipating or reversing, we cannot, in my view, afford to withdraw entirely from a forward-looking policy that is built on our best estimates of the structure of the economy and inflation dynamics."
143,"While one could interpret recent policy tightenings as a reversal of earlier easings, the fact is that any policy action has to be justified on the basis of how it contributes going forward to achieving the broad macro objectives assigned to monetary policy."
144,"Therefore, for my part, I view the last policy action as an example of still pre-emptive monetary policy, designed to mitigate the risk of higher inflation going forward, especially in light of the threat that robust growth would push already high utilization rates even higher."
145,"I continue to believe that the fundamental challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to a more sustainable, though still excellent, state."
