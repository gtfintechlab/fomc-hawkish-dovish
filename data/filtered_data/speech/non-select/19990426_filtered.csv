0,"First, the role of an international currency and the likelihood that the euro could displace the dollar to some extent over the years ahead; second, the pros and cons associated with having a preeminent international currency; third, the role that the exchange rate plays in monetary policy formulation; and, finally, the implications of the euro for international monetary cooperation."
1,"The consensus seems to be that the euro's depreciation has resulted largely from a slowing in growth relative to expectations in the euro zone, while, at the same time, growth in the U.S. has been stronger than expected."
2,"The macroeconomic factors--the outlook for growth and interest rates--so far have dominated the new currency's movements, just as macroeconomic factors were the driving force behind movements in the euro's chief predecessor currency, the German mark."
3,"The consequences might include a more competitive and healthy euro-wide economy, a greater role for the euro as an international currency, a growing role for euro-denominated assets in global portfolios more generally, and changes in the global pattern of exchange rates and current account balances."
4,Inertia probably explains why it is that until relatively recently a number of traded commodities were quoted and priced in sterling.
5,"By improving price discovery within the euro zone, the euro itself may increase competitiveness across Europe, and thereby benefit low-cost producers, trade competitiveness, and European consumers."
6,"However, this should not lead us to understate or neglect the significant changes in trade flows, current account balances, and exchange rates that might be part of the transition to an increased international role of the euro, and the importance of careful management of this transition."
7,"For example, Federal Reserve policy in the early years of Paul Volcker's chairmanship involved a large increase in short-term interest rates designed to reign-in high domestic inflation."
8,"For countries in Latin America that had borrowed heavily in dollars at floating interest rates, the change in U.S. monetary policy had enormous consequences."
9,"We are the central bank of the U.S. and Congress has given us a quite specific and narrow mandate: promote price stability and full employment at home, period."
10,Some believe that the major benefit from the United States having the premier international currency and the broadest and most liquid financial markets is that we are able to finance our large current account deficit more cheaply than would otherwise be the case.
11,That is true only to the extent that the international status of the dollar brings lower interest rates on dollar liabilities.
12,"This suggests that international currency status might affect a country's (or in the case of the euro, the region's) equilibrium real exchange rate and real interest rate."
13,"But looking at exactly the same phenomenon in another way, those who seek international currency status should not forget that an appreciating currency--and one that is very often a safe haven in times of economic and political crisis--implies a reduction in competitiveness and a drag on economic growth through a declining current account balance."
14,"As the international role of the euro increases, the demand for euros will increase --both directly as currency and indirectly via euro-denominated assets--potentially leading to an appreciation of the euro."
15,"I say potentially because we all know that the price of anything, including the euro, is affected by supply as well as demand."
16,And the euro will encourage an increase in both the issuance of euro-denominated liabilities as well as in the demand for euro-denominated assets.
17,"As a result, there is some uncertainty about the effect of portfolio decisions on the price of the euro."
18,"But let us nevertheless explore the implications of a net increase in the demand for euros and hence an appreciation of the euro over time, given that this is the result many have emphasized and one with particularly important implications for the international financial system."
19,"The effect of a large reallocation of portfolios away from the dollar and dollar-denominated assets and into the euro and euro-denominated assets would, by definition, imply a swing from current account surplus to deficit for the euro area as investors acquire net claims on the region."
20,"Indeed, the appreciation of the euro would be the cause of the euro-area's move from surplus to deficit."
21,I'd like to say a few words about how monetary policymakers think about the exchange rate when judging the appropriate level for domestic short-term interest rates.
22,"For U.S. monetary officials, the dollar through its implications for U.S. net exports and the growth of real GDP as well as for inflation is one of many important economic variables that is input into policymaking."
23,But the Federal Reserve sets its target for the Fed funds rate taking into account all the performance variables in the economy and does not try to target the exchange rate.
24,The depreciation of the euro since its introduction should provide a boost to net exports and put some upward pressure on inflation in the euro zone.
25,"In the United States, we have had a system of flexible exchange rates since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s."
26,"By definition, a flexible exchange rate system is one in which policymakers have complete discretion over monetary policy."
27,"That is, we do not devote monetary policy to the maintenance of a particular value for the exchange rate."
28,"That is the implication of a system in which we retain total flexibility for monetary policy actions in order to best stabilize the domestic economy, of which the international sector is an important component."
29,The importance of maintaining the focus of monetary policy on domestic objectives has clear implications for the suggestion that international monetary cooperation be directed toward the maintenance of target zones for exchange rates.
30,"The importance of maintaining monetary policy focused on domestic objectives, however, rules out, in my view, assigning monetary policy the objective of maintaining exchange rates within target zones."
31,"Frankly, given the volatility of international capital flows, I doubt we could accomplish such an objective even if we assigned monetary policy with the responsibility to enforce such an agreement."
32,"What we should want is a system that permits the United States, the euro area, and Japan to pursue policies to achieve domestic objectives, without generating wide and unsustainable swings in exchange rates."
33,But cyclical swings in exchange rates and trade deficits that naturally arise from cyclical divergences across the countries should neither be avoided nor regretted.
34,These movements are potentially stabilizing and part of the benefits of a flexible exchange rate regime.
35,"Monetary policy responses to cyclical developments tend to reinforce the cyclical swings in exchange rates, and these exchange rate movements are very much part of the stabilizing power of monetary policy."
36,Fiscal policy adjustments allow a country to meet its stabilization objective more by bolstering domestic demand and correspondingly less by encouraging external demand at the expense of other countries.
37,"In addition, in times of global economic stress, relying on cyclical swings in the exchange rates to stabilize individual countries amounts to relying on a redistribution of demand across the countries rather than on policies which raise global demand."
38,Changes in structural fiscal deficits--bringing changes in national saving rates and in relative real interest rates around the world--are a major contributor to non-cyclical swings in exchange rates and current account balances.
39,"Divergent fiscal policies may generate movements in exchange rates and current account balances that are large and unsustainable, subjecting the global economy not only to an inevitable reversal of these movements, but to the threat of a disorderly correction."
40,"More dialogue among the dollar, euro and yen countries might have produced a set of policy mixes across these countries that avoided some of the wider swings in exchange rates that we have witnessed during the past 25 years."
