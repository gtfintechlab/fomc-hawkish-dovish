2,Among the institutions that are most crucial to economic growth are those that enable a country to allocate capital to its most productive uses.
3,"In recent years, the field of economic development has come to the conclusion that ""institutions rule"" and are critical to economic growth.1 An extensive literature focuses on financial development as a significant force driving economic development.2 However, developing good institutions that foster financial development is not easy: It takes time for institutions to evolve and adapt to local circumstances."
4,"When corrupt officials demand bribes, they reduce the incentives for entrepreneurs to make investments."
5,Poor lending policies may cause too much capital to be channeled toward low-return projects and insufficient capital to be directed toward the high-return projects needed to propel income and growth.
6,"Globalizing to Advance Institutional ReformNow that we understand what kinds of institutions are needed to promote financial development and economic growth, letâ€™s turn to the question of how developing countries can improve the likelihood that these institutions are developed."
7,Such inflows can help them achieve reforms that build productivity and wealth that will benefit all their citizens.
8,Globalizing the domestic financial system by opening financial markets to foreigners encourages financial development and growth in wealth in two ways.
9,"Although some of that differential would likely reflect the higher productivity of American workers, capital should, nevertheless, have extremely high returns in such countries, and, in principle, we should expect substantial flows of capital from rich countries (where the returns on capital should be relatively low) to poor countries (where they should be far higher)."
10,"Such capital flows could lead to substantial benefits for poor countries in the form of larger capital stocks, higher productivity, and more rapidly growing incomes."
11,"If they canâ€™t get capital, they wonâ€™t be able to make the investments they need to increase productivity and price their goods competitively."
12,"Accordingly, international trade creates a demand for reforms that will make the financial system more efficient."
13,"Although it has taken time, globalization is helping to generate the demand for an improved financial system, which is driving the reform process."
14,"In August 2006, the National Peopleâ€™s Congress enacted a new bankruptcy law that gives creditors greater protection if a firm goes bankrupt, and last month it approved a law that gives individuals more legal protection for their property.11 China, of course, is an example of a country that has actively encouraged exports as a means of propelling its economic growth and development."
15,"To some extent, China may have gone too far in its use of policy to promote export growth."
16,Increased reliance on market-determined prices will help ensure that the allocation of resources into the export sector does not exceed their efficient use.
17,The goal should be to raise productivity toward world-class standards in all sectors of the economy.
18,Recently Chinaâ€™s authorities have agreed that some rebalancing of the sources of growth away from exports and toward domestic demand is in order.
19,"Among Chinaâ€™s East Asian neighbors, the importance of developing industries to meet demand for domestic uses also is receiving increasing attention."
20,This problem remains especially serious in some African economies and may help explain why their growth performance has been so disappointing.
21,"The most pernicious forms of export taxes are those that are hidden through the governmentâ€™s setting a fixed official exchange rate that artificially keeps the domestic currency at a value well above what it would be worth in terms of foreign currency (say, U.S. dollars) in a free market."
22,"The difference between the official exchange rate and the free, black-market rate (often called the ""black-market premium"") imposes a tax on exporters because they are forced to sell the dollars they earn to the government or to the central bank at the official rate, and thus they receive a much lower price for their goods in terms of the domestic currency."
23,"In 1982 Ghana had a black-market premium of more than 1,000 percent, and so exporters of cocoa (primarily from a tribe different from that of the ruling government party) were getting only 6 percent of the world price."
24,"Other Gains from Trade LiberalizationAlthough we have been focusing on how globalization promotes financial development, we shouldnâ€™t forget that trade globalization, which involves both trade liberalization and an export orientation, is a key driver of economic growth for reasons additional to those already mentioned.12 The first economics course that college students encounter always teaches the concept of comparative advantage: By trading with another country, you can focus your production on what you are really good at so that your productivity will be high."
25,This higher productivity then leads to higher economic welfare.
26,"Trade liberalization, more importantly, promotes competition in domestic markets, which in turn forces domestic firms to increase productivity and make better products, both of which drive economic growth."
27,"If a foreigner produces a better product that can be imported, domestic firms must make a better product at a lower price to keep selling their product at home."
28,"Over the next decade, however, Indian firms boosted their productivity almost to the levels of Taiwanese firms, thereby winning back the domestic market."
29,"Empirical evidence indicates that trade liberalization has positive effects on productivity and economic growth for both importing and exporting countries: It has even been found to be associated with more-rapid increases in life expectancy and a reduction in infant mortality.14 Yet, as is often the case in economics, empirical evidence is never completely clear cut: Some economists question whether the evidence strongly supports a positive link between trade liberalization and growth.15 Nonetheless, the logic of the benefits of trade liberalization and the preponderance of the evidence supporting its positive effects lead most members of the economics profession, including me, to the following conclusion: Trade liberalization is highly beneficial not only for the overall economy but also for its constituent sectors."
30,The resulting economic growth is a rising tide that raises all boats and is an important tool for poverty alleviation.
31,"But even if trade liberalization is not adopted, giving domestic producers the opportunity to sell goods to rich countriesâ€™ markets can be an important engine for growth in the worldâ€™s poorest countries."
32,"Domestic firms have to focus even more on being highly productive, and boosting productivity will lead to rapid economic growth."
33,"Productivity grew, and three decades after World War II, Japan became one of the richest countries in the world."
34,"South Koreaâ€™s development strategy focused on promoting its export sector, and it is the export sector that led to high productivity and economic growth."
35,"Indeed, all examples of successful growth stories in developing economies (China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile) have involved export sectors that met the test of international competition, and some of these economies have also pursued trade liberalization."
36,"In almost all the industrializing East Asian economies, future growth will likely have to follow a more balanced path that relies less on exports and more on production for the domestic market."
37,Only by embracing global markets can developing countries raise living standards.16 Trade liberalization has a critical role to play in economic growth by directly stimulating domestic firms to become more productive.
38,"As we have seen, exporters have strong incentives to be productive so that they can take advantage of access to our markets, and thus they will make the investments needed for growth."
39,"While providing aid to poor countries can, in the right circumstances, help eradicate poverty, it often will not work because it usually does not create the right incentives to promote economic growth."
40,"But as shown in the examples of post-World War II recovery in Europe and Japan, and in the rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s in the newly industrialized economies of Asia, higher standards of living throughout the global economy actually work to our benefit."
41,"And over time, as workersâ€™ productivity abroad rises, so will their wages and incomes."
