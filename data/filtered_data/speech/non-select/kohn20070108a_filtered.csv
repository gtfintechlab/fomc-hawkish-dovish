0,"Over that period, a good deal of the slack in our nation's utilization of resources was taken up, and the unemployment rate reached its lowest level in five years."
1,"At the same time, however, core inflation--that is, inflation without potentially volatile food and energy prices--as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, moved up from less than 1-1/2 percent to about 2-1/2 percent."
2,"To safeguard the gains made over the past quarter century in the achievement of price stability and to promote sustained economic expansion, the Federal Reserve in mid-2004 began removing the considerable monetary accommodation it had earlier put in place."
3,"More recently, led by a sharp pullback in housing activity, economic activity decelerated in the second half of 2006 to a pace that was probably a bit below the long-term rate of growth in our nation's productive capacity."
4,"At the same time, decreases in energy prices have substantially reduced overall consumer price inflation of late, and core inflation has showed signs of slowing."
5,How long will the decline in housing activity hold back overall economic growth?
6,Will the recent good news on inflation persist?
7,"Monetary policy must be based on our best estimate of future developments, and the effectiveness of policy is aided when the public understands the outlook of policymakers."
8,"Second, the views that I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1 Economic ActivityThe deceleration in economic activity in the second half of 2006 was concentrated in the housing and motor vehicle sectors and in the production of related materials and supplies."
9,"Nonetheless, even if the demand for housing is leveling off, housing activity may not yet have found a floor, given the sizable overhang of unsold houses."
10,"It was not triggered by a restrictive monetary policy and high interest rates; indeed, relatively low intermediate and long-term interest rates are helping to support the stabilization of this sector."
11,"But the current contraction in housing did follow an unusually large run-up in sales and construction and, even more so, in prices relative to the returns on other financial and real assets."
12,Our uncertainty about what pushed home prices and sales to those elevated levels raises questions about how the market will adjust now that expectations of the rate of house price appreciation are being trimmed.
13,"And changes in the organization of the construction industry, with activity more concentrated in the hands of large, publicly traded corporations, may also affect the dynamics of prices and activity in response to the inventory overhang."
14,"Although house prices nationally have decelerated noticeably and appear to have fallen in some markets, they are still high relative to rents and interest rates."
15,We also do not know whether the possible stabilization that seems to be taking hold would be immune to a rise in longer-term interest rates should term premiums increase or the federal funds rate fail to follow the downward path currently built into market expectations.
16,"Even if starts stabilize at close to current levels, those levels are sufficiently low that overall construction activity would remain a negative for the growth of economic activity in the first half of this year."
17,"Although much of the weakness in industrial production toward the end of 2006 can be readily traced to the housing and motor vehicle sectors, production in other manufacturing industries also softened from September through November, and this development raised concerns that the deceleration in economic activity was becoming more broadly based."
18,These inventory and production developments may reflect in part a slowing in the growth of business capital spending that has become evident in recent data on orders and shipments of equipment other than high-tech and transportation equipment.
19,A number of indicators continue to suggest that economic activity outside the housing and motor vehicle sectors is likely to post continuing healthy gains over coming quarters.
20,"Prices of many industrial commodities are typically sensitive to developments in the manufacturing sector, and these prices generally remain firm, as is consistent with sustained demand here and abroad."
21,"More broadly, last Friday's employment report suggested no signs of cumulating weakness either in manufacturing or private service-producing industries."
22,And the unemployment rate remained in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent.
23,"Most importantly, the data we have in hand suggest that consumer demand for nonhousing goods and services has been well maintained."
24,Spending and attitudes have been supported over recent months in part by solid gains in household income and employment.
25,"One caution is that some of the recent buoyancy in household attitudes and strength in consumer demand also may reflect the unwinding of earlier increases in gasoline prices, in which case part of the strong gain in spending in recent months may be transitory."
26,"In the wake of the current slowdown in house price gains, I expect that, over time, households will find it necessary to build their net worth by holding back on consumption, and thus, consumer spending will rise a little less rapidly than income for a while."
27,"I do not anticipate that the gap between the growth rates in consumption and income will be large, however, and I believe that the recent data on consumer spending provide some very tentative evidence that the cooling of the housing market will have a limited effect on other forms of spending."
28,Ongoing gains in household consumption and in business capital spending to meet that expected demand and to take advantage of the cost-saving benefits of new technology form the foundation for a moderate pace of economic activity going forward.
29,"To be sure, as I already noted, a low level of housing starts and production adjustments in some manufacturing industries will remain a drag on growth in output in the near term, but these effects will wane during the first half of 2007 as excess inventories are worked off."
30,"When this process is completed, the rate of economic growth should pick up to something in the neighborhood of the growth rate of the economy's potential."
31,InflationI believe that a path for output like the one that I have just described is likely to be associated with a gradual decline in core inflation from the elevated levels of last spring and summer.
32,"Importantly, measures of long-term inflation expectations are no higher than they were before the rise in core inflation."
33,"In addition, some of that earlier price acceleration probably resulted from the pass-through of sharp increases in energy prices in the first half of the year that have been partly reversed; increases in rents and imputed rents for owner-occupied housing may ease back as a portion of the oversupply of homes for sale is shifted into the rental market; and a period of below-trend economic growth should relieve some pressures on labor and product markets."
34,"Certainly, the recent data on consumer prices have been encouragingly consistent with the downward tilt to inflation that the FOMC has been expecting."
35,And we need to recognize that some of the very recent disinflation may represent one-time influences.
36,"Energy costs have moved down markedly in recent months, and those declines have fed through to prices for a number of intermediate goods and probably for some final goods as well."
37,"But futures markets anticipate that prices of crude oil will increase gradually, which suggests that, once the adjustment to the current level plays out, energy prices will no longer work to restrain total and core inflation."
38,"And if a portion of the weakness in goods prices reflects efforts by producers to forestall or correct inventory imbalances, that restraint on pricing will dissipate as firms' corrective actions take effect."
39,"So, despite the recent favorable price data, I believe it is still too early to relax our concerns about whether the run-up in price pressures in the spring and summer of last year is truly unwinding and whether it is unwinding rapidly enough to forestall a pickup in inflation expectations."
40,"Even with the opening of some slack in the manufacturing sector and in homebuilding, labor markets generally seem to have stayed fairly tight, with the unemployment rate at only 4-1/2 percent."
41,Last year's increase in compensation also appears to have outpaced overall consumer price inflation.
42,"That development in and of itself does not necessarily indicate an increase in inflationary pressures, especially if it represents a process in which real compensation begins to catch up with the rapid increases in labor productivity earlier this decade."
43,"What would be problematic would be a pickup in the growth of nominal hourly labor compensation that was passed through to prices over the next several quarters, or one that was not matched, over a sustained period, by a comparable pickup in the growth of productivity."
44,"Eventually, the resulting faster growth of unit labor costs would pose a serious threat to price stability."
45,"Core inflation is still higher than it was just a year ago, and, as I noted, some of the very recent decline may result from one-time changes in relative prices rather than an easing in underlying inflation pressures."
46,"A very gradual decline in the trend rate of inflation continues to be the most likely outcome, but that path is still by no means assured, and in my judgment such a decline remains critically important to the sustained prosperity of the U.S. economy."
