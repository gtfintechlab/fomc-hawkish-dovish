0,"As you know, transparency relates broadly to the openness of a central bank in stating its monetary policy decisions and explaining the reasoning behind them."
1,"To highlight this importance, Otmar Issing, the Bank's chief economist and a member of its Executive Board, characterized communications as the ""hidden pillar"" of the ECB's monetary policy strategy."
2,"Like the Federal Reserve, these central banks announce policy changes after meetings of their monetary policy committees and hold press conferences or publish minutes to explain policy deliberations."
3,They also regularly offer detailed accounts of developments in the economy and provide projections for inflation and economic activity.
4,"The primary task of central banks is to get monetary policy right--that is, to pursue policies that effectively promote the objectives established by their legislatures or parliaments, such as stable prices, full employment, and maximum sustainable growth."
5,"But there is now a broad consensus that central banks should be able to apply their own professional judgment in setting their operational instrument, usually a short-term interest rate."
6,"To be sure, this independence does not refer to the goals of monetary policy."
7,The main reason that central banks need to be independent in using their instruments is that effective monetary policy requires a distant time horizon.
8,The monetary policy most appropriate for long-run stability and growth of an economy may not be politically popular in the short run.
9,The clarity transparency brings to the objectives and strategy of policy can greatly help a central bank explain its decisions in relation to the objectives of long-run price stability and sustainable economic growth.
10,Transparency and Policy Effectiveness The second reason transparency is important is that clarity and predictability of policy decisions may enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
11,"The Federal Reserve controls a very short-term interest rate--the overnight federal funds rate--but, as you know, theory and empirical evidence make clear that longer-term rates matter most for the economy."
12,"Also, less uncertainty about monetary policy might reduce the premium for uncertainty."
13,"Thus, transparency ought to bring the rates that matter most for the macroeconomy into closer alignment with the intentions of monetary policymakers."
14,"The benefits from better communication and greater transparency can also be appreciated by considering the role of credibility and its effects on inflation expectations and, hence, the longer end of the term structure of interest rates."
15,"If the public is unclear about the strategy and objectives of the central bank, the credibility of monetary policy may suffer."
16,"Current economic developments or policy actions directed toward short-run concerns could have an outsized influence on perceptions regarding the more distant future--especially long-run inflation expectations and, therefore, long-term interest rates."
17,"Lack of transparency and lack of credibility, in this sense, could reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy against transitory shocks."
18,"Consider the pickup in inflation that we saw last year, which many economists would attribute at least in part to the temporary effects of increased energy costs."
19,"Had the FOMC not been transparent and credible about its long-run objective of price stability, the public might have raised its perception of long-run inflation as a result of this unfavorable development."
20,"Transparency and credibility about the Federal Reserve's longer-term intentions, however, and the accompanying stability of longer-run inflation expectations, provided greater flexibility in taking action."
21,"To be sure, greater transparency on the part of the central bank does not guarantee that markets will accurately forecast interest rates."
22,"Though a tighter link between monetary policy expectations and long-term interest rates may lessen the need for the central bank to move its policy instrument as much or as quickly, market adjustments are not a substitute for monetary policy action."
23,But being understood can have very different meanings depending on the particular aspects of the monetary policy process one considers.
24,"Certainly, transparency should encompass clear communication of the longer-run objectives and strategy of monetary policy."
25,"In the United States, for example, by law we have objectives for both employment and price stability, neither of which is quantified in statute."
26,"Indeed, in our case, stating a numerical target for the inflation rate of some specific price index, for instance, might not enhance transparency but instead diminish it."
27,"One could argue that, despite the best efforts of government economists and statisticians, inflation measures based on our various price indexes are not sufficiently refined to offer an accurate basis for defining price stability."
28,And we all know that all price indexes can be subjected to outsized influences by special factors that may obscure meaningful underlying trends.
29,"For a variety of reasons, measures of inflation based on various indexes can differ considerably at any point in time."
30,"Thus, in evaluating risks with respect to our price stability objective, I believe that it is preferable to consider all the various measures and not be unduly influenced by a numerical target for any specific index."
31,"Obviously, under these circumstances, changing policy just because a single, specific price index is out of line might not always be sensible, especially if doing so might have detrimental consequences for our other objectives."
32,"For this reason, it seems to me that defining our price stability objective in terms of a numerical target for the rate of inflation of some specific price index could well be problematic."
33,"Indeed, I see considerable advantages to this operating definition of price stability: Price stability is a situation in which economic agents need not take account of expected changes in the general price level in their economic decisionmaking."
34,"In general, when central banks target a short-term interest rate, this aspect of transparency is reasonably easy to implement because an interest rate is easy for financial market participants, members of the legislature, and the general public alike to understand."
35,"And yet, there are instances when quantitative targets may be more informative about the basic intent of policymakers than a short-term interest rate."
36,"For example, when the overnight rate of interest is nearly zero, a monetary policy easing may be rather difficult to communicate in terms of that interest rate."
37,"Investors' ability to make such judgments is enhanced by giving them information about how the central bank sees the probable evolution of the economy in the foreseeable future, in part so that market participants can better judge the likely evolution of monetary policy."
38,Such information helps market participants formulate their own outlook for the economy and monetary policy and therefore their projections of future interest rates and financial asset prices.
39,And it also helps the public put monetary policy action in context so that accountability of the central bank is as informed as possible.
40,"As I mentioned earlier, the most important task of a central bank is to get monetary policy right."
41,"Though these steps clarified the current stance of monetary policy, the Committee recognized that it could further enhance the transparency of its actions by providing timely indications of factors that might influence the future direction of policy."
42,The idea was that providing more information about the Committee's views of the economic outlook would allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the probable future stance of monetary policy.
43,The language indicates the Committee's sense of the balance of risks in the outlook against the background of the Committee's long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.
44,"Specifically, it indicates whether the Committee believes that the risks are ""balanced with respect to prospects for both goals,"" ""weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures,"" or ""weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness."""
45,"By economic weakness, we do not just mean recession; I believe that the Committee would be justified in recognizing risks weighted toward economic weakness if it saw prospects for subpar growth--that is growth below the rate of increase in the economy’s potential."
46,The FOMC has not viewed the issuance of the balance of risks statement as a substitute for needed interest rate changes.
47,"To repeat, the most important task of a central bank is to get monetary policy right."
48,"Since late last year, evidence has accumulated that the economy would be unlikely to meet the Committee’s goal of maximum sustainable noninflationary growth."
49,"Some producers of high-tech equipment may have misjudged the short-term demand for such equipment, perhaps, in part, because they assumed that the strength in investment experienced during 1999 and the early part of 2000 would continue."
50,"Moreover, a number of high-tech companies have failed over the past year, reducing the demand for new investment--both directly through the absence of their own spending and indirectly by increasing the supply of nearly new equipment on the second-hand market."
51,And final demand should be supported by the lower interest rates put in place by the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
52,"Despite the decline in stock prices, I believe that the underlying technical advances that have been so important to macroeconomic developments over the last five years will continue and will provide support over time for business and consumer spending."
53,But what interest rates will be associated with a return to healthy growth in spending remains an open question.
54,"All in all, I think it is too early to have a strong conviction that the economy is reaching the end of this period of quite slow growth."
