0,"It can be a highly volatile component of aggregate demand, with variations in investment often accounting for a good share of the fluctuations in economic activity."
1,"That lesson was demonstrated again in the past decade when strength in business investment contributed to the vigorous expansion of the second half of the 1990s, and then a marked and prolonged weakening in capital spending contributed to recession and sluggish growth in 2001 and 2002. Business investment also has important implications for the supply side of the economy through its influence on the rate of increase in labor productivity and thus the economy's sustainable level of potential output."
2,"But, at the same time, the standard forecast sees growth as being supported by a continued robust expansion of business investment."
3,"In particular, the weakening in investment in 2001 and 2002 was larger and lasted longer than many had anticipated, and although investment growth has picked up in recent years, the level of investment has not fully recovered from the earlier weakness."
4,"Of course, comparisons of these simple ratios and growth rates do not account for other influences on investment in the macroeconomic environment, such as interest rates, the prices of capital goods, or the rate of increase in final spending."
5,"And, despite its ability to predict recent growth rates reasonably well, a dynamic simulation of such a model starting in 2000 indicates that the current level of investment is still considerably lower than expected."
6,"But it was close to zero in 2002 and 2003 and remained unusually low last year (after adjustment for tax-induced flows of repatriated foreign earnings), which suggests that businesses didn't see enough profitable investment projects to warrant tapping the markets for external financing, even at low long-term interest rates."
7,"Euro-area investment has also languished, in part because of relatively slow growth prospects."
8,"In the late 1990s, firms invested in high-tech goods at a very rapid pace, spurred at first by plunging prices and robust business output growth and eventually by an apparently overly optimistic view about the returns on those investments."
9,"This sharp decline, combined with the high depreciation rates on these types of goods, severely curtailed growth of the capital stock, and any overhang seems likely to have been eliminated relatively quickly."
10,Another possibility is that business investment has been held down in recent years because relative prices of capital goods are no longer falling at the same pace at which they declined in the late 1990s.
11,"However, to the extent that these price changes are well measured and our econometric models are well specified, the implications of slower price declines should already be captured by our models."
12,"In addition, the effects of less rapidly falling prices on the growth rate of the user cost of capital appears to have been substantially offset over much of this period by declines in real interest rates."
13,Many periods of recovery have been accompanied by concerns about economic growth and political turmoil.
14,Some have posited that low investment in the United States reflects firms' decisions to meet expanding demand by investing overseas rather than at home.

16,"A slowing in the growth of consumption and residential investment associated with a cooling in the housing market will exert some restraint on capital investment, but business sales should receive some support from improved markets for our exports."
17,The construction data that we have in hand for the first two months of the year suggest a bounceback from the anemic growth in spending on nonresidential buildings that has prevailed over the past few years.
18,"And expenditures on drilling and mining structures are likely to remain strong, given the current market expectations for elevated energy prices."
19,A substantial slowing in these two categories of final demand would likely induce some businesses to curtail or delay investment projects.
20,"In that regard, we do seem to be seeing a strengthening in global demand, which could signal a more pervasive change in attitudes and expectations."
21,"Because capital spending influences not only aggregate demand today but also influences aggregate supply and productivity over the medium term, it is a key element of any forecast."
