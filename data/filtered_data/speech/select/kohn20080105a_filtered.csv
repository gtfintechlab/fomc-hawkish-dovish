0,"And good communication strengthens the effectiveness of good policy, largely because expectations are so important to the choices that households and businesses make about spending and saving and about prices and wages, as well as to the asset prices that help shape those choices."
1,"Enhanced Economic ProjectionsAs already noted, I believe that the additional information in the enhanced projections the FOMC announced in November should be a substantial step forward in increasing public understanding of monetary policy decisions.2 The enhanced projections give more information about the FOMC's medium-term outlook for the economy."
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
3,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run."
4,"In addition, FOMC participants' projections of growth and unemployment in the third year of their forecasts will be influenced significantly by their interpretation of maximum sustainable growth and resource utilization, given their understanding of the likely growth of productivity and structure of labor markets."
5,And our projections for inflation in year three will depend importantly on our sense of what inflation rate is consistent with our mandates for employment and price stability.
6,"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes."
7,"Over time, as actual inflation tends toward the year-three forecasts, inflation expectations may well become even more firmly anchored than they are today."
8,"In another change, the Committee included total consumer inflation in its forecasts along with the core measure it had been using."
9,"We have always recognized that ""price stability"" was not intended to apply to a subset of prices that people paid."
10,"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time."
11,"Hence, core inflation has been the most useful guide to the factors affecting policy when our forecast horizon was relatively short."
12,"FOMC members will be making their forecasts quarterly, thereby adding two rounds to the semiannual forecasts keyed to our monetary policy reports and Chairman Bernanke's testimonies."
13,"As noted previously, our longer-term forecasts of inflation are presumably influenced by our individual assessments of what inflation rate would be acceptable and consistent with fulfilling our congressional mandates, but we chose not to ask each participant for an explicit numerical definition of price stability."
14,We believed that the steps we were taking would provide additional information that could help clarify how we viewed price stability that at the same time would allow us to remain consistent with giving information about how we expected to fulfill our dual mandate.
15,I expect that our new projections will provide some of the benefits of an explicit target in better anchoring inflation expectations while not giving up any flexibility to react to developments that threaten high employment.
16,"As we gain experience with the enhanced forecasts, we will continue to evaluate how best to promote stability of both prices and employment."
17,"When FOMC participants make their forecasts, each individual assumes ""appropriate"" monetary policy--that is, the policy that is most likely to foster the achievement of our objectives."
18,"Forecasts made under such an assumption should better reveal the participants' views of the underlying structural parameters of the economy--the best possible tradeoffs between inflation and output stability in the short run and longer-term price and output trends--than would be made assuming an externally derived path for rates, such as the path implicit in market interest rates."
19,"Every episode of financial turmoil is different, which greatly complicates the analysis of how the financial situation is likely to evolve in the current circumstances, how lenders and borrowers might react, and how spending and prices could be affected."
