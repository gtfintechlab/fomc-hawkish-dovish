0,"I hope that you will conclude from this discussion that, though the process of setting monetary policy is complex, it is nonetheless in many important ways accessible to the average citizen."
1,"The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the most important monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy."
3,"Generally, an announcement of a change in interest rates, if any, is made at about 2:15 in the afternoon."
4,Let me turn now to a discussion of monetary policy and the outlook for the U.S. economy.
5,The Goals of Monetary Policy Federal law establishes the goals of monetary policy.
6,"The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
7,"Many analysts believe that achieving price stability should be the primary goal of a central bank because a stable level of prices appears to be the condition most conducive to maximum sustained output and employment, and to moderate long-term interest rates."
8,"This presumably is because in times of price stability the prices of goods, materials and services are undistorted by inflation and thus can serve as clearer signals and guides for the efficient allocation of resources."
9,"Also, a background of stable prices is thought to encourage capital formation because it reduces the distortion created by a tax system that is only partly indexed for inflation."
10,Some would argue that the remarkable period of growth that we are experiencing is due in no small measure to the low rate of inflation that has prevailed for some time.
11,"In the long run, I have no doubt that price stability underpins efforts to achieve maximum output and employment."
12,"But, in the short run, some tensions can arise between efforts to reduce inflation and efforts to maximize employment and output."
13,"For example, the economy may at times be faced with adverse developments affecting supply, such as a bad agricultural harvest or a disruption in the supply of oil, which put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on output and employment."
14,"In these circumstances, makers of monetary policy must decide the extent to which we should focus on defusing price pressures or on cushioning the loss of output and employment in the short run, in the context of our long-term objectives."
15,"At other times, policymakers may be concerned that expectations of inflation will get built into decisions about wages and prices, become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and result in temporary losses of output and employment."
16,Countering this threat of inflation with a more restrictive monetary policy could risk small losses of output and employment in the short run but might make it possible to avoid larger losses later should expectations of higher inflation become embedded in the economy.
17,"These labels are an effort to simplify, in fact, oversimplify, the complex choices that each member of the FOMC must make in deciding how to trade off the risk that action, or inaction, on our part will lead to inflation heating up to unacceptable levels, as opposed to having an inadequate creation of jobs."
18,But I believe that all members of the Committee recognize that the major contribution the Federal Reserve can make to higher standards of living over time is to promote price stability.
19,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on growth and employment, while of course it has an immediate impact on financial markets."
20,"Because of the long time frame for effect on the real economy, I believe that it is important for policy to look ahead one to two years as it aims at promoting stable prices and a sustainable GDP growth path, along which the economy is at full potential."
21,"Given that we need to be forward-looking, or ""preemptive,"" as it is often put, one potentially important element in making monetary policy is the forecast or likely outlook for economic growth, unemployment and the price level for the next year or two."
22,"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts."
23,"To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable."
24,"As one example, the failure of price inflation to pickup as labor markets have become tighter is not consistent with older empirical observations."
25,"Moreover, factors outside of economists' models have provided some surprises, such as the Asian economic and financial turmoil and the collapse of oil prices."
26,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed."
27,"Some of the variables relevant in this regard are: 1) the level of unemployment and the rate of job creation, 2) the rate of change in wages or prices or early signs of emerging inflation, 3) the rate and composition of GDP growth (inventory, trade flows, consumption, investment, residential and commercial construction, etc."
28,"Another set of variables to be considered in making monetary policy are financial variables, such as money supply, interest rates, exchange rates, credit flows, and conditions in bank lending or in the debt and equity markets."
29,"The last two years, 1997 and 1998, gave an interesting case study of the interplay between these different variables and the degree of forward-looking behavior in the making of monetary policy."
30,"From March of 1997 through much of 1998, pleasant surprises in the performance of inflation and the general absence of early signs of inflation, and uncertainty about the relationship of inflation to changes in the level of production, kept the FOMC from tightening."
31,We did not tighten despite the economy being beyond most estimates of its potential and despite many forecasts of rising inflation.
32,"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so."
33,"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all."
34,"Under those circumstances, the FOMC thought it appropriate to ease to offset a likely significant impact on future domestic spending and growth."
35,"Finally, no discussion of monetary policy and financial markets would be complete without reference to the equity markets."
36,"Therefore, equity prices have an influence on business fixed investment, along with consumption, the major drivers of our economy."
37,We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that impair real economic activity.
38,These are just some of the factors that might go into making monetary policy.
39,"Outlook for 1999 With this general statement of the factors that go into setting monetary policy, let me turn to the outlook for 1999."
40,It now appears to many forecasters that real GDP growth for 1998 was 3.5 percent or more on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis.
41,"The consensus, as represented by the most recent Blue Chip Economic Indicators, is that real growth in 1999 will moderate, perhaps to slightly over 2 percent, again on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth quarter basis (nearly 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis)."
42,"This consensus outlook, if accurate, would eventually produce a ""soft landing"" with growth near the economy's potential and inflation remaining low."
43,"I should also note that this is a repeat of earlier forecasts that growth will moderate, and the economy has surprised many forecasters with its resilience."
44,"Rising stock prices continue to point to strong consumer demand, but valuations are high by historical standards and one wonders whether this stimulus will remain so strong."
45,"At the same time, U.S. inflation has been contained, at least until recently, by a number of factors, such as a rising exchange rate for the U.S. dollar through much of last year, well-contained health care costs, and declining prices for oil and other commodities, which may prove to be short-lived."
46,"The ability of businesses to pass on price increases has been constrained, in part, by international competition."
47,Will the special factors I mentioned above continue to mitigate inflationary pressures arising from labor markets?
48,"Are there other, longer-term forces at work damping price pressures that we have not yet identified?"
49,"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed."
50,"We observe consumption, investment and labor market decisions and try to adjust monetary policy to the signals that we receive so that our nation's economic welfare is not threatened by inflation or by growth that is below the economy's potential."
