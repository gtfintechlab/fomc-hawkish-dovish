0,"It is the job of traders and investors to read our intentions from the public record, form their own judgments as to the course of economic activity and inflation that are based on, in addition to monetary policy, current and prospective fiscal policies and demand and supply shocks, and translate all that into action as expressed in the prices of a bewildering array of debt, equity, and derivative instruments."
1,"Sometimes, believe it or not, they turn out to complicate, rather than advance, the cause of monetary policy."
2,"Because many of the instruments in which you deal have long maturities, the judgments that have to be made to price them by necessity stretch well into the future."
3,"Thus, the policy easings of 1991 and 1992 were greeted with some skepticism as market participants apparently interpreted those actions as reflecting a lessened concern about inflation on the part of the Federal Reserve, rather than the appropriate response to a softening in aggregate demand."
4,The spread between long and short-term rates is often viewed as one of the most reliable cyclical indicators and a widening as a measure of the increased stimulus of monetary policy.
5,But I viewed the widening in this episode as evidence of the reduced effectiveness of monetary policy in an environment where actions by bond-market participants were preventing long-term interest rates from adjusting in response to the policy-induced decline in short-term rates.
6,"But in the interim, monetary policy's intentions were blunted by the market's misreading of the economy."
7,"Thus, market prices tend to extrapolate that changes in monetary policy cluster in the same direction."
8,"By mid-1994, the FOMC had substantially raised its intended federal funds rate, but market prices seemed to say that enough was not enough."
9,"In retrospect, a tighter focus on fundamentals -- that policy was acting in a pre-emptive fashion to contain inflation, rather than an extrapolation of the sequence of recent policy actions -- would have helped to cap the rise in longer-term yields."
10,"For that reason, policymakers are well advised to heed the message from markets that are expressed in prices."
11,"What I find most intriguing is the notion that markets can carry some, and, in the extreme view, all of the load for monetary policymakers."
12,"Because of the inclusiveness of the market, a broad assortment of views about the workings of the economy can be reflected in prices."
13,"While the design of the FOMC fosters a similar diversity of views, virtually nonstop market trading allows prices to move before official policymakers can react."
14,"In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity."
15,"Indeed, in those circumstances, the Federal Reserve would have to weigh carefully the effects on long rates of both the current and lagged levels of short rates so as to avoid the potential for an overshooting of short-term interest rates that would have adverse consequences for the economy."
16,"Thus, for the same reasons the Federal Reserve attempts to be pre-emptive in its monetary policy decisions, we would welcome pre-emptive pricing by market participants."
17,"If the prices are right, we will act to validate them."
18,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.
19,"By arm's length, I mean that the information markets provide works best as an independent check on monetary policy decisions."
20,"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy."
21,"My fellow governors and I routinely receive from our staff a translation of the term structure of Treasury yields into implied forward rates, volatility inferred from options prices, and paths for expected monetary policy action consistent with futures prices."
22,"Of late, the information we receive has included inferences drawn from quotes on the Treasury's inflation protected securities."
23,"But even after we have reliable quotes on a more complete indexed term structure, considerable analysis must still be done before we can cull readings of inflation expectations and inflation risk from market prices."
24,"As you well appreciate, the spread of the yield on a nominal instrument over its inflation-protected counterpart includes compensation for expected inflation, inflation uncertainty, and differential risk characteristics."
25,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates."
26,This innovation has made the technical job of implementing monetary policy from day to day more difficult.
27,"Simply, reserve requirements are no longer necessarily the binding determinant of reserve demand for many banks."
28,"However, when desired clearing balances dictate short-run movements in the demand for reserves, the reserve market, and therefore the federal funds rate, may become a bit more volatile late in the trading day."
