0,"The motivation for granting independence to central banks is to insulate the conduct of monetary policy from political interference, especially interference motivated by the pressures of elections to deliver short-term gains irrespective of longer-term costs."
1,"The intent of this insulation is not to free the central bank to pursue whatever policy it prefers--indeed every country specifies the goals of policy to some degree--but to provide a credible commitment of the government, through its central bank, to achieve those goals, especially price stability."
2,The history of the Federal Reserve's relationship to the rest of government is one marked by efforts by the rest of government both to foster central bank independence and to exert political pressure on monetary policy.
3,"If a central bank is free to set the final objectives for monetary policy, it has goal independence."
4,"However, countries vary considerably in the specificity of the mandated goals and hence in the degree of discretion of central banks in the conduct of monetary policy."
5,This phenomenon has been called the political business cycle in which pre-election stimulus leads to higher inflation followed by monetary restraint after the election.
6,"On the other hand, it appears that elected officials in many countries apparently understood the incentives under which they operate and have structured charters for their central banks that, in effect, tie their own hands--that is, limit political interference with monetary policy to enhance the prospects of achieving and maintaining price stability."
7,"In addition, budget priorities and monetary policy objectives can be in conflict."
8,"The executive branch generally wants to keep the cost of servicing its debt low, and this preference might be at odds with the need for monetary policy to vary interest rates to maintain price stability."
9,"Finally, especially in countries where debt markets are not well developed, central banks might be called upon to finance budget deficits by printing money, again interfering with maintaining price stability."
10,Some have worried that even an independent central bank could succumb to the temptation to stimulate the economy today at the expense of higher inflation in the future.
11,"That is, the central bank has an incentive to commit itself to price stability and then to renege on this promise in order to gain employment in the short run with relatively little initial sacrifice in the form of higher inflation."
12,In the long run inflation would rise and the central bank would either have to tolerate the higher rate of inflation or push output below potential for a while to restore price stability.
13,"Once the public understood this process, moreover, it would expect higher inflation, so that, in the longer run, the result could be higher inflation without any short-run gain in output."
14,"The rule would ensure a credible commitment to price stability, thereby anchoring the public's expectations and removing the inflationary bias that otherwise might result."
15,"Second, the government could appoint conservative central bankers--central bankers with a greater commitment to price stability than the public--and thereby offset the inflationary bias that would otherwise arise."
16,"Third, central bankers could be forced to operate under performance or incentive contracts, whereby they could be penalized for failure to maintain price stability."
17,The Governor of the Bank of New Zealand operates under such a performance contract; he can be removed from office for failure to achieve his inflation target.
18,They will therefore be reluctant to undermine their credibility over the longer run by pretending to pursue price stability while stimulating the economy for short-run gain.
19,"Still, the problem highlighted in the time inconsistency literature may reinforce the case for both a price stability legislative mandate and instrument independence for the central bank."
20,Independence also is likely to reinforce the credibility of a central bank's commitment to price stability.
21,"First, it could allow the central bank to reduce the cost of lowering inflation."
22,"It is generally agreed that to lower inflation monetary policy must reduce output for a while, relative to potential, by reducing aggregate demand."
23,The resulting loss of output during the transition to lower inflation is a measure of the cost of reducing inflation.
24,"The more quickly inflation expectations fall, the more rapidly will inflation itself decline, and the lower will be the cost of reducing inflation."
25,"If aggregate demand were to slow, a stimulative monetary policy move would be less likely to undermine confidence in the central bank's pursuit of price stability when the central bank is independent (and has a price stability mandate)."
26,"In addition, if inflation moved upward, inflation expectations would be less likely to follow immediately, making it easier for the central bank to contain inflation."
27,"The empirical studies generally find an inverse relationship between measures of central bank independence and both average inflation and variability of inflation, at least for developed economies."
28,The inverse relationship could also reflect the fact that countries with less aversion to inflation might be less likely to have independent central banks.
29,"In addition, there is no consistent evidence of a relationship between central bank independence and real economic activity nor consistent evidence that central bank independence lowers the cost of reducing inflation or increases the effectiveness of stabilization policy."
30,"Recently, the Ministry of Finance indeed asked the policy committee of the Bank of Japan to delay a decision to raise the Bank's target interest rate."
31,"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999."
32,The European Parliament carries out oversight hearings on monetary policy but does not have any authority with respect to the ECB.
33,"Independence and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, was established as an independent central bank--although, at the time, it was given no clear concept of its role in the conduct of monetary policy."
34,"During the first half century of Federal Reserve history, the Congress continued to focus more on issues involving the structure of the Federal Reserve than on providing a clear legislative mandate for monetary policy or oversight of the conduct of monetary policy."
35,"A former Fed governor, Andrew Brimmer, in a 1989 paper entitled ""Politics and Monetary Policy: Presidential Efforts to Control the Federal Reserve,"" describes the record of almost ""continuous and at least public and vigorous conflicts"" between Presidents and the Federal Reserve."
36,"In his view, twelve of the fourteen Presidents between the founding of the Federal Reserve and the time he was writing--from Woodrow Wilson to George Bush--had ""some kind of public debate, conflict, or criticism of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" the exceptions being Calvin Coolidge and Gerald Ford."
37,"He alleged that Presidents resented the delegation of monetary policy by the Congress to an independent Federal Reserve and sought ways to bring monetary policy under their influence, often by exerting direct political pressure on the Federal Reserve, but principally through the appointment process."
38,"Thomas M. Havrilesky, in a 1992 book, also provides an account of, and some attempts to measure, the intensity of political pressure over time, based on the number of comments on monetary policy made by Administration officials, including the President, and by members of the Congress."
39,But to my knowledge the Administration has never made any public or private effort to influence monetary policy.
40,"The Administration wanted to shift the power over monetary policy toward the centralized and presidentially appointed Federal Reserve Board governors, a group they had a better opportunity to influence through the appointment process."
41,"During both World Wars, Treasury wanted to issue securities at low interest rates to ease the burden of financing and the Fed went along because it felt bound to facilitate wartime financing."
42,"After World War I, the Treasury opposed raising the discount rate to combat inflation, but the Fed did so anyway."
43,"After the war, the Fed wanted to resume an independent monetary policy, fearing that it would otherwise become an engine of inflation, but the Treasury was still concerned about minimizing the service cost of the debt."
44,"Under the terms of the Accord, as it came to be known, the Fed was no longer obligated to peg the interest rates on Treasury debt, but it was agreed that active consultation between the Fed and Treasury would continue."
45,"From the end of World War II until the mid-1970s, the mandate for monetary policy was based on the Employment Act of 1946."
46,"The act identified the government's macroeconomic policy objectives as fostering ""conditions under which there will be useful employment opportunitiesâ€¦for those able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power."""
47,President Johnson did not want the Administration's stimulative fiscal policy undermined by restrictive monetary policy.
48,Chairman Martin supported an increase in the discount rate as an appropriate step to contain the risk of higher inflation.
49,The Congress became more involved in the monetary policy process in the 1970s.
50,"This was a response to both poor economic performance and changing views about the importance of monetary aggregates in shaping economic developments, especially inflation."
51,Inflation began to rise in the late 1960s and escalated further in the 1970s.
52,"During this period, monetarism was an increasing influence, with its focus on the importance of limiting the rate of growth of the money supply to control inflation."
53,But it was the sharp recession in 1974-75 that really provoked the Congress to provide more detailed instructions to the Federal Reserve about the objectives that should guide monetary policy.
54,"In 1975, the House and Senate passed Concurrent Resolution 133 calling on the Fed to lower long-term interest rates and expand the monetary and credit aggregates to promote recovery."
55,The Fed was also instructed to set money growth targets and to participate in periodic congressional hearings on monetary policy.
56,"For the first time, the Congress explicitly identified the objectives for monetary policy."
57,"Still, with its focus on the conduct of monetary policy at a point in time (rather than on general guidelines on policy objectives to be applied over time), the resolution was a clear instance of action by the Congress to intervene and influence monetary policy."
58,"The monetary policy objectives written into the concurrent resolution were added by an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 and were further elaborated in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, often referred to as the Humphrey Hawkins act after its co-sponsors."
59,Another clear attempt at political interference emerged in February 1988 when an undersecretary of the Treasury sent a letter to Federal Reserve officials urging them to ease monetary policy.
60,"As a result, the Congress is now reconsidering the monetary policy oversight process."
61,"In part because the link between money growth and nominal spending appears to be less tight than it was earlier, the role of money growth in monetary policy deliberations has diminished and it appears likely that the Congress will no longer require the Fed to set and report money growth ranges."
62,"However, the current language about the objectives of monetary policy seems likely to be retained, as does semiannual testimony on monetary policy."
63,"The legislation creating an ""independent"" central bank--or in many cases revisions to such legislation--often entirely takes away goal independence by mandating objectives for monetary policy, but otherwise sets up a structure that confers and protects instrument independence."
64,The most important requirement for instrument independence is that the central bank be the final authority on monetary policy.
65,"That is, monetary policy decisions should not be subject to veto by the executive or legislative branches of government."
66,Instrument independence is further protected if other institutions of government are not represented on the monetary policy committee.
67,"Instrument independence is further facilitated by long, overlapping terms for members of the monetary policy committee; by limited opportunities for reappointment; and by committee members not being subject to removal except for cause--where ""cause"" refers to fraud or other personal misconduct but explicitly excludes differences in judgment about policy."
68,"As I noted above, the Treasury or Finance Ministry will have an incentive to keep interest rates low to reduce the cost of servicing the government debt."
69,"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government."
70,"Independence, by this definition, is viewed as greatest if price stability is the exclusive objective of monetary policy, or at least the principal objective."
71,"Empirical Studies of the Relative Independence of CentralBanks Studies of the economic consequences of central bank independence typically estimate the economic effects by first deriving quantitative measures of the relative independence of central banks and then estimating how this measure is correlated with average inflation, inflation variability, and real economic performance."
72,"Grilli, Masciandro, and Tabellini (1991) also incorporated information on the length of terms of monetary policy committee members and on policy goals of the central bank with respect to monetary policy, specifically whether there is a mandate for monetary stability (including money growth or price stability objectives)."
73,The Federal Reserve lost points in these rankings because of the brevity of the Chairman's term (less than five years) and the failure to single out price stability as the unique or principal objective.
74,"Grilli, Masciandro, and Tabellini and Cukierman also included in their measures the nature of monetary policy objectives, ranking independence higher if there is a price stability objective and, in Cukierman's case, higher still if price stability is the only or at least principal objective."
75,"In the latter case, a central bank with more discretion--for example, as a result of multiple objectives, as in the case of the United States--is ranked as less independent than a central bank that has little discretion on account of a single, precisely defined price stability objective."
76,"Of course, defining independence to involve a mandate making price stability the single or principal objective increases the potential for an inverse relationship between ""independence"" and inflation."
77,But accountability is the critical mechanism for ensuring both that the central bank is operated in a way consistent with democratic ideals and that the central bank operates under incentives to meet its legislative mandate for monetary policy.
78,Two aspects of designing the objectives for monetary policy are important.
79,"First, a single objective (typically price stability) makes the central bank more accountable, because multiple targets always carry trade-offs, at least in the short-run, which are subject to the discretion of the central bank."
80,"Specifically, an explicit numerical inflation target makes the central bank more accountable than a more general commitment to price stability."
81,"First, if there is a single target for a central bank, it will surely be price stability, given that monetary policy is the principal, even unique, determinant of inflation in the long run."
82,"Indeed, given the inescapable trade-off between inflation variability and output variability, a central bank naturally, even inevitably, accounts for the variability of output around full employment when deciding how rapidly to try to restore price stability in cases where shocks or policy mistakes move the economy away from this goal."
83,"Inflation-targeting central banks often take account of output variability by defining a period of time over which any return to price stability should occur, typically two years."
84,"In addition, they provide an important opportunity for the President to try to influence monetary policy decisions by pressures exerted on the Chairman subsequent to appointment."
85,"On the other hand, the long and effectively nonrenewable terms for governors would protect the fundamental independence of monetary policy."
86,"With respect to monetary policy, it refers to the immediacy with which the public learns of policy decisions and the amount of information provided about the rationale for policy actions and the assessment of how possible future developments bear on policy."
87,"The Congress has, over time, made efforts to increase the transparency of the monetary policy process and widen the scope of disclosures of monetary policy decisions and of the discussions leading up to those decisions."
88,Transparency is influenced by the operating procedures used to implement monetary policy.
89,"This was a very imprecise way of setting and explaining policy, making it more difficult for the public and the Congress to monitor and evaluate monetary policy decisions."
90,"The effect of monetary policy derives not only from the explicit policy actions taken, but also from expectations about future policy."
91,"When the Congress learned of the availability of the transcripts, they demanded that they be released to the public, and the current procedures were negotiated between the Federal Reserve and the Congress."
92,The transcripts are a useful historical record of FOMC meetings and provide scholars as well as current Board members with insights into the monetary policy process and its evolution over time.
93,"The executive and legislative branches collectively set fiscal policy, while the central bank sets monetary policy."
94,The appropriate monetary policy must give substantial weight to prevailing and expected fiscal policies.
95,I say to a lesser extent because I believe fiscal policies since the early 1980s have been set more on the basis of longer-run considerations--such as promoting growth--than for short-run stabilization purposes.
96,"The forecast of the central bank must consider current and prospective fiscal policies, and monetary policy must adjust to fiscal policy changes, while the executive and legislative branches are somewhat freer to implement changes in long-run strategies as the political consensus allows or dictates."
97,"On the other hand, the absence of active stabilization efforts by the executive branch (and the Congress) might increase their frustration about the stabilization policies pursued by the Federal Reserve--or perhaps more likely at the perceived failure of the Federal Reserve to pursue full employment aggressively enough--and increase efforts at political interference with the conduct of monetary policy."
98,The Eisenhower Administration established an Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stabilization (ABEGS) which included the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Fed Chairman--initially Arthur Burns and William McChesney Martin respectively--plus cabinet members.
99,"During that period, fiscal policy had a more prominent role in stabilization policy, with monetary policy playing a more supporting role."
100,This was the most dramatic example of attempted political interference with the conduct of monetary policy after the 1951 Accord.
101,"This change reflects the smaller role of fiscal policy in stabilization ever since the early 1980s, when the Reagan Administration shifted the focus to longer-run issues related to encouraging more rapid trend growth."
102,"Stabilization policy since that time has been dominated by the Federal Reserve, with coordination of policies becoming especially important at major turning points in the thrust of fiscal policy--for example, when the Clinton Administration decided to make a reduction in the structural federal budget deficit the centerpiece of its economic policy strategy in 1993."
103,"Given the Treasury's respect for the independence of the Fed, participants will rarely discuss monetary policy, although they occasionally touch on the economic outlook."
104,"Once again, discussions of the economic outlook and monetary policy are rare."
105,"But the discussions often involve interesting issues related to the outlook, such as the sources of the increases in productivity growth and why most other countries have not benefited significantly thus far from the same developments."
106,"This power is a rather blunt instrument, providing ample opportunity for the Federal Reserve to take advantage of its independence in the conduct of monetary policy."
107,"At the same time, it ensures that the Federal Reserve is extremely respectful of the oversight authority of the Congress and provides some leverage for congressional influence on the conduct of monetary policy."
108,It is sometimes difficult to separate direct political involvement in monetary policy from essential congressional oversight of monetary policy.
109,"Today it seems out of place for the Administration to comment directly on the conduct of monetary policy, though this may reflect the extraordinary relationship between this Administration and the Federal Reserve and the exceptional economic environment of the last several years."
110,"At any rate, for the present, the relationship between the Administration and the Federal Reserve on monetary policy is confined to the President's making appointments to the Board while the members of the administration and the Board (and especially the Chairman and the Secretary of the Treasury) engage in regular but informal consultations."
111,"On the other hand, the Congress cannot fulfill its oversight responsibilities without actively engaging the Federal Reserve in a dialogue about the conduct of monetary policy."
112,"The Congress conveys its views on monetary policy through a variety of vehicles, including letters, speeches, statements and questions at hearings, committee reports on monetary policy, and bills and resolutions."
113,The Congress over the years has used a variety of approaches to influence monetary policy.
114,"Perhaps most important, the Congress has set the goals for monetary policy in law."
115,"The Congress can, if it decides, pass legislation that directly requires a specific monetary policy action."
116,"The Congress can threaten to change the structure of the Federal Reserve--abolish the Federal Reserve at the extreme, or specify particular qualifications for Board members, or alter the composition of the FOMC--in an attempt to influence monetary policy."
117,"The Congress can demand an accounting of policy by summoning the Chairman, Board members, and Reserve Bank presidents to congressional hearings, in addition to the formal semiannual testimonies by the Chairman."
118,"The line between oversight and direct involvement in the conduct of policy is perhaps crossed when the Congress passes or even introduces a resolution or legislation that gives specific direction to raise or lower interest rates and, especially, when such directions are accompanied by proposed legislation that would reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve."
119,"The history of the past twenty years shows that members of the Congress do try to influence monetary policy, especially when the economy is performing poorly or when interest rates are high or rising, but that the Congress has rarely gone so far as to pass legislation to direct policy."
120,"Indeed, the introduction of such legislative mandates may be thought of as one way the Congress tries to persuade the Federal Reserve to alter its conduct of monetary policy."
121,"There are, to my knowledge, only one or two examples of legislation that passed with specific monetary policy directives and thus compromised the delegation of instrument independence to the Federal Reserve."
122,"At the end of November 1982, forty-two Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling on the Fed to ""achieve low enough interest rates to generate significant economic growth and thereby reduce the current intolerable level of unemployment."""
123,"However, the final language in the continuing resolution included an important qualification that, in effect, left the discretion about the conduct of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve."
124,"Specifically, the Congress added the qualifying phrase ""with due regard for combating inflation."""
125,"Second, we have to accept a certain amount of grumbling about the decisions that impose short-run costs, especially when unemployment is high or policy tightens preemptively to contain what the Fed perceives as inflation risks."
126,"When the President and congressional majority are from different parties, party politics can affect the Federal Reserve and may explain, in part, why today the Board has two vacancies plus a governor who is serving after the expiration of his term (since a governor can continue to serve in such a case until reappointed or until a new governor is appointed and confirmed).3 In recent years, delayed action on nominations for governor or renomination as chairman, has served as a vehicle for some Senators to express displeasure with the conduct of monetary policy.4 Another important relationship with the Congress is through hearings."
127,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy."
128,Typically the Chairman alone testifies on monetary policy.
129,"The most important testimony on monetary policy is delivered at semiannual hearings before the House and the Senate that began, as I mentioned, with the now-expired provisions of the Humphrey-Hawkins act."
130,"These meetings are rarely about monetary policy and most focus on regulatory issues, including banking bills and the Community Reinvestment Act, but they are also sometimes about global economic developments, international financial crises, or international financial architecture issues."
131,"Finally, members of the Congress often write letters to the Board--individually and in groups--typically urging a specific direction for monetary policy."
132,"Since joining the Board in June 1996, I have seen numerous such letters--all either expressing concern about high interest rates or, in most cases, urging the FOMC either to not raise interest rates or to lower them."
133,"The largest number of signers during this period was eighty, for a September 23, 1996 letter urging the FOMC not to raise interest rates."
134,"These letters are perhaps best understood as attempts by the Congress to alert the Fed to the pain of constituents as a byproduct of the conduct of monetary policy--typically when the Fed is preemptively raising interest rates in an effort to prevent higher inflation or trying to unwind an earlier increase in inflation, or not sufficiently stimulating a sluggish economy."
135,"Once having admonished us in an effort to make sure we understood the consequences of our policies, the Congress has generally relied on us to balance inflation and stabilization objectives, as is the implicit contract under a regime under which the Congress has delegated instrument independence to the Federal Reserve."
136,There has long been a small group in the Congress who would like to revise the language related to the policy mandate to elevate the role of price stability to the single or at least principal objective for monetary policy.
137,They press this issue not out of dissatisfaction with the conduct of monetary policy but because they believe such a revised policy mandate would strengthen the credibility of the Federal Reserve's commitment to price stability and thereby allow the central bank to carry out this commitment in the most efficient way.
138,"However, a larger, if less vocal, group in the Congress strongly opposes abandoning a commitment by the Federal Reserve to promote full employment through its conduct of monetary policy."
139,"The mandate, for example, sets out full employment and price stability as objectives but leaves to the Federal Reserve the precise definition of those goals."
140,"As recent experience confirms, it would be difficult and unwise to set any numerical target for full employment, given the uncertainty about what that target should be and the likelihood that this target would vary over time with demographic changes in the labor force, government policies, and changes in the efficiency of the matching process between jobs and unemployed workers."
141,The Federal Reserve has never set an explicit numerical target for inflation.
142,Chairman Greenspan has defined price stability as inflation so low and stable that it no longer affects the decisions of households and businesses.
