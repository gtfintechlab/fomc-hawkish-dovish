0,I will ask and answer two sets of questions--the first related to the economic outlook and the second to the strategy for monetary policy.
1,"In each case, I will focus on the implications for the conduct of current monetary policy."
2,Has there been an upturn in productivity growth?
3,"What we can confidently say is that, since late 1995, actual productivity growth has increased and, indeed, moved still higher at the end of 1998 and through early 1999."
4,"In addition, this improvement cannot be fully accounted for as a normal cyclical improvement because productivity growth increased further after GDP growth stabilized at about 4 percent."
5,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.
6,"In addition, the recent improved productivity performance is even more remarkable, given that the decline in the unemployment rate to almost a 30-year low might have been expected to result in employment of lower-skilled and hence less-productive workers."
7,"Before discussing possible sources and implications of this development, let me clarify what I mean by trend productivity growth."
8,"First, I use it to refer to the maximum sustainable rate of growth in productivity, once the economy has reached capacity."
9,"Looking backward, it can be measured by de-cycling actual productivity growth or by computing actual productivity growth over periods long enough to wash out the effect of the business cycle."
10,"Extrapolating the trend rate forward, it is the rate of actual productivity growth that would be expected if the economy remained at full employment."
11,"Trend productivity growth has varied widely over the postwar period, from more than 3 percent in the 1960s to close to 1 percent in the decade preceding this expansion."
12,"Because actual productivity is highly pro-cyclical and because there is considerable noise in quarterly observations, it is not easy to discern immediately changes in the underlying trend."
13,This analytical problem has been further complicated in the current episode by unexpectedly weak productivity growth earlier in the expansion.
14,"Recent data are consistent with an increase in the productivity trend, but given that the evidence for an upturn in the productivity trend is so recent, considerable uncertainty remains about what the underlying trend will be going forward."
15,"Many forecasters, myself included, have been revising upward their estimate of trend productivity growth in response to recent unexpectedly strong productivity growth."
16,Part of the increase--about ¼ percentage point--from the earlier trend of just above 1 percent reflects improved measurement and is not in fact an acceleration of true productivity.
17,"Beyond that, an estimate of a 2 percent trend implies the trend rate of productivity growth has increased more than ½ percentage point."
18,This likely accounts for some portion of the recent improvement in labor productivity.
19,"The implications of such an acceleration in productivity are profound, at least if the increase is sustained going forward for a considerable period."
20,"Productivity is, of course, a close relative of real income per capita, a widely used measure of living standards."
21,Higher productivity growth therefore means a faster rate of improvement in living standards.
22,"Of course, at the Federal Reserve, the key question is, What does higher productivity growth mean for monetary policy?"
23,"First, monetary policy never should target a specific rate of growth in output but rather should adjust to changes in resource utilization rates and inflation."
24,This is because growth itself does not cause inflation; it is excessive utilization rates that are a proximate source of inflation pressures.
25,We sometimes try to capture this by saying that monetary policy should foster the maximum sustainable growth that the economy is capable of achieving.
26,"More precisely, once at full employment, monetary policy should accommodate the maximum growth that does not push the economy beyond that point."
27,"A monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability has to be careful to avoid stifling unexpected increases in trend growth, specifically by confusing higher trend growth with above-trend growth."
28,"In addition, monetary policy cannot accept responsibility for raising trend growth."
29,The only contribution monetary policy can make in this regard is through promoting price stability and thereby reducing the allocative distortions and possible biases against saving and investment associated with inflation.
30,"Another reason for avoiding growth as a target for monetary policy is that the preferred growth rate, at any time, depends on prevailing utilization rates."
31,"If the economy is at full employment and at the preferred rate of inflation, trend growth will indeed be the preferred outcome."
32,"However, if the economy is initially at utilization rates high enough to result in rising inflation over time, the preferred growth outcome will be below trend, allowing some unwinding of the initial excess demand."
33,"Therefore, it is always more precise to characterize the monetary policy response in terms of adjustments to changes in prevailing and projected utilization rates rather than in terms of a response to prevailing and projected growth."
34,"Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to gauge the degree of excess demand associated with a given utilization rate, a subject I will return to later."
35,"What are the implications for monetary policy of a step-up in trend productivity growth and, hence, trend real GDP growth?"
36,"First, such a development would ultimately call for an upward revision to the targets for money growth, so that the money growth targets would remain consistent with an unchanged target for the inflation rate."
37,"As a practical matter, however, this is not a serious policy issue because the monetary aggregate targets play only a minor role in the conduct of monetary policy today."
38,"However, if the apparent higher trend productivity and GDP growth persists, at some point the money growth ranges should be appropriately adjusted."
39,"Under the prevailing operational regime of setting a target for the federal funds rate, money growth would automatically adjust to accommodate the higher rate of trend growth, at an unchanged nominal federal funds rate target."
40,"Over the longer run, the challenge under an interest-rate regime is to align the real federal funds rate with its new equilibrium value, which is likely to increase with a higher trend rate of productivity growth (due to a higher return on capital that underlies the new equilibrium real interest rate in the economy)."
41,"The principal challenge to a monetary policy focused on utilization rates is that an unexpected shift in productivity growth, in effect lowers the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation (the NAIRU) for awhile."
42,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating."
43,Assume that the increase in productivity is not anticipated and therefore does not immediately raise workers’ real wage demands.
44,"With unchanged nominal wage demands and higher productivity, firms will experience a decline in unit labor costs."
45,"But competition will quickly force the lower costs to be passed through to consumers in lower prices, lowering price inflation relative to nominal wage change."
46,"This decline in inflation, in turn, will put some downward pressure on nominal wage gains."
47,"The net result is that an unanticipated increase in the rate of growth of productivity is another example of a favorable supply shock, temporarily lowering inflation."
48,"It is useful, nevertheless, to distinguish price shocks--such as declines in energy or non-oil import prices--from productivity growth shocks that have their initial effects on costs rather than on prices."
49,"During a transitional period following an unexpected increase in the productivity trend, until productivity growth stabilizes and the higher rate becomes anticipated it will be possible to operate at resource utilization rates beyond what is sustainable over the longer run without inflationary consequences."
50,"It is perfectly reasonable to take advantage of this opportunity, as long as care is taken to return to more sustainable utilization rates as the disinflationary force of the upward shift in productivity growth dissipates."
51,"Of course, policymakers must also weigh the option of “opportunistic disinflation” in such a circumstance--the possibility of reducing inflation toward their long-run target without depressing, even temporarily, resource utilization rates."
52,"However, if inflation is already at its target, the option of permitting temporarily higher output and employment clearly dominates."
53,The apparent increase in the productivity trend probably has been an important disinflationary force over the last few years.
54,Some of the benefits in this case have been taken in the form of lower inflation and some in the form of temporarily higher resource utilization rates.
55,"An important issue therefore is whether current utilization rates are sustainable, once productivity growth stabilizes."
56,An overheated economy is one operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity and therefore experiencing excess demand in labor and product markets.
57,The importance of the concept follows from the reasonable expectation that excess demand in labor and product markets is a proximate source of higher inflation.
58,The first is to find some proxy for excess demand in labor and product markets.
59,We have to satisfy ourselves with proxies because excess demand is not directly measurable.
60,"The second is to look for the consequences of overheating, in the form of acceleration in wage gains or prices."
61,Proxies for excess demand are utilization rates in the labor and product markets--such as the unemployment rate in the labor market and capacity utilization in the product market.
62,"Capacity utilization is measured only in the “industrial” sector, so it is a narrow measure of generalized excess demand in the product market."
63,"Nevertheless, it remains an important proxy for the balance of supply and demand in the product market."
64,"At any given time, a lower unemployment rate or higher capacity utilization rate implies greater demand relative to supply in the respective market."
65,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply."
66,"That’s the difficult part, because we observe only absolute unemployment and capacity utilization rates and have to estimate their respective “natural” rates, the levels consistent with balance between supply and demand in the respective markets."
67,"The less stable they are, the more uncertainty we will have at any point about the underlying degree of excess demand."
68,We have no choice but to estimate the natural rates from equations that try to capture inflation dynamics.
69,"That’s all the Phillips Curve is--an equation that relates nominal wage change to expected inflation and excess demand in the labor market, proxied by the unemployment rate relative to an implicit estimate of the NAIRU, derived directly from the estimation of the equation."
70,"Second, the signals about excess demand coming from labor and product markets--that is from unemployment and capacity utilization rates--have diverged to an unusual degree, making an assessment of the overall degree of excess demand in the economy still more difficult."
71,"Third, the economy has been subject to powerful price shocks in this episode--including significant swings in oil prices and exchange rates."
72,"Such shocks are a second proximate source of movements in inflation, and their presence further complicates the identification of the signal from excess demand as well as the assessment of what utilization rates will trigger rising inflation in the near term."
73,"Fourth, it appears that there has been an upturn in the productivity trend, which, as noted above, acts as a disinflationary force for a period of time, further masking underlying excess demand and further complicating the assessment of sustainable utilization rates."
74,"So, where does all this put us in terms of proxies for excess demand?"
75,"We’re in an environment where reasonable people can disagree about whether or not there is currently excess demand in the economy and, given that uncertainty, whether or not we ought to use evidence based on estimates of excess demand directly in the conduct of monetary policy."
76,It also puts a priority on developing a strategy that takes account of possible shifts in and uncertainty about both productivity growth and the NAIRU.
77,"Although it appears that there is excess demand in the labor market, its effect has been diminished by the combination of the absence of corresponding excess demand in the product markets, the residue of the long period of reinforcing favorable price shocks, and the force of the unexpected acceleration in trend productivity."
78,"As the favorable price shocks dissipate or reverse and once trend productivity growth stabilizes, there is a risk that excess demand in the labor market will put the economy on a path of rising inflation, unless growth slows enough to unwind the excess demand before inflation begins to move upward."
79,"Given the momentum in sales and expectations for a stronger pace of inventory building in the second half, the consensus is that growth will rebound in the second half to trend or above, though we have not yet seen the effects on spending of the rise in bond rates and the flattening of equity prices since the spring."
80,This should help to slow the growth of domestic demand.
81,"Although there is some risk that growth could remain above trend and therefore aggravate any initial excess demand, a major concern remains that the prevailing balance of supply and demand in the labor market might put upward pressure on inflation, even if growth slows to trend ahead."
82,Let me briefly comment on the second indicator of excess demand.
83,"Instead of trying to measure the state of balance or imbalance between supply and demand, we could focus on observing the consequence of excess demand--specifically, increases in prices--or, for a given initial inflation rate, increases in inflation."
84,"I read the recent inflation data as at least suggesting that the underlying inflation rate is stabilizing, after a period of decline, without any evidence of a broad-based upturn in inflation."
85,"Nominal wage increases have moderated since the middle of 1998, likely reflecting the decline in inflation associated with a combination of favorable supply shocks, including the unexpected increase in the productivity trend."
86,"Some of the most recent data suggest that the growth of nominal compensation is no longer declining, and there are hints in the data and in anecdotes that wage pressures may be building."
87,How should monetary policy respond to increasing utilization rates?
88,"Should real interest rates be held constant until utilization rates increase above some threshold, for example, or should real interest rates be more smoothly pro-cyclical, gradually increasing in response to rising utilization rates?"
89,That is simply a question of what systematic policy response works best to promote the dual objectives of monetary policy: promoting price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment.
90,"My judgment is that a regime in which there is a gradual, systematic pro-cyclical response of real interest rates is the one that produces the best trade-off between inflation and output variability."
91,I will return to this problem when I take up the question of how preemptive monetary policy can and should be.
92,"Equity prices have increased enormously over the past four years, to levels that challenge previous valuation standards."
93,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.
94,"Most important, policymakers should reflect the higher value of equities in their forecasts for aggregate spending and adjust monetary policy as necessary to remain consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy."
95,"The key here is to remain focused on broad macroeconomic performance, responding indirectly to the movements in equity prices--whether the higher value of equities appears driven by fundamentals or otherwise--rather than to use policy directly to influence the value of equities."
96,"Specifically, it could discourage them from tightening in response to robust demand driven in part by past increases in market values, counting instead on an autonomous correction in equity values, the degree and timing of which has to be extremely uncertain."
97,"On the other hand, given such suspicions, policymakers should be alert to the potential that a tightening of policy could have a disproportionate effect on demand, if it induces a reassessment of market fundamentals."
98,"This does not mean, however, that policymakers are trapped and cannot respond to robust demand and rising inflation risks."
99,"While the stock market should not be a target for monetary policy, policymakers should pay attention to the signals from the market."
100,An aggressive rise in equity prices can be a sign of highly favorable financial conditions in general and a highly accommodative monetary policy in particular.
101,"If this occurs when the economy is already near potential, policymakers should re-evaluate the appropriateness of their policy setting in terms of promoting price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment."
102,"It is important to note that policymakers should not target the level of equity prices on the way down any more than on the way up but, in both directions, should take the movement in equity prices into account in their forecast and hence in the setting of monetary policy."
103,Monetary Policy Q&A 1.
104,Does prevailing uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the recent forecast errors diminish the ability of monetary policy to be preemptive?
105,But that does not mean that there cannot be a preemptive element in monetary policy.
106,The critical questions are just how preemptive can and should monetary policy be today?
107,"Second, with respect to inflation, policy can still be preemptive if it responds to incoming data on utilization rates, given the link between current utilization rates and future inflation."
108,"Of course, the degree of confidence that policymakers have in this link (and specifically in their measure of excess demand) will determine how preemptive they are prepared to be."
109,"The greater uncertainty about the level of excess demand should, I believe, diminish the aggressiveness with which monetary policy responds to changes in utilization rates."
110,"To sever this relationship of monetary policy either to incoming data on utilization rates or to the forecast altogether, however, would remove the key elements of preemptive monetary policy with respect to containing inflation and leave policy entirely reactive."
111,"There are, however, a couple of constructive policy responses in light of prevailing uncertainties about the level of excess demand and the forecast."
112,"First, policymakers could update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap (assuming, in the first place, that they find these concepts useful, as I do) in light of realizations of unemployment, output, inflation, and other variables."
113,"In following this approach, policymakers would become less responsive to declines in the unemployment rate, to the extent that estimates of the NAIRU are revised downward as unemployment and inflation decline together."
114,"Second, policymakers could attenuate the response of the real federal funds rate to declines in the unemployment rate in a region around their estimate of the NAIRU."
115,"But once the unemployment rate gets far enough below (or above) the estimated NAIRU so that confidence returns that the labor market is experiencing excess demand (or supply), then the more normal response of real interest rates to incremental declines in the unemployment rate would again become appropriate."
116,"If you take care to adjust your estimate of the NAIRU and the output gap in response to incoming data, you would be unwise to ignore these revised measures of the unemployment and output gaps in setting policy."
117,I believe that there are two interrelated dimensions of the so-called tilt or bias in monetary policy.
118,The tilt provides the market with an indication of the Committee’s balancing of the risks related to emerging excess demand or supply and inflation going forward and hence in what direction policy is more likely to move.
119,This decision should be understood as an effort to increase the transparency of monetary policy and to allow the Committee to communicate more clearly its views of the balance of risks and the prospects of further policy actions going forward.
120,It has also become clear that it is not easy to communicate some of the subtleties and complexities of monetary policy intentions in a single word.
121,Does the response of the bond market to evolving economic developments reduce or eliminate the importance of activist monetary policy?
122,"A theme we sometimes hear is that the FOMC can take a permanent vacation, leaving the conduct of monetary policy to the bond market."
123,"What this means is that when bond rates rise in the expectation of future monetary policy tightening (that is, in the expectation of higher short-term rates), we have a choice."
124,"There is, however, also the possibility that the failure to tighten when such a move is widely expected may leave in place higher long-term rates (or raise them further), if our failure to act is viewed as inconsistent with our commitment to price stability."
125,"On the other hand, when the bond market is viewed as having inappropriately built in expectations of higher rates, monetary policy ought to provide an anchor, in the form of an unchanged funds rate, to which the bond market can return as incorrect expectations are unwound."
126,But preemptive pricing in the bond market can make monetary policy more effective by speeding the response of long-term rates to changing economic conditions.
127,There is a potential synergy here between monetary policy and the bond market.
128,"The more transparent is monetary policy, the more effective will be preemptive pricing in the bond market."
129,"The more effective is preemptive pricing in the bond market, the shorter the lag from a change in monetary policy to the effect on aggregate demand, and hence the more effective is monetary policy."
130,"First, clarify the logic of the recent Fed tightenings and then provide some insight into the prospects for near-term monetary policy in light of the comments above on the outlook and the strategy of monetary policy."
131,"In my view, the current monetary policy problem has two dimensions."
132,"The first dimension is to adjust the federal funds rate so that it is appropriate in terms of prevailing utilization and inflation rates, with appropriate regard to the uncertainty about the measurement of utilization rates."
133,The easings last fall were implemented at a time of sharp dislocations in financial markets and sharp downward revisions to the forecasts of both global and U.S. growth this year.
134,"In determining how much of the easings to reverse, one also has to take into account the decline in core inflation since last fall, as well as uncertainties about translating the current utilization rates into measures of excess demand."
