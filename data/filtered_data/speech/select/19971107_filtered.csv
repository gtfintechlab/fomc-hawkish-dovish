0,"As we move closer to price stability, the necessity of measuring prices accurately has become an especial challenge."
1,Biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter when inflation is high.
2,"They do matter when, as now, a debate has emerged over whether our economies are moving toward price deflation."
3,"In today's advanced economies, allocative decisions are primarily made not by governments but by markets, and the central guide to the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy is prices."
4,"Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions of consumers and producers, directing resources toward their highest valued use."
5,"Of course, this signaling process would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure individual and aggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy."
6,"Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices."
7,"Nonetheless, in a modern monetary economy, accurate price measurement is of considerable importance, increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financial stability."
8,"Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments, not only involving inflation but also involving real output and productivity."
9,"If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in real output and productivity."
10,"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences."
11,"Clearly, central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth."
12,"Moreover, many economic transactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index, most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may nevertheless take such an index into account less formally."
13,"If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economic transactions will be skewed."
14,"The measured price indexes have played an especially prominent role in Germany, both in terms of public perceptions of inflation performance and as a guide for policymakers."
15,The Bundesbank's long-standing commitment to price stability and the public's support for that commitment derive at least to some extent from Germany's experiences with hyperinflation earlier this century.
16,"Given this experience with the devastation that such inflation can bring to the economy and to people's lives, it comes as no surprise that your public and your policymakers give such careful scrutiny to the available measures of inflation."
17,Germany has a reputation for special vigilance in guarding the stability of the price level and has achieved an admirable record of success in maintaining low inflation over the postwar period.
18,"From the standpoint of monetary policy, this very success makes accurate price measurement all the more important."
19,"When measured inflation is high, we can be confident that the proper direction of monetary policy is to bring inflation lower."
20,"But when measured inflation is low, the proper direction of monetary policy, as I indicated, could depend crucially on the accuracy of those measurements."
21,"The importance of accurate price measurement was particularly apparent during unification, when it became necessary to gauge productivity in East and West Germany on a comparable basis."
22,"Initial estimates of East German productivity relative to that of the West were considerably higher than later, more accurate estimates showed to be the case."
23,"These differences, we are told, owed largely to the difficulties in adjusting the prices of East German products to take into account that they were, on average, of lower quality than the equivalent items produced in the West."
24,"In thinking about the problems of price measurement, a distinction must be made between the measurement of individual prices, on the one hand, and the aggregation of those prices into indexes of the overall price level, on the other."
25,"The notion of what we mean by a general price level--or more relevantly, its change--is never unambiguously defined."
26,"Moreover, in practice, aggregation can be complicated because standard price indexes frequently assume that individuals and businesses purchase the same basket of goods and services over time--whereas, in fact, people substitute some goods for others when relative prices change and as new goods are introduced."
27,"How one aggregates individual prices, of course, depends on the purpose of the measure."
28,"It is the measurement of individual prices, not the aggregation of those prices, that is so difficult conceptually."
29,"At first glance, observing and measuring prices might not appear especially daunting."
30,"After all, prices are at the center of virtually all economic transactions."
31,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant over time.
32,Defining such a constant-quality unit of output is the central conceptual difficulty in price measurement.
33,"Such a definition may be clear for unalloyed aluminium ingot of 99.7 percent purity for the vast proportion of transactions; consequently, its price can be compared over time with a degree of precision adequate for virtually all producers and consumers of aluminium ingot."
34,"Similarly, the prices of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or of a linear meter of cotton broad woven fabric, can be reasonably compared over a period of years."
35,"But when the characteristics of products and services are changing rapidly, defining the unit of output, and thereby adjusting an item's price for improvements in quality, can be exceptionally difficult."
36,"These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as service prices, which are generally more difficult to measure, become more prominent in aggregate price measures."
37,The continual introduction of new goods and services onto the markets creates special challenges for price measurement.
38,"The area of medical care, where technology is changing in ways that make techniques of only a decade ago seem archaic, provides some particularly striking illustrations of the difficulties involved in measuring quality-adjusted prices."
39,"How, then, will we measure inflation in the future if our measurement techniques become increasingly obsolete?"
40,"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle."
41,"Embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to those who buy and sell the product if not to the outside observer."
42,"Furthermore, so long as people continue to exchange nominal interest rate debt instruments and contract for future payments in terms of dollars or other currencies, there must be a presumption about the future purchasing power of money no matter how complex individual products become."
43,"Market participants do have a sense of the aggregate price level and how they expect it to change over time, and these views must be embedded in the value of financial assets."
44,"The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds, while providing us with useful information, does not solve the problem of ascertaining an economically meaningful measure of the general price level."
45,"By necessity, the total return on indexed bonds must be tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money."
46,"To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction."
47,"Moreover, we are, as yet, unable to separate compensation for inflation risk from compensation for expected inflation."
48,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision."
49,"In those circumstances, then--at least for purposes of monetary policy--these measures could obviate the more traditional approaches to aggregate price measurement now employed."
50,"They may help us understand, for example, whether markets perceive the true change in aggregate prices to reflect fixed or variable weight indexes of the components or whether arithmetic or logarithmic weighting of the components is more appropriate."
51,"But, for the foreseeable future, we shall have to rely on our statistical agencies to produce the price data necessary to assess economic performance and to make economic policy."
52,This technique associates changes in a product's price with changes in product characteristics.
53,"In the United States, prior to the mid-1980s, computer prices simply were held constant in the national accounts."
54,"Now, with the introduction of hedonic techniques, the accounts show computer prices declining at double-digit rates, surely a more accurate estimate of the true quality-adjusted price change."
55,The few other countries that have introduced these techniques--France being the most recent--show computer prices declining much more rapidly than in the majority of countries that have not yet done so.
56,The issues surrounding the appropriate measurement of computer prices also illustrate some of the difficulties of valuing goods and services when there are significant interactions among users of the products.
57,"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes."
58,"Despite the advances in price measurement that have been made over the years, there remains considerable room for improvement."
59,"In the United States, a group of experts empaneled by the Senate Finance Committee--the Boskin commission--concluded that the consumer price index has overstated changes in the cost of living by roughly one percentage point per annum in recent years."
60,"About half of this bias owed to inadequate adjustment for quality improvement and the introduction of new goods, and about half reflected the manner in which the individual prices were aggregated."
61,"Recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added corroborating evidence of price mismeasurement, using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of the microstatistical exercises."
62,"Specifically, employing disaggregated data from the national income and product accounts, this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in the service sector is implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained."
63,Much more reasonable is the view that prices have been mismeasured and that the true quality-adjusted prices have been rising more slowly than the published price indexes.
64,"Properly measured, output and productivity trends in these service industries might be considerably stronger than suggested by the published data."
65,"Assuming, for example, no change in productivity for these industries would imply a price bias consistent with the Boskin commission findings."
66,"Of course, the United States is not the only country that faces challenges in constructing an accurate measure of inflation."
67,"In a recent survey of consumer price indexes in its member countries, the OECD found that most countries felt that measurement bias was smaller in magnitude in their own countries than in the United States."
68,"Many countries' responses were prepared by the countries' statistical agencies, which tend to take a somewhat more sanguine view of the adequacy of the existing price statistics than do outside economists."
69,"Indeed, as I noted previously, most European countries still have yet to adopt the most up-to-date techniques for measuring computer prices in their national accounts."
70,"Indeed, issues of price measurement may be especially important for the European countries entering into monetary union."
71,"For a region with a single monetary policy, a single, consistently estimated measure of inflation is necessary to gauge the region's economic performance."
72,"Toward that end, as you know, Eurostat publishes harmonized indexes of consumer prices that are constructed using a common basket of goods and services for each EU member state and using similar statistical methodology."
73,"Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area."
74,"In the United States, for example, the CPI calculated on this harmonized basis would have increased three or four tenths of a percentage point more slowly than the published CPI, on average, over the past few years, largely because prices of owner-occupied housing have been rising more rapidly than the other components."
75,"Arguably, the published index, with broader coverage, is more relevant to assessing inflation trends in the United States than would be the harmonized index."
76,"As long as relative prices can and do diverge across countries, the harmonized indexes need to contain as broad a range of items as is practical."
77,"As monetary union proceeds, then, it would be to the advantage of monetary authorities in the Euro area to have a consistent measure of inflation defined over a broad basket of goods and services that is measured according to established statistical methods."
78,"Indeed, measuring prices consistently across countries could be an important step toward making price measurement more accurate everywhere, if harmonization results in each country's best practices being adopted throughout the monetary union."
79,"Moreover, different prices of the same tradable good across the community might signal inefficiencies of distribution which were not evident from other sources."
80,Harmonization of CPIs in Europe is just one of many examples demonstrating why price measurement techniques cannot be static.
81,"The information revolution, which lies behind so much of the rapid technological change that makes prices difficult to measure, may also play an important role in helping our statistical agencies acquire the necessary speed and agility to better capture the changes taking place in our economies."
82,But the possibilities offered by information technology for the improvement of price measurement may turn out to be much broader in scope.
