0,"The financial press is full of reports on talks by member X reporting that growth is a bit strong (weak), the economy is working its way over a hill (through a valley), inflation (deflation) is a clear (remote) threat."
1,"There seems to be an agreed code for translating these statements into the likelihood that member X will vote to raise (lower) interest rates at the next meeting, and the federal funds futures market responds accordingly."
2,Most economists feel that fiscal policy should be anchored in the long run by the need to preserve overall national saving rates and prevent explosive growth in government debt.
3,"In my view, monetary policy should be similarly structured."
4,The long-run anchor is clearly price stability.
5,"Following Milton Friedman, inflation in the long run is a monetary phenomenon, as is deflation."
6,"Hence, the long-term goal of the Fed is to keep prices stable by some definition, avoiding either inflation or deflation."
7,But the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate--to achieve not only price stability but also the maximum sustainable rate of employment.
8,"If prices are stable in the long term, employment should grow along something like a full-employment path."
9,"And, as with fiscal policy, if the long-term anchor is holding, the Fed should have the added ability to respond to short-term fluctuations in employment by raising or lowering interest rates without exciting market fears about inflation or deflation."
10,"To earn this credibility the Fed should behave in a systematic way--generally lowering interest rates when employment rates are, or would otherwise be forecast to be, below the long-term sustainable rate; and raising interest rates when employment rates are, or would otherwise be forecast to be, above the long-term sustainable rate."
11,"The most common is flexible inflation targeting (FIT), a monetary regime now used successfully by about twenty countries around the world."
12,"Under FIT, the central bank or the government announces an inflation target and tries to hit it, not in the present quarter but over a one- or two-year period."
13,"The most successful FIT regimes are also symmetric, permitting or requiring expansionary responses to an inflation rate that is below the target."
14,"Under the Taylor rule, the central bank would try to establish a normal level of short-term interest rates but would raise rates as inflation threatens and lower them as unemployment threatens."
15,"In a wide variety of circumstances, a sensible monetary response to a demand shock would look much the same for an FIT central bank as for a central bank following the Taylor rule."
16,One distinction is that the Taylor rule does not require the central bank to announce a formal inflation target.
17,But even this distinction may be more apparent than real if the central bank following a Taylor rule actually follows a reasonably steady inflation policy.
18,"The Fed, for example, does not follow FIT and has never announced a formal inflation target."
19,"But it has told the world many times that of all the available measures, it regards the price index for core personal consumption expenditures as the most realistic indicator of actual inflation."
20,"The time series for this preferred indicator shows that, over the past seven years, inflation has averaged 1.7 percent per year, not much above what many consider to be an inevitable quality-change bias in the index, implying a true inflation rate of close to zero."
21,"Pretty stable prices, and a pretty reasonable indication of an inflation target for a central bank that has never announced one."
22,"As is well known, monetary policy works with long lags: a policy change influences aggregate demand in a distributed lag pattern beginning soon after the change and extending as long as eighteen months or two years."
23,"This lag pattern places a premium on monetary policy being ahead of the curve, in current jargon."
24,"Taken literally, a simple Taylor rule, with the central bank responding to current values of inflation and unemployment rates, is not."
25,"However the policy strategy is articulated, anchoring it on some concept of long-term price stability is important, as is permitting short-term flexibility to deal with shocks; essentially the same goals most economists have in mind for fiscal policy."
26,"Money versus Interest Rates For most of the post-World War II period, monetary economists have vigorously debated whether the Fed should target money or interest rates in setting policy."
27,"As William Poole has shown, if spending shocks predominate, it makes sense to target money, or monetary quantities; if money demand shocks predominate, it makes sense to target interest rates."
28,"In the short run, money demand shocks do seem to predominate, and most central banks in the world now operate in terms of some short-term interest rate."
29,"Should they change interest rates rarely, as the European Central Bank appears to believe?"
30,Interest rate targeting can be thought of as monetary targeting with sterilization of shocks in the money demand function.
31,"Under pure monetary targeting, interest rates would fluctuate with shocks in spending."
32,"Under sterilized monetary targeting, interest rates would still fluctuate with shocks in spending."
33,"In a period of many such shocks, interest rates should fluctuate, and a central bank that targets rates should permit them to fluctuate."
34,"Thus, I have always felt it inconsistent to argue, as some do, that central banks should look partly to monetary targeting and be reluctant to change interest rates."
35,"There may, of course, be some value in the smoothing of interest rate movements."
36,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions."
37,"In normal, middle-ground ranges, most central banks seem to feel that interest rate targeting works fine."
38,"When inflation was rampant in the United States in the early 1980s, for example, the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker for a time adopted money targeting to provide a clearer basis for policy."
39,"At the time, inflationary expectations were exploding and it became very difficult to know what nominal interest rates should be."
40,It was easier for the Volcker Fed to set the rate of monetary expansion at a sustainable long-term value consistent with stable prices and let nominal interest rates find their own level.
41,"When short-term interest rates hit zero, the central bank may have to go back to monetary targeting to distinguish more-expansionary from less-expansionary policies, all of which entail short-term nominal interest rates close to zero."
42,"In these circumstances, with prices actually falling, the central bank may have little choice but to expand liquidity quite rapidly in the hope that the liquidity will arrest deflation, even if nominal short rates remain stuck in the neighborhood of zero for a range of monetary growth rates."
43,Bubbles The issue du jour in monetary policymaking is asset price bubbles.
44,"Our mandate tells us to stabilize employment and the prices of goods and services, not asset prices."
45,"It may be that stabilizing asset prices is the way to stabilize goods prices and employment, but one can think of many situations in which that does not seem to be the case."
46,"In the late 1990s, for example, inflation was low and near a stable price target, and inflation showed few signs of accelerating."
47,"Productivity, on the other hand, was clearly accelerating and apparently supporting a boom in stock prices."
48,"We now know that faulty accounting practices may have aided those stock prices, but the full extent of these accounting problems was not clear then, even to those who looked mainly at the sanitized version of profits in the national income accounts."
49,"One can debate interminably the proper monetary response in such circumstances, but it certainly seemed sensible at the time for the Fed to focus on its primary indicators, inflation and unemployment, and not to try to target asset prices."
50,"Generalizing from this example, my own view of the matter is that whether we follow FIT or some version of the Taylor rule, we ought to have a forward-looking focus on inflation and unemployment."
51,We ought to be anchoring policy to the goal of long-run price stability and responding to output shocks or other variables in a way consistent with this long-term price stability.
52,"There may be times when asset prices become one of these other variables, or when rapid changes in asset prices may threaten the long-term stability of either of our primary goals."
53,"In such cases we should not try to target asset prices, but we should take asset prices into account in our formulation of policy."
54,"Exchange Rates One doesn't hear so much about it now, but in former days there was also a huge debate about exchange rate policy."
55,"Should monetary policy be guided by the need to maintain currency parities or by the domestic needs of the economy, with currency rates left free to find their own levels?"
56,"In other words, fixed or floating exchange rates?"
57,Monetary policy needs an anchor.
58,"When fixed exchange rates covered the whole world, that anchor was maintaining currency parities, or keeping all exchange rates stable."
59,"Now that exchange rates are free to find their own level, for floating rate countries and outside the currency union, that anchor is gone."
60,That is why it is all the more important for floating rate economies and unions to anchor monetary policy in terms of long-term price stability.
61,The asset price question and the exchange rate question are connected in an interesting way.
62,"In each case, many observers seem to want an exception--yes, monetary policy should target inflation, but it should also worry about asset prices (or exchange rates)."
63,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment but not to target asset prices (or exchange rates)."
64,"Though a consensus on exchange rate regimes may be emerging, the related issue of how exchange rates respond to monetary changes seems anything but settled."
65,"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports."
66,"If the central bank is implementing policy by setting interest rates, what are these target interest rates?"
67,"After all, monetary policy is important and people should know how it is being set."
68,"These are a few of the main issues, and my thoughts, on present-day monetary policy issues."
