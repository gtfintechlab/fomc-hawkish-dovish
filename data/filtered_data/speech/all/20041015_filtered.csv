0,"Even so, from time to time monetary policy settings have been influenced by the perception of a potential for serious economic and financial dislocation."
1,"Before going further, I should say the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors or its staff.1 Adjusting monetary policy in such circumstances is an example of a more general phenomenon."
2,"When central banks are not tightly focused on achieving a specific objective for an exchange rate, a monetary aggregate, or an inflation rate, policymakers may be granted a degree of discretion and can take account of the entire distribution of potential economic outcomes and their effects on societal welfare."
3,"More countries have recognized the benefits of allowing exchange rates to fluctuate freely, and the inflation-targeting regimes that have replaced exchange rate anchors in many countries have become more flexible over time."
4,"This evolution has not only allowed policymakers greater scope to weigh more than one short-run objective in the pursuit of long-term price stability, but it has also permitted them to pay greater attention to the consequences of potential economic outcomes with relatively low probabilities."
5,"In Chairman Greenspan’s risk-management paradigm, low-probability, high-impact events are always factors in the calculus of monetary policy.2 This approach recognizes that “impact” is the product of two separate distributions--one for expected economic outcomes and one for the effect of those outcomes on welfare--that may be nonlinear."
6,"Inflation has been low and stable in most economies, expectations that inflation will remain contained are much better anchored, and output fluctuations have been damped."
7,"This favorable economic climate has reduced the risk that temporarily aiming somewhat away from hitting objectives dead on will engender behaviors, like rising inflation expectations, that could have seriously adverse and destabilizing consequences for the economy."
8,"Although a whole range of possible events with varying probabilities and effects can be taken into account by monetary policymakers, the influence of possible low-probability events is most evident when serious instability is a much greater threat than usual."
9,"Guarding against such a low-probability, high-impact event can in turn significantly skew policy temporarily away from the rate setting most likely to achieve longer-run objectives for inflation or output.3 I will illustrate the rationale for making such choices and their possible implications by relating some of the episodes in which the Federal Reserve has given unusual weight to possible tail events--in reaction to the financial market events of 1987 and 1998 and in response to the threat of deflation in 2001 through 2003."
10,"In both instances, developments in financial markets caused forecasts of economic activity and inflation to be marked down."
11,"But concerns went beyond the direct macroeconomic fallout from the initial movement in asset prices, and in both cases the Federal Reserve, therefore, eased more than probably would have been justified by the change in the center of gravity of the forecast itself."
12,"Importantly, the potential effects of these events on confidence--on the psychology of market participants and of savers and spenders more generally--raised the specter of continuing flights to liquidity and safety that could disrupt the financial markets and economic activity even more severely."
13,"In addition, lower interest rates--taking some chances temporarily on the side of stronger activity--should help to limit upward pressures on private interest rates and restore market liquidity."
14,"In these circumstances, the zero bound on nominal interest rates could potentially constrain conventional policy easing, further adding to the potential for nonlinear responses in the economy."
15,"Policy rates were already quite low, the economy had been weak for some time, and inflation had settled into the zone of price stability."
16,"Although other types of monetary policy actions likely would be effective at the zero bound, they had not been tried."
17,And in the last year or so economic growth has strengthened and the possibility of destabilizing deflation receded.
18,"Omitted from my list of examples of low-probability, high-impact events that the Federal Reserve has addressed with monetary policy are episodes in which a possible substantial deviation of key asset prices from fundamentals threatens future disruption when those prices correct."
19,Our monetary policy certainly takes into account the effects of asset prices on the likely course of the economy and prices.
20,But we have not attempted to damp fluctuations in asset prices by tightening or easing policy more than the medium-term macroeconomic outlook implies.
21,"In concept, a significant deviation of important asset prices from fundamental values raises the risk of a future reversal that would add to economic volatility, representing a low-probability event that, like many others, could be given some weight in the stance of policy."
22,"Among other things, we are uncertain (a) about any judgment that the level of a particular class of asset prices is moving far enough away from fundamentals to make a correction inevitable and disruptive; (b) about the timing of a reversal of those prices, so that a step to truncate a movement, say by raising rates in response to a perception that the prices of some assets were becoming unsustainably high, does not increase economic instability by hitting the economy and asset prices just as the reversal occurs; and (c) about the response of asset prices, possibly driven by self-fulfilling optimism for a time, to a change in rates."
23,"As a result of this last unknown, one has difficulty assessing whether a change in policy large enough to prevent asset-price disequilibrium would have a greater adverse effect over time on economic performance than would allowing asset prices to evolve."
24,"Moreover, we have also recognized that much of the extra damage that rapidly changing asset prices may inflict occurs through weakening the financial system enough to cause a constriction in credit flows that restrains spending."
25,"From the vantage point of, say, 1999, when price-earnings ratios were at lofty levels and forecasts of annual-earnings growth over the longer term were in the high teens, an asset-price correction did not seem like a low-probability event."
26,"Although such a correction would result in considerable losses for those holding the assets when their prices fell and would damp demand for a time, its macroeconomic effect did not seem likely to be unusually large."
27,Thus the risks seem higher than with many other possible low-probability events that the balance of costs and benefits will turn out to be adverse when monetary policy is aimed away from fundamental objectives to influence asset prices.
28,"Given these uncertainties, we have chosen to react to the asset-price correction when it occurs rather than to try to head it off."
29,Monetary policymakers giving significant weight to low-probability events face several challenges.
30,One serious potential pitfall is paying so much attention to the tails of the distributions of possible outcomes that the central tendencies veer well away from objectives for economic and price stability--in effect paying too much for insurance.
31,"Moreover, when the threat of the low-probability event recedes into the past, policy may need to compensate over time in the other direction to preserve economic and price stability--to achieve the appropriate policy stance on average--a consideration that further complicates the policy decision in these circumstances."
32,"However, to the extent that the conduct of policy actually reduces the potential for high-impact events or more generally damps fluctuations in output and prices, risks are genuinely lower, and that situation should be reflected in the behavior of private agents."
33,"Damped fluctuations in economic activity and the containment of financial crises has made the populace, at large, better off."
34,"To be sure, adverse consequences for resource allocation, and perhaps even for the stability of output and prices, will occur if private agents overestimate the ability or willingness of central banks to damp volatility in asset prices or the economy."
35,"In the context of the sorts of decisions we are discussing on this panel, the question is whether the tendency of a risk-managing central bank to lean particularly hard against the consequences of asset-price declines might not give market participants a false sense of security."
36,"However, experience should have taught market participants that risk management by central banks does not prevent sharp movements in asset prices."
37,"Policy actions in 1987, 1998, and 2001-03 cushioned the economy, but they did not stop major declines in the prices of risky credits in 1998 or equities in 1987 or 2001."
38,"Any asymmetries in central bank reactions were aimed at stabilizing the economy, not achieving particular asset-price configurations."
39,The small effects of monetary policy asymmetries on the asset prices have been overwhelmed by the fundamentals of shifting perceptions of risk and future earnings.
40,"In gauging the effects of policy on asset prices, market participants should not be making systematic errors that distort resource allocation."
41,"In my view, these potential difficulties should not deter central banks from taking account of low-probability, high-impact events in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
