2,"The outlook is bright, but uncertainty remains, and employment and inflation are far from our goals."
3,"The latest jobs report is a reminder that the path of reopening and recoveryâ€”like the shutdownâ€”is likely to be uneven and difficult to predict, so basing monetary policy on outcomes rather than the outlook will serve us well."
4,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped 10.7 percent, supporting a robust 6.4 percent growth rate in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, despite a large runoff of inventories amid supply chain bottlenecks."
5,"For instance, the strength of domestic demand this year relative to next will depend on how quickly or slowly a large share of accumulated household savings is spent out."
6,"This, in turn, hinges in part on the distribution of household savings and how much is concentrated among households who are less likely to spend, perhaps because their services consumption returns only to pre-COVID levels or their near-term demand for durable goods has largely been satiated.4 There is also uncertainty about how much of the strong domestic aggregate demand will leak abroad rather than translating into domestic output."
7,"As supply chain and shipping bottlenecks ease, international spillovers could lead to some slippage between the increase in domestic demand and domestic resource utilization."
8,"While the fiscal support provided to households is raising consumer spending and GDP this year, the absence of similar transfers will lower the growth rate of spending next year relative to this year."
9,The boost to spending from pent up demand this year as the economy reopens is also unlikely to be repeated next year.
10,"Over the past few months, the demand for workers has strengthened as COVID-affected sectors have reopened."
11,"Although the fraction of the population ages 25 to 54 that is employed has improved in each month of this year, the current prime-age employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio of 76.9 percent is still far from the 80 percent level reached during both of the past two expansions.5 On the demand side, we saw a welcome increase of 331,000 jobs in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sector in April following a 206,000 increase in March."
12,The increase in average hours worked and the reduction in people who are working part time but would prefer full-time work suggest some employers are responding to the increase in demand by lengthening workweeks.
13,"There is good reason to expect a strong rebound in employment over coming quarters, although the different forces affecting demand and supply may lead to uneven rates of progress."
14,"But today, by any measure, employment remains far from our goals."
15,The unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.9 percent when we adjust the narrow 6.1 percent U-3 measure of unemployment to also reflect workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started and those who are misclassified.
16,"As of the latest reading, there is an employment shortfall of 8.2 million relative to the pre-pandemic level, and the employment shortfall is over 10 million if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the period since February 2020 in normal circumstances.11 The path of inflation is also difficult to predict, although there are a variety of reasons to expect an increase in inflation associated with reopening that is largely transitory."
17,"Most immediately, base effects are likely to contribute substantially to the 12-month readings of headline and core PCE inflation in April and May as the price declines of March and April 2020 roll out of the 12-month calculation."
18,"I also anticipate that the recent surge in energy prices, which contributed about 1/2 percentage point to the March 12-month headline PCE reading, will fade over time, although recent pipeline disruptions add some uncertainty."
19,It is much more difficult to predict the size and duration of supply-side bottlenecks and how these will interact with the pattern of demand to feed through into inflation.
20,"If past experience is any guide, production will rise to meet the level of goods demand before too long."
21,The supplyâ€“demand imbalances in the in-person services sector are expected to be resolved within a few quarters with progress on virus control and the return of in-person schooling.
22,"And demand growth itself is expected to moderate after a reopening surge, broadly coinciding with the time when some of the current tailwinds from fiscal support and makeup consumption turn to headwinds."
23,"Of course, there may be additional demand and supply surprises that could further complicate the inflation picture."
24,"To the extent that supply chain congestion and other reopening frictions are transitory, they are unlikely to generate persistently higher inflation on their own."
25,"A persistent material increase in inflation would require not just that wages or prices increase for a period after reopening, but also a broad expectation that they will continue to increase at a persistently higher pace."
26,A limited period of pandemic-related price increases is unlikely to durably change inflation dynamics.
27,"Past experience suggests many businesses are likely to compress margins and to rely on automation to reduce costs rather than fully passing on price increases.12 In the December Duke CFO Survey, roughly one-half of chief financial officers from large firms and about one-third of those from small firms reported ""using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on labor."
28,"Thus, there are compelling reasons to expect the well-entrenched inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter-century to reassert themselves next year as imbalances associated with reopening are resolved, work and consumption patterns settle into a post-pandemic ""new normal,"" and some of the current tailwinds shift to headwinds.14 I will be carefully monitoring measures of longer-term inflation expectations to ensure they are well anchored at 2 percent."
29,"To date, various measures suggest inflation expectations remain well anchored and broadly consistent with our new framework."
30,"The Index of Common Inflation Expectations moved back to 2 percent in the first quarter, returning to its level in 2018, which is lower than its level prior to 2014.15 In addition, the term structure of market-based measures of inflation compensation is consistent with market participants expecting a limited period of inflation above 2 percent."
31,A straight read of the difference between the forward nominal Treasury curve and the forward Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities curve implies inflation compensation is expected to be higher for the next two years and to decline subsequently and remain stable 5 and 10 years into the future.
32,I will remain attentive to the risk that what seem like transitory inflationary pressures could prove persistent as I closely monitor the incoming data.
33,"Should this risk manifest, we have the tools and the experience to gently guide inflation back to our target."
34,Achieving our inflation goal requires firmly anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
35,The latest employment report reminds us that realized outcomes can diverge from forward projections and underscores the value of patience.
36,"As the economy reopens fully and the recovery gathers momentum, it will be important to remain patiently focused on achieving the maximum-employment and inflation outcomes in our guidance."
