0,"In the spirit of old year endings and new year beginnings, I would like to review last year's economic performance, highlight some prospects for the upcoming year's economic performance, and, finally, raise some topics related to the underpinnings of macroeconomics and monetary policy."
1,"Last Year's Economic Performance The last twelve months have been a most challenging time in general, and particularly from the standpoint of monetary policy."
2,"Domestic demand was particularly strong, led by consumption expenditures, which grew at a 6 percent annual rate in both the first and second quarters of the year."
3,"During much of 1997, long-term interest rates had trended downward, and by early 1998 rates on fixed-rate mortgages were close to their lowest levels in twenty-five years."
4,"Similarly, the rise in equity prices over much of 1997 and the first half of 1998 provided ample incentive for consumption by raising the value of household assets and improving the general sense of financial well-being of our citizens, as well as lowering the cost of capital faced by businesses."
5,"During the first half of 1998, the net export drag, due in large part to the turmoil in Asia, subtracted about 2 percentage points from GDP growth."
6,"The trade deficit grew to well over $200 billion, again at an annual rate."
7,"For the March through July FOMC meetings last year, the Committee maintained a bias toward raising interest rates, but did not actually take action."
8,The sense of the FOMC was that the tightness in labor markets and general growth of demand would be likely to create upward pressures on wage growth and eventually on the rate of inflation.
9,"However, uncertainty regarding the degree and timing of impact from the Asian crises, and the fact that inflation was actually subdued, allowed us to adopt a ""wait and see"" posture."
10,"The second half of 1998 provided a very different configuration of events that, as you know, created the need for some monetary policy action."
11,"Interestingly, the catalyst for this monetary policy decision was not directly Asia or a slowing economy from net export drag."
12,"Rather, it was the indirect impact of Asia, working through a Russian debt moratorium and ruble devaluation, which provided the impetus for an easing in U.S. short-term interest rates."
13,"As we said in October in an inter-meeting rate reduction that brought the decline in the federal funds rate target to 50 basis points, ""Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future."""
14,"Outlook for 1999 At present the consensus view seems to be that growth in the second half of 1998 was probably a bit slower than the rapid pace of the first half, but that real GDP growth still averaged well above 3 percent on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis."
15,"The consensus is that this year's real growth will abate further, perhaps to about 2 percent, which would eventually produce a ""soft landing"" of sustained growth near the economy's potential and low inflation."
16,"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed."
17,"Observations and Open Issues From Recent Experiences Against this backdrop, I want to raise four issues important to the conduct of monetary policy for your consideration and study."
18,"The first two issues involve the supply side of the economy and grow out of the unusual conjuncture in recent years of rapid growth and high resource utilization with low, if not declining, inflation."
19,"The two standard measures of resource tightness, capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment, have historically moved fairly closely together over the cycle."
20,"We need a better understanding of the causes of this divergence, and, if it persists, a clearer sense of which measure of resource utilization best foreshadows the emergence of price pressures."
21,"Now, we hear, capacity in manufacturing is more technology intensive and can be adjusted more easily to reflect supply and demand conditions."
22,"Equity prices are set by the give and take of supply and demand, with participants buying and selling based on their own information."
23,"I believe that the Federal Reserve's tools, primarily short-term interest rates, are too blunt to attempt to achieve specific levels of stock market valuations."
24,"Therefore, equity prices have an impact on business fixed investment, a major driver of our economy."
25,We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that affect real economic activity.
26,"Economists propose numerous approaches to determining the ""correct"" level of equity prices."
27,"One such approach compares equity market valuations (namely earnings/price ratios) to the return on fixed income securities, generally the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond."
28,"Finally, I will turn to the role of international developments and exchange rates in policy."
29,"Our mandate gives priority to price stability and maximum sustainable employment, which I think are the right elements for us to consider in policy deliberations."
30,"However, we are not the world's central bank, and we cannot manage aggregate demand in all parts of the globe."
31,"However, exchange rates are clearly one transmission mechanism for monetary policy."
32,"Lower interest rates lead to a lower exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, making our products more competitive relative to those of other countries."
33,"This promotes exports, damps imports and leads to more rapid growth."
34,"In addition to those effects on real economic activity, exchange rates have an influence on inflation."
35,"As we saw last year, a strengthening U.S. dollar leads to lower domestic inflation by reducing the price of imports and restraining pricing power in import-competing industries."
36,"One might argue that a change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar should have a one-time effect on the price level, rather than a continuing impact on the inflation rate."
37,But price level changes do become imbedded in the inflation rate when they alter inflation expectations.
38,It seems likely to me that the persistent weakness in import prices of recent years has helped to damp inflation expectation and hence have had a persisting damping effect on the inflation rate.
39,"Recognizing the importance of exchange rate movements, there has also been much discussion and speculation of coordinated interest rate moves."
40,"Again, I believe that each central bank should focus on its own domestic economic setting, and structure monetary policy to maintain each economy at full, sustainable employment with stable prices."
41,"Finally, in the international sphere, I note that several countries have an explicit exchange rate mandate in monetary policy."
42,It is not clear whether these countries have a better or worse record with respect to inflation and growth than countries that do not put such a heavy weight on exchange rates in policy decisions.
43,"However, if other countries have achieved better results by focusing on indirect measures, such as exchange rates, we should be aware of that success."
44,"The economic outlook is for slowing, but still positive, growth, but in the context of contained inflation and tight labor markets."
