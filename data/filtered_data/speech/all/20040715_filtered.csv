0,"Now, as a member of the Federal Reserve Board and chair of the Board's Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs, I find myself looking at the growth and evolution of the financial system from a slightly different perspective than when I was a chief financial officer."
1,"First, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of the economic outlook and discuss in more detail how the evolution of household and business balance sheets in recent years is affecting economic activity."
2,"Although consumer spending has slowed this spring, housing demand has stayed very strong, and business outlays for capital equipment have continued to rebound from their weakness of the past several years."
3,"And with financial conditions still accommodative, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace in the second half of the year."
4,"At the same time, inflation has picked up more rapidly this year than I had expected."
5,"The price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy rose 1-1/2 percent over the twelve months ending in May, compared with 3/4 percent over the twelve months ending last December."
6,"The step-up in inflation in recent months reflects the ability of more companies to effectively raise prices, but it also has been exacerbated by transitory factors, such as the pass-through of large increases in energy prices and by large apparently one-time adjustments in such items as lodging away from home."
7,"The Federal Reserve will need to be alert to signs of higher inflation, and be ready to respond in order to fulfill its commitment to maintain price stability as a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth."
8,Some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years.
9,"But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the rapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices."
10,"Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years."
11,"Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these ""refis,"" often to pay down loans having higher interest rates."
12,"On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt."
13,"These households are more likely to default on their obligations than the typical borrower, but the increased risk is priced into loan terms."
14,"Although the bankruptcy rate remains elevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic growth in the United States since mid-2003."
15,"First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates."
16,"Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could be a good deal slower."
17,"Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have held their ground this year, reversing a good portion of the losses sustained over the previous three years."
18,"In addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 through 2003."
19,"Our most recent reading for the first quarter of this year indicates that home prices continued to rise, but at a more moderate pace."
20,"Four factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, significant cost-cutting and productivity gains, and a substantial narrowing in market- risk premiums."
21,"Even with interest rates expected to rise and profit growth expected to moderate, the financial condition of the business sector should remain strong and able to support continued expansion."
22,"First, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy."
23,"Many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, a move that has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations by more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000."
24,"As a result, the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in the past two-and-a-half years was limited to its slowest pace since the early 1990s."
25,"These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term."
26,"Moreover, research by Board staff suggests that firms that rely on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have tended to use derivatives in recent years to hedge their exposure to interest rate risk."
27,"Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and stretched out over time."
28,"Over the past few years, the drive to cut costs and boost efficiency has generated rapid productivity gains."
29,"Fuller utilization of the capabilities of capital already in place, ongoing improvements in inventory management, and streamlined production processes requiring fewer workers, to name but a few examples of efficiency enhancements, have boosted corporate profitability even when revenue growth was tepid."
30,"In the second half of last year, revenue growth picked up, and companies were able to leverage those productivity gains and produce a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability."
31,"Moreover, because cyclical factors likely contributed to the recent dramatic advances in productivity, we should expect productivity gains to moderate."
32,The recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter view.
33,The narrowing of spreads also reflects the outlook of investors for sustained strength in sales and profit growth.
34,"These four factors all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting sustained, solid growth of the U.S. economy."
35,"Of course, profit margins are likely to recede from their current high levels as labor and other costs pick up and productivity growth moderates."
36,"As a brief background, the special anti-tying statute that applies to banks generally prohibits a bank from conditioning the availability or price of one product on a requirement that the customer also obtain another product that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the bank."
37,The statute and the Board's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain one or more traditional bank products from the bank or an affiliate.
38,"Conclusion In conclusion, the economic expansion is now broad based, and the financial strength of businesses should help provide the foundation for continued growth in the months ahead."
