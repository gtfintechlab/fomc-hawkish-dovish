0,"Perhaps more than anything else, the crisis has raised an array of questions that demand our consideration, including the following: What are the major macroeconomic and financial characteristics that make countries vulnerable to crises?"
1,"Fueled by high domestic savings and investment rates, coupled with fiscal restraint and low inflation, real per capita GDP in these economies has risen dramatically since the 1960s."
2,"In contrast, during large portions of this period, the Latin American countries have been afflicted by a variety of economic ailments--including fiscal imbalances, capital flight, hyperinflation, and currency crashes--that have depressed domestic savings and investment and hindered economic growth."
3,"The Asian crisis began in Thailand during July 1997, when a run on the country's currency--the baht--forced the government to float the exchange rate."
4,"At that time, Brazil--the center of the crisis in Latin America--raised interest rates to high levels and drew down its stock of international reserves to keep its currency--the real--from falling."
5,"The high interest rates necessary to defend the real became increasingly difficult to sustain, and the authorities floated the currency in January 1999."
6,"Perhaps even more surprisingly, Brazilian inflation remained restrained after the devaluation, and the economy registered strong growth during the first half of 1999, nearly erasing the contraction that occurred during the second half of 1998."
7,Argentina successfully defended its exchange rate regime but has suffered a comparatively steep decline in economic activity.
8,"The high interest rates necessary to defend its peg to the dollar, along with the intensified uncertainty generated by the crisis and reduced competitiveness following the Brazilian devaluation, pushed Argentine GDP down 5 percent from mid-1998 to mid-1999."
9,"For a number of reasons, which I will discuss later, economic activity in Mexico generally has remained strong."
10,The country has endured only one quarter of negative GDP growth in the past three years.
11,"Significantly, Thailand's current account swung from a deficit of 8 percent of GDP in 1996 to a surplus of 12 percent of GDP in 1998."
12,"All three countries have remained in deficit, with total adjustment during the crisis estimated to amount to only about $15 billion (compared with $120 billion in Asia) and current account deficits remaining around 3 to 5 percent of GDP."
13,Asia's growth performance in the years immediately preceding the crisis did not hint of disruptive imbalances.
14,These economies were registering average annual growth of roughly 7 to 8 percent.
15,"By comparison, the Latin Americans recorded more moderate growth rates in the years before the crisis."
16,Inflation in both regions generally was well contained.
17,All of these countries ran current account deficits in the period before the crisis.
18,Were real exchange rates in Asia substantially overvalued relative to those in Latin America (exhibit 5)?
19,"During the first half of 1997, immediately before the onset of the crisis, the broad real exchange rates for Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia were only about 5 to 8 percent stronger than their 1990-96 average, and Korea's real exchange rate was slightly weaker than its 1990-96 average."
20,"The real exchange rate for the Philippines was more than 20 percent above its average, but--as previously noted above--this country was relatively less affected by the crisis."
21,"Hence, there is little evidence of substantial overvaluation of exchange rates in these countries."
22,"In comparison, during the first half of 1998, before the onset of the Latin American phase of the crisis, the real exchange rates for Argentina and Brazil were about 10 percent stronger than the 1990-97 average, while Mexico's real rate was about 5 percent stronger."
23,Countries in both regions ran small deficits or slight surpluses.
24,"Brazil was the pronounced exception, with a fiscal deficit well over 5 percent of GDP."
25,"In the mid-1990s, the country's domestic savings rate was about 35 percent of GDP, and the current account deficit was about 8 percent of GDP."
26,"These numbers far exceed the ratios of roughly 20 percent of GDP that prevailed in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, countries that also experienced considerably slower domestic loan growth in the years preceding the recent crisis."
27,"This gave policymakers in Latin America an opportunity to implement preemptive measures, such as interest rate increases and initiatives to improve fiscal performance, that may have helped minimize subsequent damage."
28,The response to the crisis in the two regions differed in at least one important respect: The Latin Americans were much quicker to raise interest rates aggressively.
29,"Notably, short-term interest rates in Thailand did not peak until the second half of 1997, well after the baht was allowed to float."
30,"The authorities were hesitant to raise interest rates rapidly during the first half of that year, notwithstanding the fact that the currency had come under severe pressure."
31,"As an alternative strategy, the Thai authorities attempted to defend the pegged exchange rate regime through substantial foreign exchange intervention, which drained a significant fraction of official reserves and still failed to achieve the desired goal."
32,"In contrast, the major Latin American countries raised interest rates significantly as soon as they were hit by the shock waves from the crisis."
33,"More generally, Thailand's experience highlights the fact that a half-hearted defense of a fixed exchange rate regime may drain reserves, reduce the credibility of the authorities, and ultimately prove unsuccessful."
34,"Accordingly, an emerging consensus in the policymaking community suggests that, when fixed exchange rate regimes come under attack, they either should be abandoned as quickly as possible or defended with all available instruments, including aggressive monetary tightening."
35,"Although the Mexican authorities have raised interest rates at various times over the past two years to stabilize the peso, they nonetheless have allowed the peso to depreciate."
36,This suggests that the policies required to defend a pegged exchange rate--not to mention the disruptions that are endured when such pegs are blown out--may leave countries with this sort of regime more vulnerable to downturn when crises occur.
37,"Second, during times of crisis, flexible exchange rate regimes appear to have major advantages relative to more rigid regimes."
38,"Flexible regimes may provide additional room for maneuver, since adjustment to an adverse shock can come through exchange rate depreciation."
39,Flexible exchange rate regimes are also less costly to defend.
40,"Particularly, in the context of a fixed exchange rate regime, monetary policy should be tightened aggressively to defend the peg, or the regime should be abandoned."
