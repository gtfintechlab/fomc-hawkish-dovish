0,"Effects of the Pandemic on Women's Employment When considering the level of employment, I tend to focus on both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate."
1,Let's start with the unemployment rate.
2,"The economic and social distancing restrictions imposed at the onset of the pandemic resulted in enormous job losses, with the unemployment rate surging from 3.5 percent in February, which was a 50-year low, to 14.8 percent in April 2020."
3,"In February 2020, the unemployment rate for women was slightly lower than for men, but by April it had risen to 16.1 percent, compared to 13.6 percent for men."
4,"That difference continued only until September, but this statistic does not reveal the fact that many women were leaving the workforce, and therefore not counted in unemployment."
5,"Their labor force participation fell more than the participation rate for men and at last count, there were two million fewer women in the labor force than before the pandemic.1 The difference in employment for men and women held true across some minority groups.2 Reasons Why the Pandemic Affected Women Differently So, what led to this decline in women's employment and what specific factors contributed to women's employment and their choice to leave the labor force?"
6,"Roughly a quarter of women worked in these jobs, compared with around 10 percent of men.3 This is one reason why female unemployment rose dramatically in comparison to male unemployment during the spring of 2020."
7,"The loss of these workers will limit the productive capacity of the economy, and may make it harder, or even impossible in the near term, to return to the high level of employment achieved before the pandemic."
8,"As the job market strengthens, many women, particularly minority women, say they are considering returning to the labor force.5 History tells us that the longer workers remain out of the workforce, the less likely it is that they will return to employment and the greater the likelihood that they will lose skills and connections with the job market, which could weigh on labor force participation and earnings for years to come."
9,"Even those who are working may face fewer opportunities to switch careers, or their employment and finances may be too tenuous to take time out to enhance their education or skills."
10,"While it's helpful to talk about the issues and their impact on women and employment, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss them, it is also necessary to encourage research on potential solutions."
