0,"Indeed, Delta disrupted both demand and supply."
1,"Single-family home construction permits declined again in August for the third consecutive month despite very strong housing demand, as builders faced shortages of materials."
2,"All told, private sector forecasters have revised down growth projections for 2021 over recent months by slightly more than 1 percentage point on average.3 Even with this Delta downgrade, I anticipate that growth this year and next will be sufficient such that by the end of next year, average annual growth since the onset of the crisis should exceed pre-crisis trend growth.4 The strength of the recovery despite the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID reflects powerful fiscal and monetary support and the resilience of American workers, businesses, and households."
3,Delta has also slowed progress on employment.
4,"As of the end of August, payroll employment remains over 5 million below pre-COVID levels and nearly 8-1/2 million below where it would have been in the absence of COVID."
5,Roughly one-third of the gap to pre-COVID employment levels is concentrated in the frontline leisure and hospitality sector.
6,"While the headline unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent in August, the unemployment rate adjusted for COVID-related nonparticipation remained elevated at 7.5 percent.5 The employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio for prime-age workers stood at 78 percent in Augustâ€”2.4 percentage points below its pre-COVID level.6 So overall, the labor market is making progress, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year.7 Relative to December, payrolls have closed nearly 50 percent of their gap to pre-COVID levels and the prime-age EPOP ratio has closed around 40 percent of the gap to pre-COVID conditions.8 In contrast, the labor force participation rate of 61.7 percent in August has shown little progress so far."
7,"Some observers argue that labor force participation has moved permanently lower, and the labor market is already tight, such that we should not expect a return to pre-COVID employment conditions."
8,"For instance, the number of respondents to the Census Household Pulse Survey indicating they were not working due to either being sick with COVID or caring for someone sick with COVID more than doubled between late July and early September, returning to levels seen early this year.9 While I am hopeful for improvements in the September employment report with the return to in-person education, the effects of Delta have likely prolonged caregiving constraints."
9,"Similarly, COVID-related challenges have reduced the availability of day care, preschool, and after-school care, further complicating parental return-to-work decisions.11 Research has shown that the pandemic has taken a significant toll on the labor market status of many mothers, particularly Black and Hispanic mothers, mothers with younger children, and mothers with lower incomes.12 With record-high job openings and an unemployment rate just above 5 percent, the headline vacancy-to-unemployed (V/U) ratio has risen above 1 vacancy per job seeker and is now at pre-pandemic levels."
10,Some cite this ratio of job openings to job seekers as indicating we are close to full employment.
11,"Although prime-age unemployment declined by less than half a percentage point over this period, that modest decline was accompanied by a 2 million increase in the prime-age labor force, which raised the prime-age EPOP ratio about 1-1/2 percentage points."
12,"Therefore, it is more informative to rely on a V/U ratio that adjusts the unemployment rate for pandemic-related nonparticipation and misclassification."
13,"After adjusting for pandemic-related nonparticipation, the ratio of job openings to job seekers was about 0.85 in Julyâ€”nearly one-third below the headline ratioâ€”and similar to levels last seen between 2014 and 2016â€”suggesting there is ample room for a full recovery in employment.13 The assertion that labor force participation has moved permanently lower as a result of a downturn is not new."
14,Research demonstrates that the labor force participation rate cycle lags that of the unemployment rate by years.
15,"So, it is important to consider indicators beyond the headline unemployment rate when assessing progress toward maximum employment, as participation gains might come late in the recovery for some groups.14 For these reasons, I see no reason employment should not reach levels as strong or stronger than before the pandemic."
16,Next let's consider price stability.
17,Inflation is currently elevated.
18,But the high inflation readings from the spring and early summer were disproportionately driven by a few sectors experiencing specific supply bottlenecks.
19,"In May and June, new and used vehicle prices accounted for half of the outsized monthly increases in core consumer price index (CPI) inflation."
20,"These categories were lesser contributors in July, and in the August CPI their joint contribution declined to essentially zero, as prices finally began to retreat for used cars, offsetting increases in new car prices."
21,I am closely monitoring incoming data for any indications that the breadth of inflation pressures is rising.
22,"Twenty-four-month core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation provides one approach to smoothing through the distortions from the pandemic: It is estimated to have been 2.5 percent in August, above the 2 percent target, but well below the 12-month measure."
23,The Dallas trimmed mean inflation measure provides another indicator of the breadth of inflation pressures: It came in at 2.0 percent in Julyâ€”well below the 12-month measure of core PCE inflation.15 The currently elevated level of inflation is driven by COVID-related disruptions.
24,"As these COVID-related disruptions subside, most forecasters expect inflation to move back down toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent long-run objective on its own."
25,That is the sense in which currently high inflation is likely to be transitory.
26,"So, I expect inflation to decelerate, and pre-COVID inflation dynamics to return when COVID disruptions dissipate."
27,"But with Delta disrupting the rotation from goods to services and prolonging supply bottlenecks, it is uncertain just how fast and how much inflation will decelerate over the remainder of the year and into next year."
28,"First, while rent and owners' equivalent rent both rose a moderate 0.3 percent in the August CPI data, if housing services inflation moved up substantially more than expected, it could provide durable upward pressure on inflation."
29,"Second, there is a risk that goods prices may not decelerate and return to pre-COVID trends as is widely expected, for instance, if excess savings or disruptions to services result in persistently elevated goods demand."
30,"Third, I will be watching for any signs that wage gains are feeding into higher inflation more broadly, but the evidence so far suggests that wage gains are broadly in line with productivity growth, and the labor share of income remains low relative to historical levels."
31,"To date, high markups and non-wage input costs appear to be more notable contributors to inflation than wage pressures."
32,"Finally, I am vigilant for any signs that the current high level of inflation might push longer-term inflation expectations above levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective."
33,Market-based measures of inflation compensation suggest inflation expectations remain well anchored.
34,"For instance, the five-year, five-year-forward CPI inflation compensation measure based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities has remained range bound around 2.2 percent since declining about 0.2 percentage point in Juneâ€”consistent with the FOMC's 2 percent objective for PCE inflation.16 Survey-based measures also suggest longer-run expectations remain well anchored."
35,"Recent analysis of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) concludes that ""in August 2021 consumers' five-year ahead inflation expectations were as well anchored as they were two years ago, before the start of the pandemic."
36,"""17 Longer-term inflation expectations in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers have moved mostly sideways in the past four to five months, and the current reading of the Federal Reserve Board index of common inflation expectations remains well within the range that prevailed before 2014."
37,"While one-year ahead measures in the SCE and the Michigan survey have seen large increases, these short-term measures tend to move with consumers' experience of contemporaneous inflation."
38,"Partly as a result, employment gains flatlined in August in the leisure and hospitality sector, where many of the job losses have occurred."
39,Payroll employment is now between 5 and 8-1/2 million short of where it would be in the absence of the pandemic.
40,The unemployment rate adjusted for pandemic-related nonparticipation is 7.5 percent.
41,Employment is still a bit short of the mark on what I consider to be substantial further progress.
42,"While inflation has been well above target for the past six months, affecting consumers and businesses alike, it previously spent roughly a quarter century below 2 percent."
43,"There are good reasons to expect a return to pre-COVID inflation dynamics due to the underlying structural features of a relatively flat Phillips curve, low equilibrium interest rates, and low underlying trend inflation."
44,"While the playbook for guiding inflation back down to target following a moderate overshoot is well tested and effective, experience suggests it is difficult to guide inflation up to target from below."
45,The forward guidance on maximum employment and average inflation sets a much higher bar for the liftoff of the policy rate than for slowing the pace of asset purchases.
46,"In implementing policy step by step, we must remain faithful to our new framework and attentive to changing conditions in order to ensure sufficient momentum as fiscal tailwinds shift to headwinds to achieve our maximum employment and inflation goals."
47,"For example, between the June and September publications of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, the consensus estimate for real GDP growth in 2021 fell from 6.7 percent to 5.9 percent."
48,"The median real GDP Q4/Q4 growth rates in the SEP of 5.9 percent for 2021 and 3.8 percent for 2022 imply an annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2022 of 2.4 percent, above the median SEP estimate of the long-run real GDP growth rate of 1.8 percent and above the top of the interquartile range of estimates from the most recent Survey of Primary Dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
49,"Like the U-3 unemployment rate provided by the BLS, the adjusted rate is also at a post-pandemic low."
