0,"Consequently, while any monetary policy decision has implications for achieving maximum employment, and I will address those implications in a moment, the FOMC is now, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
1,"We must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about recession lately, the evidence from the labor market indicates the economy is on track, while inflation continues to be far too high."
2,"It must be our focus because high inflation is the biggest challenge to sustaining our employment goal, and the greatest burden for individuals and families, especially lower- and moderate-income households that dedicate a larger share of their spending to necessities."
3,"Inflation has to be our focus, every meeting and every day, because the spending and pricing decisions people and businesses make every day depend on their expectations of future inflation, which in turn depend on whether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target."
4,"So let me be clear: I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce inflation and achieve our price stability goal, and today I will explain why I don't see that progress conflicting with our maximum-employment goal."
5,"Let me start with my view of the labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and conclude with where I think the economy is headed."
6,That isn't a picture of a weakening job market.
7,The unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent.
8,"It is often said that this is ""close to a half-century low"" and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 years, to 1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it was in June."
9,This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen.
10,"As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year."
11,"Turning to GDP, there are signs of slowing in economic activity."
12,"The Commerce Department estimates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter of the year, and ""nowcasting"" projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker, foresee a similar contraction in the second quarter.6 There is also softness in recent spending data, which has been widespread across consumer spending, business investment, housing, and government purchases, as well as some weaker indicators for the manufacturing sector and a deterioration in consumer sentiment, which by some measures are at historically low levels."
13,"But I don't see how that squares with the job creation data, the low unemployment rate, and overall strong labor market that I described earlier."
14,"Past experience has shown that job creation and the unemployment rate are timely indicators of a recession, more timely than quarterly GDP."
15,Persistently High Inflation Now let's talk about inflation.
16,Yesterday's report on the consumer price index (CPI) for June was a major league disappointment.
17,"On a twelve-month basis, total inflation stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years."
18,"No matter how you look at the data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down toward our 2 percent target."
19,"We know that supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market, have contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing."
20,"We also know that the surge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving, significant fiscal stimulus, and accommodative monetary policy also has contributed to the high inflation we are now experiencing."
21,There is some research estimating how much of this inflation came from supply problems and how much from high demand.7 The main point is that both played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year.
22,"But the causes of inflation don't affect my approach to policy because in writing the FOMC's mandate, Congress did not say ""Your goal is price stability unless inflation is caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook."""
23,"We want to reduce excessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or demand, high inflation can push up longer-run inflation expectations and thus affect spending and pricing decisions in the near term."
24,These decisions can then push up prices even more and make inflation harder to get under control.
25,I pay attention to both surveys of the public's inflation expectations and measures of inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation-indexed securities.
26,"The Board staff combines various surveys and market-based measures in our Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after being flat for a long time."
27,We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they become a factor that drives inflation higher.
28,"The Path of Monetary Policy So, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have described, let's talk about the implications for monetary policy."
29,That size increase was not an over-reaction to one data point on inflationâ€”it was primarily the response to a sequence of excessively high inflation readings since the beginning of the year.
30,It was appropriate given the lack of progress on inflation and clearly signals the FOMC's commitment to get inflation under control as soon as possible.
31,The response of financial markets to the FOMC's policy actions and communications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public confidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective.
32,"Longer-term interest rates have moved up to levels not far from those reflected in Committee members' estimates of the final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively implementing policy ahead of time."
33,"While there is some slowdown in home sales, lenders and borrowers are still doing business at these rates, which indicates that they believe the FOMC's policy intentions are credible, as broadly reflected in the interest rate paths in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)."
34,"As I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front-loading tightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts demand."
35,Getting there sooner will bolster the public's confidence that we can get inflation down and it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later if needed.
36,"I judge that level is close to neutral, by which I mean a level that neither stimulates nor restricts demand, assuming that the economy is growing moderately (at its potential) and unemployment is roughly where it is now."
37,If that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down.
38,"Based on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in the target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but that will depend on economic data in the coming weeks and months."
39,"Between the end of July and the FOMC's September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August."
40,I will be looking for signs that inflation has started its move down toward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.
41,"I anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the FOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come into a better balance."
42,"The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by continued improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors, and an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was before the pandemic."
43,"After the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand."
44,"Looking further in the future, I will need to see how the tightening this year is affecting the economy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
45,"Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect monetary policy to be restrictive until there has been a sustained reduction in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, which excludes food and energy."
46,"Food and energy prices tend to be volatile, so focusing on core PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term."
47,"Importantly, as futures prices for commoditiesâ€”food, energy, raw materialsâ€”have declined recently, I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months."
48,"But until I see a significant moderation in core prices, I support further rate hikes."
49,"In talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on where it is right now."
50,"I mentioned the concept of a ""neutral"" interest rate, and the belief that the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after another 75-basis point increase at the end of this month."
51,"But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate."
52,"In my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending decisions."
53,"This means taking into consideration longer-term real rates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several years."
54,"Based on trading in inflation-indexed Treasury securities of different maturities (compared to nominal Treasury securities), investors see federal funds rates above expected inflation starting about six months from now and steepening thereafter."
55,This gives me some confidence that tightening now anticipated by markets and expected by FOMC participants will be sufficient to reduce demand and inflation.
56,Evolution of the Economy The FOMC's plan for getting inflation under control depends on a view of the economic outlook.
57,"With a policy path like what I described for this year and a bit more tightening next year, the median SEP respondent projected that total PCE inflation is expected to fall from its current elevated level today to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024."
58,"At the same time, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to 3.7 percent at the end of this year and to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024, while GDP would grow below its long-run trend for the next two years."
59,I say this based on the optimistic view I expressed earlier about the strength of the labor market and on my analysis of the relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate.
60,"In a recent speech, I noted that we have an historically high number of job vacancies compared to the number of unemployed people.9 Some people have argued that past experience indicates we cannot reduce this large number of vacancies without a big increase in the unemployment rate."
61,"But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants."
62,"However, for the reasons I have laid out, and considering the evidence on the state of the economy and the outlook, I don't find it difficult to reaffirm my strong conviction that continued policy tightening will be appropriate to move inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
