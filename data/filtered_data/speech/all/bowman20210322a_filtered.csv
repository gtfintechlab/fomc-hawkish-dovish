2,"Our nation has made considerable progress since COVID-19 hit the economy with great force a year ago, but we still have further to go, and risks remain.1 As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression."
3,We also cut short-term interest rates to near zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses.
4,"Calm was restored in financial markets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill."
5,Rapid progress over the summer gave way to slower growth over the past winter as COVID-19 infection rates surged.
6,"The pace of vaccinations has accelerated, COVID-related restrictions on economic activity are beginning to ease, and the latest round of stimulus is boosting consumer spending."
7,"Most of my FOMC colleagues expect the economy to grow between 5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2021, and the median projection is that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.5 percent by the end of the year."
8,My own expectation is for strong growth and a rebound in the labor force participation rate once the economy fully reopens.
9,"As of February, the level of payroll employment is still 9-1/2 million below the pre-pandemic peak and more than 11 million below where it would have been based on the trend before the pandemic."
10,"I believe that job creation will continue, but I still see considerable uncertainty about the strength of that improvement and how long it may take to reach the Federal Reserve's maximum-employment goal."
11,"While the headline unemployment rate has continued to fall, the number of people who report being unemployed for more than six months has continued to rise, suggesting a risk of scarringâ€”meaning that some individuals could see an erosion of their skills and their connections to the labor market."
12,"Although economic activity in the travel, leisure, and hospitality sectors has continued to lag the recovery, there have been some bright spots elsewhere."
13,"Commodity prices for some crops have increased dramatically in the past few months, particularly soybeans and corn, reflecting higher export demand and some limits on global supply."
14,Increased prices are providing better cash flow and improved credit terms for farmers.
15,"Agricultural manufacturers and other suppliers are reporting order backlogs through the summer months, and there are some reports of firmer or increased prices for farmland."
16,"Meanwhile, the recent surge in oil prices has returned West Texas Intermediate back up near the levels of early 2020, when it began to fall sharply."
17,The rebound in prices reflects the improved outlook for the global economy given significant progress toward widespread vaccinations in many countries.
18,"So far this year, retail gasoline prices have been rising sharply, and the North American rig count is now the highest it has been since last April."
19,"The bankers I speak with have also noted that, while monetary policy has successfully delivered favorable borrowing conditions, many firms are reluctant to take on debt or additional borrowing because of the highly uncertain business climate."
20,Recent data from the from the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices tell a similar story: The January edition of that survey showed a majority of banks reporting weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans to firms of all sizes.
21,"For one, it is because the roughly 32 million small businesses in the United States comprise an important source of job growth in the macroeconomy, and they have an outsized impact on their local communities."
22,"This, as I see it, is why the potential for a wave of small business failures is one of the main risks to my expectation that our economy will make further substantial progress toward our goal of full employment."
23,"As I look further down the road, there are some tentative signs that the pickup in overall economic activity will eventually bring an improvement in conditions for small businesses."
24,"I spoke earlier about employment, and I will now turn to the price-stability side of the Fed's mandated goals for monetary policy."
25,"In recent months, we have seen consumer price inflation moving up, and I anticipate that the 12-month rates in the next few months will very likely track above our 2 percent benchmark as the unusual softness in prices that we saw in April and May last year drops out of the calculation."
26,The marked rise in food prices over the past 12 months has also pushed up the headline measures of price inflation.
27,"For many other categories of consumer goods, high order backlogs and tight supplies of key production inputsâ€”like lumber and semiconductorsâ€”as well as logjams at the nation's ports and a shortage of truck drivers are likely to push up prices over the next several months."
28,"Beyond this year, some observers have expressed concern that a rapid recovery in aggregate demand amid substantial fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy could lead to undesirably high inflation."
29,"While I expect that the stronger economy will push up inflation somewhat, let me explain why I do not expect pricing pressures to be excessive and why I believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue supporting the economy for some time through accommodative monetary policy."
30,"Here I will point to what has in the past seemed to be a relationship between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve."
31,"Over the past several decades, despite large swings in unemployment, inflation has been extremely stable."
32,"As an example, up to the beginning of the pandemic, when the economy was growing and unemployment was at a 50 year low of 3.5 percent, inflation was still very low and stable."
33,Economists often attribute this so-called flat Phillips curve to the fact that individuals' inflation expectations are well anchored and unlikely to respond to short-term pricing movements.
34,Survey data on long-run inflation expectations tend to back up this idea.
35,"With all of that said, given our lack of historical experience with both this level of substantial fiscal stimulus and highly accommodative monetary policy, my outlook for inflation is fairly uncertain."
36,"When making monetary policy decisions, we would be concerned about a significant increase in inflation above our 2 percent goal that was sustained for some time."
37,"But as my Fed colleagues and I have said many times, monetary policy is not on a preset course."
38,"I will continue to monitor economic developments carefully, and, if my outlook for inflation were to change materially, my assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy would change as well."
39,"Last year's sharp contraction in economic activity was like nothing we had seen before, and we are still assessing its impact."
40,What does all of this mean for the outlook for monetary policy?
41,"As we indicated in the policy statement released last week, my FOMC colleagues and I expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until employment and inflation achieve levels consistent with our maximum employment and inflation goals."
