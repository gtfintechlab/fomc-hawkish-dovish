0,Adding to the intense forces weighing on asset prices and economic activity before September 11 were new sources of uncertainty and risk that began to press down on global demand for goods and services.
1,"Indeed, for a short period, in response to that shock, U.S. economic activity did drop dramatically."
2,"Moreover, the relative stability of industrial commodity prices in recent weeks, and especially the recent firmness in the prices of semiconductors, could be hinting at less intense stock drawdowns."
3,A slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately.
4,But that impetus to activity will be short lived unless the demand for goods and services itself starts to rise.
5,"On that score, despite a number of encouraging signs of stabilization, it is still premature to conclude that the forces restraining economic activity here and abroad have abated enough to allow a steady recovery to take hold."
6,"For that to happen, sustained growth of final demand must kick in before the positive effects of the swing from inventory liquidation to accumulation dissipate."
7,"For the household sector, which had been a major stabilizing force through most of last year's slowdown, the outlook for demand is mixed."
8,Low mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have provided considerable support to homebuilding in recent months.
9,"The substantial declines in the prices of natural gas, fuel oil, and gasoline have clearly provided some support to real disposable income and spending."
10,These price declines added more than $50 billion at an annual rate to household purchasing power in the second half of last year.
11,"However, a decline in energy prices provides, in effect, only a one-shot boost to consumption, albeit one that is likely to take place over time."
12,"To have a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of total personal consumption expenditures, energy prices would need to continue to decline."
13,"Futures prices do not suggest that such a decline is in the immediate offing, but the forecast record of these markets is less than sterling."
14,"Although the quantitative magnitude and precise timing of the wealth effect remain uncertain, the steep decline in stock prices since March 2000 has, no doubt, curbed the growth of household spending."
15,"Although stock prices recently have retraced a portion of their earlier losses, the restraining effects from the net decline in equity values presumably have not, as yet, fully played out."
16,Future wealth effects will depend importantly on whether corporate earnings improve to the extent currently embedded in share prices.
17,"The pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after September 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply."
18,"Over the past month or so, however, initial claims for unemployment insurance have declined markedly, on balance, suggesting some abatement in the rate of job loss."
19,"Although this development would be welcome, the unemployment rate may well continue to rise for a time, and job losses can be expected to put something of a damper on consumer spending."
20,"However, the extent of that restraint will depend on how much of any rise in unemployment is the result of weakened demand and how much reflects strengthened productivity."
21,"In the latter case, average real incomes could rise, at least partially offsetting losses of purchasing power that stem from diminished levels of employment."
22,"Moreover, despite the failure of Congress to enact further tax cuts and spending increases, the continued phase-in of earlier reductions in taxes and the significant expansion of discretionary spending already enacted should provide noticeable short-term stimulus to demand."
23,"Some of this stimulus has likely been offset by increases in long-term market interest rates, including those on home mortgages."
24,"But over the past year, some of the firmness of long-term interest rates probably is the consequence of the fall of projected budget surpluses and the implied less-rapid paydowns of Treasury debt."
25,"In our conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve responded to the weakening economy over the past year by markedly lowering our target for the federal funds rate."
26,"Moreover, the magnitude of policy adjustment and the resulting low level of the federal funds rate responded both to the strength of the forces restraining demand and to the continued subdued pace of underlying inflation."
27,"Liquidity, as a consequence, has expanded significantly, and the accompanying lower interest rates have supported spending and held down the cost to households of servicing debts."
28,The dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook in coming months.
29,"The demand for many of the newer technologies was growing rapidly, but capacity was expanding even faster, exerting severe pressure on prices and profits."
30,"These cutbacks in capital spending interacted with, and were reinforced by, falling profits and equity prices."
31,"In this low-inflation environment, firms have perceived very little capability to pass cost increases on to customers."
32,"Growth in hourly labor compensation has slowed in response to deteriorating economic conditions, but even those smaller increases have continued to outstrip gains in output per hour for the corporate sector on a consolidated basis."
33,"Business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces."
34,"When capital spending eventually recovers, its growth is likely to be less frenetic than that which characterized 1999 and early 2000, when outlays were boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the extraordinarily low cost of capital faced by many firms."
35,"Importantly, as I suggested shortly after the event, adjustments to new levels of perceived risk will cause a one-time downward shift in the level of productivity."
36,"In any event, once these adjustments are completed, the full benefits of more rapid technological advance should show through to the growth of productivity."
37,"And even when they are anticipated, their effect on economic growth is difficult to predict, in part because their pace of diffusion and application is so uncertain."
38,The latter consideration is particularly significant to the longer-term rate of growth of productivity.
39,"For example, as recently as a decade ago, the outlook was for a continuation of meager gains in output per hour, with the rate of growth barely exceeding one percent per year, if that."
40,"Instead, during the last half of the 1990s, we experienced a surge in productivity growth well above the rate of increase experienced in the previous quarter-century."
41,"Even as our economy slipped into recession, the growth of output per hour remained positive and, as I indicated earlier, has held up well even in the wake of September 11."
42,"Until last year, the hypothesis of an accelerated productivity trend had not been tested in the contracting phase of a business cycle."
43,"Profits and investment remain weak and, as I noted, household spending is subject to restraint from the backup in interest rates, possible increases in unemployment, and from the effects of widespread equity asset price deflation over the past two years."
