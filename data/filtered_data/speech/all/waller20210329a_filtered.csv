0,One of my main fields of inquiry was monetary policy theory.
1,"The Federal Reserve took a host of actions, including lowering its policy rate to zero and purchasing securities to support market functioning and provide monetary accommodation.2 The Congress enacted several packages that funded the health response to the pandemic, expanded unemployment insurance, and provided economic assistance payments to households and businesses.3 The virus also created uncertainty and turbulence in financial markets, which led the Federal Reserve to establish emergency lending programs to serve as lending backstops and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments.4 Establishing these programs under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act required substantial cooperation between the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve."
2,"Because of the large fiscal deficits and rising federal debt, a narrative has emerged that the Federal Reserve will succumb to pressures (1) to keep interest rates low to help service the debt and (2) to maintain asset purchases to help finance the federal government."
3,Monetary policy has not and will not be conducted for these purposes.
4,My colleagues and I will continue to act solely to fulfill our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.
5,The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) determines the appropriate monetary policy actions solely to move the economy towards those goals.
6,Deficit financing and debt servicing issues play no role in our policy decisions and never will.
7,"To understand this point, consider a situation where the economy is hit with a negative shock that depresses aggregate demand."
8,The Macro 101 textbook policy response we teach students is for the monetary and fiscal authorities to enact stimulative policies to increase aggregate demand.
9,"This effort involves fiscal actions, such as increasing spending and cutting taxes, which increase the deficit."
10,The finance ministry's job is to finance the deficit that results from these fiscal policy actions.
11,"Greater borrowing by the finance ministry to finance these policies will tend to put upward pressure on interest rates, which crowds out private sector spending."
12,"In this textbook example, the monetary authority should respond to this upward pressure on interest rates by adopting a more accommodative policy stance to bring rates back down."
13,One obvious solution would be to give the finance ministry control of monetary policy to ensure a coordinated policy response.
14,"In the situation where monetary policy is under control of the Treasury, and thus the executive branch in the United States, political motivations may influence decisions."
15,"To return to my stabilization example, as the economy recovers, with all of the monetary and fiscal stimulus in place, this stimulus may lead to undesirable inflation pressures."
16,The standard monetary policy response is to evaluate the current employment and inflation situations and raise interest rates when deemed appropriate.
17,"However, if monetary policy is under the control of the Treasury, then to further juice the economy for short-term political gains, this action could be delayed past the date the central bank would want to raise rates."
18,"Consequently, the argument goes that a hot economy may cause substantial inflation pressures that are hard to rein in politically, and which ultimately harm Americans in the longer run."
19,"This view is backed up by the political economy literature, which argues that having monetary policy under the control of political authorities may lead to excessive inflation and economic volatility that is not socially optimal.11 Put another way, it can lead to an unstable economy, on which households and businesses cannot rely."
20,"Operational independence with clearly specified goals for monetary policy has become the norm for central banks in advanced economies, reflecting the consensus that has emerged over the past 30 years concerning the benefits of central bank independence."
21,"The Congress was fully aware of the potential misuse of monetary policy for political reasons, and it purposefully created the Federal Reserve as an independent central bank."
22,"The design features of the Federal Reserve minimize political influence over monetary policy while still maintaining accountability to the Congress and to the electorate for its policy actions.13 Eventually, in 1977, the Congress mandated that the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy to effectively promote the goals of maximum employment and price stability."
23,"By having monetary policy overseen by independent officials, the incentive to misuse stabilization policy for partisan purposes is reduced."
24,"Monetary policymakers can focus on what is best for the economy over the long run.14 Finally, we come to the third area of potential interaction between the central bank and the Treasury: debt financing."
25,Money earmarked to make interest payments could be used for other purposes if interest rates were lower.
26,"Thus, the fiscal authority has a strong incentive to keep interest rates low."
27,"The United States faced this situation during World War II.15 Marriner Eccles, who chaired the Federal Reserve at the time, favored financing the war by coupling tax increases with wage and price controls."
28,"So the U.S. government ran up a substantial amount of debt to fund the war effort in a low interest rate environment, allowing the Treasury to have low debt servicing costs."
29,"After the war was over and victory was achieved, the Treasury still had a large stock of debt to manage and still had control over interest rates."
30,"The postwar boom in consumption, along with excessively low interest rates, led to a burst of inflation."
31,"Without control over interest rates, the Federal Reserve could not enact the appropriate interest rate policies to rein in inflation."
32,"As a result, prices increased 41.8 percent from January 1946 to March 1951, or an average of 6.3 percent year over year.16 This trend, and efforts by then-Chair Thomas McCabe and then-Board member Eccles, ultimately led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which restored interest rate policy to the Federal Reserve."
33,"The purpose of the accord was to ensure that interest rate policy would be implemented to ensure the proper functioning of the economy, not to make debt financing cheap for the U.S. government."
34,"But research shows that, to avoid distortions in using monetary policy for deficit financing, it is important to have an independent central bank with a clear and credible inflation target, which the Federal Reserve does.17 Central bank independence is critical for maintaining that target and keeping inflation expectations in line with that target."
