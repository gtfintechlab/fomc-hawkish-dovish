0,"Any analysis of the amount and type of saving required to finance the bulge in retirements that is just over the horizon needs to project (1) the number of retirees, (2) the size of our workforce, and (3) the productivity of that workforce."
1,"Of the three, productivity is most directly affected by the level of investment, which, of course, is financed by saving."
2,"But it surely affects capital investment, which it finances, and the productivity that it engenders."
3,"Besides the total amount of saving and investment, changes in the allocation of those funds among different types of capital also appear to have some influence on the growth of labor productivity."
4,"Clearly, firms' choices about the types of investments to make matter crucially for how much labor productivity ultimately is boosted."
5,Businesses made this shift and are continuing to move further in that direction in response to the extremely rapid decline in the prices of high-tech assets and the new opportunities that these assets have afforded.
6,"According to one set of calculations, of the roughly 2-1/2 percent annual rate of increase in output per hour, or labor productivity, between 1995 and 2001, perhaps a quarter of that growth could be attributed to on-going shifts in the composition, as distinct from the dollar level, of capital."
7,Improvements in the quantity and quality of education of our workforce enhance workers' skills and contribute importantly to the growth of labor productivity.
8,"Notwithstanding these more intangible contributions, the level of saving remains a key ingredient of economic growth."
9,"But we need also to know whether the source of that saving is sustainable, and beyond that, whether the type of financial assets in which our saving overall is accumulated affects our productivity."
10,"This situation is reflected in our ongoing current account deficit, which, by definition, is a measure of our net investment in domestic plant and equipment financed with foreign funds, both debt and equity."
11,"But this deficit is also a measure of the increase in the level of net claims, primarily debt claims, that foreigners have on our assets."
12,"Eventually, the current account deficit will have to be restrained."
13,Whether the mix of domestic private and government saving affects the rate of productivity growth is a more contentious issue.
14,"Another is whether the form of private saving, for example, whether in stocks or debt instruments including bank deposits, affects productivity growth."
15,"In response to these reduced penalties on risk, firms will eventually adjust the mix of their endeavors toward more-speculative projects--but, importantly, presumably ones that also offer higher prospective rates of return on average, which more often than not translate into higher long-term average economic growth."
16,"Indeed, many are clearly willing to forgo the higher long-term rates of return on equity for the greater tranquility of the lesser risk associated with most debt instruments--in effect forsaking more economic growth for a more stable, less stressful, economic environment."
17,The answer to whether government or private saving does more to foster productivity growth arguably thus comes down to the propensity to take risks by U.S. savers.
18,"That inducement will occur as relative preferences shift toward debt instruments and away from equity, thereby driving interest rates lower and earnings price ratios higher."
19,"Presumably, most of those who maintain that greater risk-taking would likely produce faster long-term growth would also acknowledge that increased competition and economic growth would bring greater volatility and social stress."
20,"Because of the near certainty of a major rise in the retiree-to-worker ratio in the next few decades, we now face the major challenge of setting policies for enhanced economic growth."
21,Is the level compatible with the level of domestic saving and possibly the risk-taking that is consonant with the elevated level of productivity growth necessary to meet the needs of an aging population?
