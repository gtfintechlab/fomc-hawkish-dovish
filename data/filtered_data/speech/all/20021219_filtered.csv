1,"And, in the four decades after that, prices quintupled."
2,"Monetary policy, unleashed from the constraint of domestic gold convertibility, had allowed a persistent overissuance of money."
3,"As recently as a decade ago, central bankers, having witnessed more than a half-century of chronic inflation, appeared to confirm that a fiat currency was inherently subject to excess."
4,But the adverse consequences of excessive money growth for financial stability and economic performance provoked a backlash.
5,"The Federal Reserve, under the leadership of Paul Volcker and with the support of both the Carter and the Reagan Administrations, dramatically slowed the growth of money."
6,"Initially, the economy fell into recession and inflation receded."
7,"However, most important, when activity staged a vigorous recovery, the progress made in reducing inflation was largely preserved."
8,"By the end of the 1980s, the inflation climate was being altered dramatically."
9,"The record of the past twenty years appears to underscore the observation that, although pressures for excess issuance of fiat money are chronic, a prudent monetary policy maintained over a protracted period can contain the forces of inflation."
10,"With the story of most major economies in the postwar period being the emergence of, and then battle against inflation, concerns about deflation, one of the banes of an earlier century, seldom surfaced."
11,The recent experience of Japan has certainly refocused attention on the possibility that an unanticipated fall in the general price level would convert the otherwise relatively manageable level of nominal debt held by households and businesses into a corrosive rising level of real debt and real debt service costs.
12,"It now appears that we have learned that deflation, as well as inflation, are in the long run monetary phenomena, to extend Milton Friedman's famous dictum."
13,"To be sure, in the short to medium run, many forces are at play that complicate the link between money and prices."
14,These shifts in aggregate supply--whether foreign or domestic in origin--influence the relationship between money and prices.
15,"Moreover, the tie between money and prices can be altered by dysfunctional financial intermediation, as we have witnessed in Japan."
16,The meaning of deflation and the characteristics that differentiate it from the more usual experience of inflation are subjects being actively studied inside and outside of central banks.
17,* * * * * Central bankers have long believed that price stability is conducive to achieving maximum sustainable growth.
18,"Historically, debilitating risk premiums have tended to rise with both expected inflation and deflation, and they have been minimized during conditions of approximate price stability."
19,"Although the U.S. economy has largely escaped any deflation since World War II, there are some well-founded reasons to presume that deflation is more of a threat to economic growth than is inflation."
20,"For one, the lower bound on nominal interest rates at zero threatens ever-rising real rates if deflation intensifies."
21,"A related consequence is that even if debtors are able to refinance loans at zero nominal interest rates, they may still face high and rising real rates that cause their balance sheets to deteriorate."
22,"If lower price inflation is accompanied by lower average wage inflation, then the prevalence of nominal wages being constrained from falling could increase as price inflation moves toward or below zero."
23,"In these circumstances, the effective clearing of labor markets would be inhibited, with the consequence being higher rates of unemployment."
24,"Taken together, these considerations suggest that deflation could well be more damaging than inflation to economic growth."
25,"In particular, more rapid advances in productivity can make this asymmetry less severe."
26,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth."
27,"Moreover, to the extent that more-rapid growth of productivity shows through to faster gains in nominal wages, there will be fewer instances in which nominal wages will be pressured to fall."
28,One also should not overstate the difficulties posed for monetary policy by the zero bound on interest rates and nominal wage inflexibility even in the absence of faster productivity growth.
29,This authority could be used to lower interest rates at longer maturities.
30,"But if deflation were to develop, options for an aggressive monetary policy response are available."
31,"* * * * * Certainly, lurking in the background of any evaluation of deflation risks is the concern that those forces could be unleashed by a bursting bubble in asset prices."
32,"This connection, real or speculative, raises some interesting questions about the most effective approach to the conduct of monetary policy."
33,Destabilizing macroeconomic policies and poor economic performance are not likely to provide fertile ground for the optimism that usually accompanies surging asset prices.
34,"Ironically, low inflation, economic stability, and low risk premiums may provide tinder for asset price speculation that could be sparked should technological innovations open up new opportunities for profitable investment."
35,"To be sure, the stock prices of old-line companies do rise somewhat through arbitrage when the market as a whole is propelled higher by stock prices of cutting-edge technologies."
36,But it is difficult to imagine stock prices of most well-established and seasoned old-line companies surging to wholly unsustainable heights.
37,"Moreover, skeptics find it too expensive or too risky to short sell the shares of such a company, especially when its stock price is rising rapidly."
38,The conditions of extended low inflation and low risk were combined with breakthrough technologies to produce the bubble of recent years.
39,Investors are likely to be sensitive to the need for asset prices to be backed ultimately by an ongoing stream of earnings.
40,* * * * * Most standard macroeconomic models fitted to the experience of recent decades imply that a distortion in valuation ratios induced by a bubble can be offset by adopting a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy.
41,"According to such models, a tighter monetary policy, on average, credibly constrains demand and lowers asset prices, all else being equal."
42,These models can also be interpreted to suggest that incremental monetary tightening can gradually deflate stock prices.
43,"As I related this summer at the annual Jackson Hole symposium sponsored by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, ""...our experience over the past fifteen years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices....Such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble."
44,"""2 In short, unless a model can be specified to capture the apparent market tendency toward bidding stock prices higher in response to monetary policies aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, the accompanying forecasts will belie recent experience."
45,"""3 The Federal Open Market Committee chose, as you know, to embark on an aggressive course of monetary easing two years ago once it became apparent that a variety of forces, including importantly the slump in household wealth that resulted from the decline in stock prices, were restraining inflation pressures and economic activity."
46,The contractionary impulse from the decline in equity prices appeared to be diminishing around the middle of this year.
47,"But then the fallout for stock prices from corporate governance malfeasance, argued by some as having been spawned by the bubble, became more intense."
48,"More recently, of course, geopolitical risk has risen markedly, further weighing on demand."
49,"If the postmortem of recent monetary policy shows that the results of addressing the bubble only after it bursts are unsatisfactory, we would be left with less-appealing choices for the future."
50,"Thus, it was disturbing to observe risk seemingly being priced so cheaply in late 1997 when BBB corporate spreads over ten-year Treasuries sunk to only 70 basis points."
51,* * * * * Weaving a monetary policy path through the thickets of bubbles and deflations and their possible aftermath is not something with which modern central bankers have had much experience.
52,"As I noted earlier, it seems ironic that a monetary policy that is successful in inducing stability may inadvertently be sowing the seeds of instability associated with asset bubbles."
53,I trust that the use by the central bank of deliberately inflationary policy as protection against bubbles can be readily dismissed.
54,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy."
55,"Moderate inflation might possibly inhibit bubbles, though at some cost of reduced economic efficiency."
56,"The list is rather impressive: First, a halving of stock prices and household equity wealth; second, a dramatic decline in capital expenditures; third, the tragic events of September 11; fourth, the disturbing evidence of corporate malfeasance; and fifth, the recent escalation of geopolitical risks."
57,"The recovery, however, ran into resistance in the summer, apparently as a consequence of a renewed weakening in equity prices, further revelations of corporate malfeasance, and then the heightened geopolitical risks."
58,"Although our most probable forecast already was that growth would pick up, we judged the cost of the insurance provided by additional easing as exceptionally modest because we viewed the risk of an imminent rise in inflation as remote."
59,"Oil prices have recently risen and, not least, the economies of most of our major trading partners have shown little vigor."
60,"Still, low interest rates and rapid advances in productivity have been providing considerable support to economic activity."
61,"More broadly, strong growth of labor productivity, supplemented by reduced tax payments, has provided a boost both to incomes and to spending."
62,"Meanwhile, new home sales have been buoyed by low mortgage interest rates as well as favorable demographics."
63,"Cash borrowed in the process of mortgage refinancing, an important support for consumer outlays this past year, is bound to contract at some point, as average interest rates on households' total mortgage portfolio converges to interest rates on new mortgages."
64,"Stock prices have, on net, moved up, and corporate yield spreads, especially for below-investment-grade debt instruments, have narrowed significantly."
65,"Profit margins have been running a little higher this year than last, aided importantly by strong growth in labor productivity."
66,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average."
67,"Indeed, one of the most remarkable features of the performance of the U.S. economy over the past year had been the extraordinary gains in productivity."
68,"That pace will not likely be sustained, but it suggests that the underlying supports to productivity growth have not yet fully played out."
69,"Against that background, any significant fall in the current geopolitical and other risks should noticeably improve capital outlays, the indispensable spur to a path of increased economic growth."
