0,Our goal was to curb some of the most flagrant predatory lending abuses without impairing the growth of legitimate subprime lending.
1,"Because the imposition of HOEPA protections has not impeded the growth of that segment of the subprime market, one can reasonably expect that a modest tightening of the HOEPA terms should not impede it either."
2,"HOEPA defines ""high-cost"" loans in two ways: the APR exceeds the rate on a Treasury bond of comparable maturity (called the APR spread) by 10 percentage points or more the points and fees exceed 8 percent of the value of the loan, or $480 (a number that is indexed with consumer prices)."
3,"To modernize HMDA reporting, we made several changes: To facilitate enforcement and to improve data on the volume and pattern of HOEPA lending, we now require lenders to report whether a loan is subject to HOEPA, To close an obvious loophole in the HMDA reporting requirements, we require nonbank lenders to file HMDA reports if they make mortgage loans that total more than $25 million, To deal with the increasing rationing of credit by price rather than by outright denials, we require all lenders to report the APR spread over Treasuries of comparable maturity if it exceeds 3 percentage points for first-lien mortgages and 5 percentage points for second-lien mortgages, We now require lenders to report whether a loan involves a manufactured home for which loans are generally underwritten differently with much higher denial rates."
