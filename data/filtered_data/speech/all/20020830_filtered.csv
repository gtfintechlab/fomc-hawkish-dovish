0,"The aftermath of the Vietnam War and a series of oil shocks had left the United States with high inflation, lackluster productivity growth, and a declining competitive position in international markets."
1,"Securities analysts' expectations for long-term earnings growth, an assumed proxy for investors' expectations, were revised up significantly over the second half of the 1990s and into 2000.1 Over that same period, risk spreads on corporate bonds rose markedly on net, implying a rising probability of default."
2,"Hence, higher average expected earnings growth coupled with a rising probability of default implies a greater variance of earnings expectations, a consequence of a lengthened negative tail."
3,"Consistent with a greater variability of earnings expectations, volatility of stock prices has been elevated in recent years."
4,The increased volatility of stock prices and the associated quickening of the adjustment process would also have been expected to be accompanied by less volatility in real economic variables.
5,Stock prices rose in response to the greater propensity for risk-taking and to improved prospects for earnings growth that reflected emerging evidence of an increased pace of innovation.
6,The associated decline in the cost of equity capital spurred a pronounced rise in capital investment and productivity growth that broadened impressively in the latter years of the 1990s.
7,"Stock prices rose further, responding to the growing optimism about greater stability, strengthening investment, and faster productivity growth."
8,"But, as we indicated in congressional testimony in July 1999,2 ""... productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended."
9,"There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated."
10,That prospect has supported higher stock prices.
11,"The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small."
12,"Looking back on those years, it is evident that increased productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to price-earnings ratios."
13,"Between 1995 and 2000, the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 rose from 15 to nearly 30."
14,"However, to attribute that increase entirely to revised earnings expectations would require an upward revision to the growth of real earnings of 2 full percentage points in perpetuity.3 Because the real riskless rate of return apparently did not change much during that five-year period, anything short of such an extraordinary permanent increase in the growth of structural productivity, and thus earnings,4 implies a significant fall in real equity premiums in those years."
15,"If all of the drop in equity premiums had resulted from a permanent reduction in cyclical volatility, stock prices arguably could have stabilized at their levels in the summer of 2000."
16,"That clearly did not happen, indicating that stock prices, in fact, had risen to levels in excess of any economically supportable base."
17,"Toward the end of that year, expectations for long-term earnings growth began to turn down."
18,The consequent reversal in stock prices that has occurred over the past couple of years has been particularly pronounced in the high-tech sectors of the economy.
19,"Even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster."
20,"In light of the burgeoning supply, the pace of increased demand for the newer technologies, though rapid, fell short of that needed to sustain the elevated real rate of return for the whole of the high-tech capital stock."
21,* * * The struggle to understand developments in the economy and financial markets since the mid-1990s has been particularly challenging for monetary policymakers.
22,"We at the Federal Reserve considered a number of issues related to asset bubbles--that is, surges in prices of assets to unsustainable levels."
23,"Moreover, it was far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, could be preempted short of the central bank inducing a substantial contraction in economic activity--the very outcome we would be seeking to avoid."
24,"Prolonged periods of expansion promote a greater rational willingness to take risks, a pattern very difficult to avert by a modest tightening of monetary policy."
25,"In fact, our experience over the past fifteen years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices."
26,"For example, stock prices rose following the completion of the more than 300-basis-point rise in the federal funds rate in the twelve months ending in February 1989."
27,"Stock prices initially flattened, but as soon as that round of tightening was completed, they resumed their marked upward advance."
28,"However, equity price increases were largely undeterred during that period despite what now, in retrospect, was the exhausted tail of a bull market.5 Such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble."
29,"From the evidence to date, the answer appears to be no.6 But we do need to know more about the behavior of equity premiums and bubbles and their impact on economic activity.7 The equity premium, computed as the total expected return on common stocks less that on riskless debt, prices the risk taken by investors in purchasing equities rather than risk-free debt."
30,Managers presumably employ market prices of debt and equity coupled with the calculated rate of return on particular real investment projects to determine the level of corporate investment.
31,"If managers and investors perceived the same degree of risk, and both correctly judged a sustainable rise in profits stemming from new technology, for example, none of a rise in stock prices would reflect a bubble."
32,The distinction cannot readily be ascertained from market prices.
33,"But the equity premium less the expected growth of dividends, and presumed earnings, can be estimated as the dividend yield less the real long-term interest rate on U.S. Treasuries.8 If equity premiums were redefined to include both the unrealistic part of profit projections and the unsustainably low segment of discount factors, and if we had associated measures of these concepts, we could employ this measure to infer emerging bubbles."
34,"That is, if we could substitute realistic projections of earnings and dividend growth, perhaps based on structural productivity growth and the behavior of the payout ratio, the residual equity premium might afford some evidence of a developing bubble."
35,Bubbles are often precipitated by perceptions of real improvements in the productivity and underlying profitability of the corporate economy.
36,"Human psychology being what it is, bubbles tend to feed on themselves, and booms in their later stages are often supported by implausible projections of potential demand."
37,Stock prices and equity premiums are then driven to unsustainable levels.
38,"As this happens, asset prices will gravitate back to levels that are in line with a sustainable path for earnings."
39,"As we delve deeper into the questions raised by the developments of recent years, the interplay between structural productivity growth and equity premiums, so evident during the past business cycle, is bound to play a prominent role."
40,The roughly twenty-year history of this series confirms a pronounced upward bias in these long-term projections of analysts of approximately 4 to 5 percentage points in annual expected growth.
41,"There is little evidence, however, one way or the other, of bias to changes in the rate of growth."
42,"For continuous discounting over an infinite horizon, k (E/P) = r + b - g, where k equals the current, and assumed future, dividend payout ratio, E current earnings, P the current stock price, r the riskless interest rate, b the equity premium, and g the growth rate of earnings."
43,"If earnings are a constant share of output in the long run, then real long-term earnings growth is the product of productivity growth and growth in labor force hours."
44,"In this exercise, the growth rate of hours, driven by demographics, is assumed not to change; hence, the growth rates of earnings and productivity are the same."
45,"Stock prices peaked in March 2000, but the market basically moved sideways until September of that year."
46,Some have asserted that the Federal Reserve can deflate a stock-price bubble--rather painlessly--by boosting margin requirements.
47,"Or, they can purchase options, which will affect stock prices given the linkages across markets."
48,"If so, the only effect of raised margin requirements is to price out the very small investor without addressing the broader issue of stock price bubbles."
49,"If a change in margin requirements were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank would soon tighten monetary policy enough to burst a bubble, then there might be the appearance of a causal effect."
50,"But it is the prospect of monetary policy action, not the margin increase, that should be viewed as the trigger."
51,"Equity prices rose sharply during the spring and summer, again despite the rise in short-term rates through late summer of that year."
52,"The price collapse clearly had some of the characteristics of prolonged and far larger bubbles, but stock prices quickly stabilized without significant effect on economic activity."
53,"And, in line with later episodes, the failure of the collapse to have an economic impact seems to have contributed to subsequent higher stock prices."
