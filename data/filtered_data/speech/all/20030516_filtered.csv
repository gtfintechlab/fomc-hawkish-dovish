0,"To my mind, the most important potential contribution of monetary policymakers is to anchor inflation expectations so that private-sector decisions can be made as efficiently as possible."
1,"We can do this because, as with any central bank, our control over the size of our balance sheet determines the value of our country's money and the general price level in the long run."
2,"We must do it because our enabling legislation directs the Federal Reserve to seek monetary conditions fostering ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
3,"That is, only in an environment of stable prices will households and firms be able to direct their complete attention to producing, investing, and saving so that employment will be at its maximum over the long run."
4,"And at the same time, when investors are not concerned about a generally rising level of prices for goods and services, inflation premiums will be compressed and long-term interest rates will be moderate."
5,"However, an environment of price stability is not one in which measured price indexes do not change."
6,"In fact, price indexes of consumer goods and services suffer from a variety of statistical biases that imply that the indexes overstate actual inflation."
7,"That is why, following Federal Reserve tradition, I speak of an environment of price stability, or a situation in which concerns about variations in the general price level do not materially influence the decisions of households and firms."
8,"The four-quarter growth in the core personal consumption deflator is currently running at a 1-1/2 percent rate, the slowest sustained pace in thirty years and 8 percentage points below its peak recorded in 1980."
9,"Think of it: Inflation has declined over the years--that is, we have experienced disinflation--to the point that increases in prices are now at a rate not seen on a sustained basis in the lifetimes of most of today's graduates."
10,This disinflation represents an impressive victory for the disciplined monetary policy of the Federal Reserve under the guidance first of Paul Volcker and then Alan Greenspan.
11,We will do that by always remembering that our mandate to foster price stability imposes a symmetric responsibility.
12,"Because resources are misused whenever the economy operates outside the zone of price stability, measured inflation can be too low at times as well as too high."
13,"In the quarters ahead and as noted at the conclusion of our policy meeting earlier this month, the Federal Reserve has to guard against further declines from the already low prevailing level of inflation."
14,"Nonetheless, the possibility that the process of disinflation will cumulate to the point that price levels actually decline for a sustained stretch of time--that is, we enter into deflation--remains quite remote."
15,"Quite simply, the United States has too many good things going for it to make a forecast of deflation credible, including the stimulus imparted by prior monetary policy easings, the marked decline in oil prices associated with decisive victory in the war against Iraq, the progress many households and firms have made in repairing their balance sheets, and the fact that inflation expectations remain well anchored."
16,"In discussing the fundamentals supporting economic expansion, I particularly want to single out the impressive growth of labor productivity."
17,Faster productivity growth implies that workers can look forward to more rapidly rising real wages over time.
18,But we must also remember the unpleasant arithmetic attached to those gains in productivity of late.
19,"Thus far in the economic recovery and expansion, firms have been able to meet increased demand for their products without adding workers."
20,I would not be credible before this audience if I did not recognize that some may have had trouble finding employment and a few may still be uncertain of their next job opportunity.
21,"Because aggregate supply can increase rapidly, aggregate demand also has to grow faster than its recent pace to ensure that economic slack does not build up."
22,"Indeed, given the existing level of slack in labor and product markets, the economy should be able to enjoy above-trend growth for some time without putting undue pressure on resources."
23,"Recognizing that the economy is experiencing price stability, I also accept that the central bank should work to create conditions conducive to closing the gap between output and the ability of our economy to produce, thereby fostering utilization of resources, including labor."
24,"The difficulties of prediction pose a challenge to monetary policymakers: We prefer to act in advance of, rather than in reaction to, economic developments so as to minimize disruptions to economic activity."
