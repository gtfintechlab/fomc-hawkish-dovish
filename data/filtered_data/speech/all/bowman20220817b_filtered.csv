4,The unemployment rates for men and women were essentially the same before the pandemic but ended up much higher for women.6 That was very different from past recessions.
5,"For example, after the recession following the housing crisis, unemployment for prime working age men rose to 11 percent, compared to only 9 percent for prime age women.7 The women's labor force participation rate is another way to measure their presence in the workforce."
