2,"We're involved in community economic development because we recognize that economic recovery, growth, and stability depend on job creation and the development of diversified and robust regional markets."
3,"Small businesses employ nearly 40 percent of the private sector workforce, making them a key component of the job market and a building block of the economy."
4,There is also less demand for credit by sound firms.
5,"We have acted on multiple fronts by instituting accommodative monetary policy, expanding existing liquidity programs for depository institutions, and establishing new liquidity facilities to support market functioning."
6,"Notably, overall economic conditions, the most important determinant of the demand for and availability of small business lending, have improved considerably since the early and middle part of last year."
7,"Hit hard by the loss of businesses and employment, much retail, office, and industrial space stands vacant."
8,"In this environment, a turnaround in CRE is likely to lag the improvement in overall economic activity."
9,"Your efforts to revive employment, retail sales, and business capital expenditures in your communities will be key to the recovery of commercial real estate values."
10,"But before I get to them, let me provide some recent data on the grim employment picture that makes the success of such strategies so critical."
11,The unemployment rate has held at 9.7 percent for the past few months and job market conditions remain weak.
12,"While job growth in March may be the first welcome sign that the worst is over in terms of job loss, approximately 8 million jobs have been lost in the past three years, and it will take sustained, robust job growth for some time to return all those workers to jobs."
13,Other indicators also suggest a challenging employment picture ahead.
14,"3 So far, most of the stabilization in the unemployment rate has come from a sharp reduction in layoffs and terminations."
15,Aggressive moves by businesses to reduce costs by cutting jobs and work hours have resulted in solid gains in aggregate productivity.
16,"This bodes well for increased employment in the coming year, but I anticipate that employers will add jobs cautiously in order to preserve these cost savings and efficiency gains for as long as possible."
17,It is important to note that unemployment is not distributed evenly across all segments of the population.
18,"Men, young workers, and low-skilled job seekers are disproportionately affected by current job losses.4 Most notably for purposes of this discussion, the prolonged unemployment of so many low-skill workers, in particular, is increasing the demand for training and education."
19,"Retraining workers to acquire the skills demanded in today's job market is an ongoing challenge as employment shifts away from low-skill manufacturing toward the service sector, technology, and health care."
20,The recent economic crisis and the rise in unemployment have only made the need to retrain workers more urgent.
21,Effective workforce development is necessary to ensure that workers have the skills they need to find new employment and that communities have a consistent supply of well-qualified workers to remain competitive.
22,Traditional workforce development strategies include pre-employment training and job placement to help low- and moderate-income people transition from one job to another.
23,"Given the current unemployment rate, governments and community organizations have understandably focused on projects and programs that will create new jobs and ensure that workers are available to fill them."
24,Skill gaps could constrain long-term employment growth.
25,"And, as I noted, longer average duration of unemployment may be eroding the skills of the jobless.5 While broad investments in human capital and workforce development are clearly needed, it is not easy to determine how to ensure that those investments are effective and cost-efficient."
26,"In its report, The Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America, published in 2008, findings from 16 case studies confirmed that a skilled labor force is a key attraction for other drivers of community success, including lower crime rates, outside investment, and access to employment."
27,"As a result, many of the case study communities actively promote strategies that address barriers to work and connect adults to employment opportunities.6 Among the successful strategies identified in the concentrated poverty case studies, the report noted that community colleges have effectively filled educational gaps in communities where limited educational attainment among residents and insufficient job readiness were particularly pronounced."
28,The program offers both immediate employment opportunities and the potential for additional credentials necessary to advance to other jobs along the occupational ladder.
29,"The training focuses on the skills necessary for local job demands in fields such as health care, education, and information technology."
30,"More recently, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis conducted a study of the effectiveness of community colleges in advancing the economic well-being of students and found that students who attend a community college gain economic advantages in the job market, even without completing a degree."
31,"The majority of these gains were from math, science, and other technically oriented courses.7 In addition to the need to bridge a substantial skills gap in many job markets, the challenge of connecting the residents of poor neighborhoods to jobs often entails overcoming informational and transportation barriers."
32,"As a follow up to the case study, the Boston Bank recommended expanded training, internship, mentorship, outreach, and other programs designed to develop Springfield's human capital and job market connections."
33,"Moreover, many of the jobs in growth sectors, such as health care and technology, tend to have varying shifts, which makes using public transportation difficult."
34,"As you can see, the Federal Reserve is not only working to improve the national economic outlook, but it is also engaged in some very local initiatives designed to identify and address barriers to employment for those most impacted by recent job losses."
