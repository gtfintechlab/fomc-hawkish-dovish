0,"My plan is to address some topical and important issues, some of which are quite technical but technicalities that I think can have significant consequences.1 After providing my thoughts on where the economy and monetary policy are now, I will turn to what we can expect from monetary policy in the years to come."
1,"Changes in the economic environment since the financial crisis, including an apparent decline in the equilibrium interest rate, have complicated the conduct of monetary policy as we work to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is currently undertaking a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices to make sure we are best positioned to confront the challenges ahead."
3,"Instead, I would like to address a separate but not unrelated topic, the interaction of bank supervision and regulation with monetary policy, and how supervision and regulation might work to make monetary policy implementation more effective in the current environment, particularly as it relates to a bank's demand for reserves.2 But first, let me start with a brief take on the current economic outlook."
4,The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.
5,"Taken together, low unemployment and steady participation have boosted the employment-to-population ratio, which has finally surpassed its pre-crisis level."
6,"A strong labor market, in turn, supports a healthy pace of consumption growth and the economy more generally."
7,"Increasing the capital stock and investing in new technologies are important for productivity growth, rising living standards, and the economy's long-run growth rate, so reversing the recent downward trend is essential for the overall health of the economy."
8,"In part, the fall in investment likely reflects business concerns over the pace of global growth and risks to the outlook."
9,"In particular, 2019 was a bad year for economic growth among U.S. trading partners, and, as a consequence, our exports suffered."
10,"In summary, I remain optimistic about the outlook, but I am also highly aware that some notable risks still threaten growth, both overseas and at home."
11,A few words on inflation.
12,"Both headline and core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, came in at 1.6 percent in December, somewhat below the FOMC's 2 percent objective."
13,"This deviation does not worry me that much, in part because I expect inflation to move back to target over the medium term, in part as some unusually low readings in early 2019 pass out of the data."
14,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent."
15,Monetary Policy Considerations I view the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate given the economic outlook and relatively muted inflation pressures.
16,"Policy is in a good place to support continued economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to target."
17,"That said, now is a good time to be thinking about the challenges that monetary policy is likely to face in the coming years."
18,"One important development, as I mentioned at the start, is that interest rates at home and abroad have declined significantly from their pre-recession levels."
19,"Policymakers, economists, and market participants see much of this decline as reflecting a permanent fall in the equilibrium rate of interestâ€”that is, the level of the federal funds rate that keeps the economy at full employment with stable inflation in the longer run."
20,"One such tool is forward guidance: By credibly conveying to the public that policymakers will likely pursue a path for the policy rate that is lower than previously anticipated, policymakers can put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates."
21,The increased scarcity tends to raise the price of these securities and depress their yields.
22,"Some observers argue that forward guidance and asset purchases fully offset the shortfall in policy accommodation caused by a lack of space to cut interest rates further, so that the limits on the Fed's policy rate did not ultimately constrain our policy response to the financial crisis."
23,"In particular, inflation remained contained, and longer-run inflation expectations did not become unanchored."
24,"To gain the full benefit of our toolkit, it will be important to continue to communicate clearly about our willingness to use all of our tools in future downturns.6 The greater the public confidence that policymakers will use these tools in response to episodes when the ability to cut the policy rate is constrained, the more real longer-term interest rates will systematically decline in response to negative economic developments, providing an automatic stabilizer to the economy."
25,"Moreover, public confidence in the FOMC's ability to react to economic downturnsâ€”even when the policy rate is very lowâ€”will support the resilience of longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with the FOMC's objective."
26,Keeping inflation expectations anchored will in turn further support the FOMC's ability to lower real interest rates if the economy were to weaken substantially.
27,"Balance Sheet Policies and Reserve Demand Taking stock, I note that one approach to the constraints on policy imposed by the current low level of interest rates is to make what were previously unconventional toolsâ€”balance sheet policies and forward guidanceâ€”as conventional as possible."
28,"As the FOMC announced in January of 2019, the Committee intends to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.7 With that approach, control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and is not, over the longer term, reliant on frequent and large open market operations."
29,The Committee also reiterated that it would assess the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.
30,"I will spend the remainder of my time exploring possible means to enhance the efficiency of our monetary policy implementation, including reserve provision, through adjustments to our existing regulatory and supervisory regime."
31,"In particular, I will focus on liquidity regulation and supervision as well as interactions with monetary policy tools."
32,"Such an approach could improve the efficiency of monetary policy implementation, as firms might show a greater willingness to reallocate to Treasury securities, reducing reserve demand and improving market functioning."
