0,"Cloud, Minnesota February 21, 2003 Balance Sheets and the Recovery Economic growth and prosperity are created primarily by what economists call ""real"" factors--the productivity of the workforce, the quantity and quality of the capital stock, the availability of land and natural resources, the state of technical knowledge, and the creativity and skills of entrepreneurs and managers."
1,"Just as a strong financial system promotes growth, adverse financial conditions--for example, a weak banking system grappling with nonperforming loans and insufficient capital, or firms and households whose creditworthiness has eroded because of high leverage, poor income prospects, and assets of declining value--may prevent an economy from realizing its potential."
2,"A striking contemporary case is that of Japan, where the financial problems of banks and corporations have contributed substantially to a decade of subpar growth."
3,Or will financial problems in one or more sectors restrain spending and economic growth?
4,"However, as I will discuss, many firms have taken advantage of low interest rates to restructure their balance sheets and most seem financially capable of undertaking new capital investment and of ramping up hiring."
5,"The first factor is real (that is, inflation-adjusted) after-tax income, also called real disposable income, and the second is real wealth."
6,A principal reason for the consumer's resilience during the past two years has been continued healthy growth in real disposable income.
7,"Expectations for future increases in real disposable income also appear to be relatively optimistic, perhaps reflecting the recent strong performance of labor productivity."
8,"For example, the most recent Blue Chip consensus forecast is for real disposable income to grow 3.1 percent in 2003 and 3.5 percent in 2004 and to average growth of 3.2 percent per year over the 2004-13 period."
9,"For comparison, the average growth in real disposable income between 1993 and 2000 was 3.4 percent."
10,"In short, there is a reasonable chance that, in terms of real income growth, the next decade should be as good for households as the nineties were."
11,"Although in dollar terms, stockholdings remain concentrated in the upper income brackets, the pain of falling stock prices during the past three years has been widely shared: More than half of all U.S. households now own at least some equities, either directly or indirectly through such vehicles as mutual funds, pension plans, variable annuities, and personal trusts (Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore, 2003)."
12,"These rises in house prices have led some to worry about the possibility of a ""bubble"" in housing prices and the associated risks of further losses in household wealth, should this putative bubble pop."
13,"In particular, for the nation as a whole, the rise in house prices appears to have closely tracked economic fundamentals--including rising household incomes, high rates of household formation, and historically low mortgage interest rates."
14,"Experience suggests that house prices across SMSAs are rather imperfectly correlated and that price reversals, when they occur, are typically localized."
15,"Moreover, the ratio of the value of mortgage loans outstanding to home values in the aggregate has been roughly constant over the past few years, and most homeowners have substantial equity in their homes; thus even if moderate declines in house prices were to occur, they would not impose financial hardship on the great majority of households."
16,"Returning to the main thread of the discussion, I now address two related questions: First, how has the overall decline in wealth associated with the fall in stock prices affected consumer spending thus far, and second, how is it likely to affect spending in the next year or so?"
17,"Fed staff estimates are that wealth effects held back the growth in consumption spending by about 1-1/2 percentage points last year, relative to what it would have been otherwise."
18,"In short, the largest part of the negative wealth effect created by the fall in stock prices is probably behind us."
19,"For example, the ratio of debt service to disposable income peaked at 14.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001, although it fell somewhat in 2002 as disposable income rose and interest rates declined."
20,"In this regard, two items are worth stressing: first, the composition of the recent surge in consumer debt and, second, the role of the recent growth of the subprime credit market."
21,"Indeed, in 2002 new mortgage debt accounted for close to 90 percent of the overall growth in household debt."
22,This recent growth in mortgage debt continues a marked trend.
23,"Finally, most recently, mortgage debt has been powerfully boosted by the low mortgage interest rates available in the past couple of years."
24,"These low rates have stimulated record amounts of new home construction, which has not only permitted a growing number of Americans the opportunity for home ownership but has played a vital role in maintaining aggregate demand throughout the recession and recovery--not only in the construction industry but in ancillary industries such as home furnishings."
25,"Fairly generous assumptions about the propensity of households to devote equity cash-outs to new spending suggest that refinancings may have boosted annualized real consumption growth between ¼ and ½ percentage point in the second half of 2002, the period of maximum impact."
26,"A fairly substantial gap still remains between the current level of mortgage interest rates and the average level of interest on the outstanding stock of mortgages, suggesting that refinancings should continue at a brisk pace in the early part of this year."
27,"As refinancings slow later this year, however, they will create a slight drag on consumption growth relative to 2002."
28,"Not unexpectedly, however, lenders, borrowers, and regulators have faced a significant learning curve as this market has developed, and perhaps we should not be surprised that some of the loans made in this market in a period of strong economic growth have become distressed in a period of recession and rising unemployment."
29,"Probably the main risk to this forecast is not the state of household balance sheets but the state of the labor market, as a significant increase in unemployment might lead consumers to retrench."
30,"True, firms have distinguished themselves in at least one way: The increases in productivity we have seen in the nonfarm business sector over the past two years have been truly remarkable, particularly in light of the fact that productivity growth is typically weak during cyclical declines."
31,"For some time now, the business sector has been meeting a growing final demand without adding capital or employees."
32,"Presumably, businesses cannot indefinitely squeeze increasing productivity out of fixed resources and eventually will need to invest and add workers to meet the demand for their output."
33,Inventories are also currently lean and will likely need replenishment if final demand grows as forecast.
34,"The cost of capital remains low for most firms, reflecting the attractive long-term interest rates for borrowers with good prospects and the tax benefits to investing in equipment created by the partial expensing provision."
35,Ongoing technological changes imply that adding the newest generation of equipment should make possible still greater gains in productivity.
36,"By some estimates, because of asset-price declines, the defined-benefit pension plans of U.S. firms swung from being about $250 billion overfunded to being $200 billion to $250 billion underfunded between 2000 and 2002, necessitating large contributions to these plans that must be charged against operating profits.5 As these losses on pension fund assets are by convention amortized over time, firms' pension contributions will depress reported profits at least for the next couple of years (and, incidentally, raise reported compensation to workers)."
37,"Besides weak profits and the large decline in stock prices, the other obvious negative for the corporate sector is the evident deterioration in aggregate credit quality."
38,"Though less evident than the headline statistics about earnings and stock prices, there is also a positive financial story to tell about corporate America over the past couple of years."
39,"The ratio of interest expenses to outstanding debt for nonfinancial firms indicates that the average interest rate has fallen about 1-1/4 percentage points from its recent high at year-end 2000, to under 6 percent on average."
40,"With lower interest rates and higher profits, the average ratio of firms' interest expense to cash flow improved considerably in 2002, to about 18 percent (compared with a peak of 27 percent in 1991)."
41,"Historically, there have been numerous occasions in which financial problems in the banking system have slowed economic growth, such as in the already-mentioned case of Japan."
42,"To a remarkable degree, the profitability and liquidity of the 1990s has been maintained through the past two years of economic weakness.6 Some of the factors supporting profitability in the banking sector since 2000 include large inflows of cheap core deposits (as households have retreated from riskier investments), booming business in mortgage originations and refinancings, strong demand for credit cards, and capital gains on securities holdings."
43,"The Fed's Senior Loan Officer Survey has found very little tendency toward tightening of loan standards for consumers, either in regard to residential mortgages or other types of consumer loans; and, as I have already discussed, the demand for mortgage loans and home equity loans has been exceptionally strong."
44,"In part, reduced business lending may reflect some tightening of lending standards, particularly by larger banks and for riskier borrowers.7 Probably the more important factor depressing commercial and industrial lending, however, is the weak demand for business credit."
45,Other firms have taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to substitute long-term financing for bank loans and other short-term liabilities.
46,Reduced merger and acquisition activity has also reduced business demand for bank loans.
47,"As for the rest of this year and next year, the banking system seems well positioned to continue to support household spending and to accommodate increased credit demands by financially sound business borrowers."
48,"Equity prices have fallen significantly in the past three years, profits have made only a hesitant recovery, and aggregate indicators of financial stress remain at elevated levels."
