0,"On that premise, I always start my thinking about monetary policy by identifying what I like to call the outlook context."
1,"Is inflation likely to be stable, or will it rise or fall?"
2,Here I will address three questions: Has monetary policy been less effective recently compared with earlier periods of aggressive easing to counter sharply slower growth or the onset of recession?
3,"Let me remind you, before I proceed further, that my remarks today reflect my own views of the outlook and challenges facing monetary policy."
4,"Challenges Facing the Fed Immediately after the Events of September 11 Before I turn to the outlook and the challenges faced by monetary policymakers, I want to discuss the Federal Reserve's reaction to the disruption of financial transactions and the increased demand for liquidity and bank lending that resulted from the events of September 11."
5,"Second, we used monetary policy to counter what was sure to be a sharp adverse shock to demand and to bolster confidence that the Fed would do what was necessary to support the economy."
6,Assessing the condition of the economy and the appropriate course for monetary policy have remained central concerns at the Fed.
7,"Forecasters today often begin by almost apologizing for even offering a point forecast of economic activity over the coming year, given the prevailing uncertainties."
8,"Second, the strength of the rebound will ultimately depend importantly on the pace of underlying productivity growth and hence the average rate of growth possible once the economy reaches full employment."
9,"Though I viewed economic growth as perhaps bottoming out after slowing to a near-zero rate in the second and third quarters, I expected growth to build only slowly and therefore expected the pace of recovery through the first half of 2002 to be disappointing."
10,"Many interpreted this experience as suggesting that old rules no longer applied and, as a result, discounted long-standing regularities between resource utilization rates and inflation and worried less about limits to sustainable growth."
11,"To be sure, higher productivity growth was likely for a considerable period."
12,But the initial adjustment to the acceleration in productivity also brought temporary bonuses that were not likely to persist over the longer run.
13,"They took the form of a temporary spurt in demand growth--pushing the unemployment rate progressively lower--and a temporary disinflationary impetus, preventing the increased utilization rates from immediately raising inflation."
14,The persistent above-trend growth and progressive increase in utilization rates suggested to me a danger of overheating and higher inflation.
15,This concern encouraged a series of tightening moves in an attempt to slow economic growth at least toward the new higher trend and thereby prevent still higher utilization rates.
16,"In my view, a period of below-trend growth was likely to be required to unwind what I viewed as an unsustainably high rate of resource utilization."
17,"Besides the effect of monetary policy, a sizable rise in energy prices over 1999 and 2000 and into early 2001 contributed to an erosion of aggregate demand."
18,"It resulted in a sharp correction in equity prices in the technology sector--the bursting of the technology bubble--and, at the same time, it led to a sharp retrenchment in the demand for and production of high-tech equipment."
19,"The pre-September 11 prospects for recovery reflected the cumulative easing by the Fed, a sizable fiscal stimulus already in train, declining energy prices, and the normal internal dynamics that contribute to recoveries."
20,Long-term growth prospects.
21,The strength of the rebound expected before September 11 also was being shaped by the underlying pace of productivity growth.
22,"Recent revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts and other data, as well as the sharpness of the retrenchment in high-tech investment, had forced a reassessment of the prospects for longer-term productivity growth."
23,"In particular, the revisions had lowered the rate of productivity growth from 1998 through 2000 and, as a result, trimmed most estimates of the sustainable rate of economic growth going forward."
24,"Before the annual NIPA revisions earlier this year, many had revised their forecasts of underlying productivity growth progressively upward to near 3 percent or even slightly higher, compared with the 1-1/2 percent rate achieved during the twenty-five years before the mid-1990s."
25,The revisions suggested that underlying or structural productivity growth peaked at closer to 2-1/2 percent--still a remarkable improvement over the pre-1995 average but not quite as spectacular as many had thought.
26,"In addition, some of the earlier productivity growth, reflecting the frenzied pace of investment in high-tech equipment, now appears to have been unsustainable.1 Consensus estimates of longer-term productivity growth were revised downward to a range of 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent."
27,"The second is the remainder of a typical monetary policy forecast period, in this case through 2003."
28,"Auto sales soared to record levels in October, prompted, to be sure, by zero-interest rate financing."
29,"This description refers to the pattern of an outright decline in output for a couple of quarters, followed by a quick move to above-trend growth."
30,"The forces of recovery include an unusually aggressive macroeconomic policy response, including this year's easing of monetary policy to date and the stimulus associated with a series of fiscal policy actions--including those already implemented and those still under consideration."
31,Together these factors suggest the potential of a return to more solid rates of growth next year.
32,The possible effects of September 11 on productivity growth are the major issues over the longer term.
33,Three sets of forces could lower longer-term productivity growth.
34,"Many productivity shocks, in my view, are probably more to the level of productivity than to the growth rate of productivity."
35,"Of course, if the adjustment to the level occurs over a protracted period, it may feel like a shock to the growth of productivity."
36,"With a technological innovation, for example, the higher level of productivity is likely to emerge only gradually, as the innovation is disseminated through the economy."
37,"In any case, such innovations are likely to result in higher growth over a number of years."
38,The effects of higher business costs associated with security are (we can hope) a one-time decline in the level of productivity.
39,"The result in this case is, therefore, a transitory effect on the growth rate of potential output for a year or two, followed by a return to the rate of productivity growth that would have prevailed in the absence of the higher costs for security."
40,The second set of forces that could lower long-term productivity growth relates to the federal budget.
41,"To the extent that they are, national saving will be lower, real interest rates will be higher, and private capital formation will be lower."
42,"As a consequence, the level of productivity will be lower than otherwise, with the growth effect spread over a considerable period."
43,"Given the link between national saving and productivity and the dimension of the expected effect, I expect that the resulting decline in productivity through the crowding-out effect would be small, perhaps not more than 1/10 percentage point a year for a while."
44,"These developments, on balance, would take a toll on longer-term productivity growth."
45,"Nevertheless, in my view, they are not large enough to alter the conclusion that the pace of innovation in information technology and other industries has raised underlying productivity growth to a rate faster than prevailed in the twenty-five years prior to the mid-1990s."
46,"Still, the productivity story is exceptionally complex."
47,"On the one hand, we can take some comfort that underlying productivity growth should continue at a pace above that achieved from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s."
48,"On the other hand, the economy is suffering the consequences of a more recent decline in underlying productivity growth--a decline from the higher rate of underlying productivity growth enjoyed in the late 1990s and into early 2000."
49,Challenges Facing Monetary Policy Monetary and fiscal policymakers face many challenges under the circumstances.
50,I will focus on the challenges facing monetary policymakers.
51,One of these is calibrating monetary policy appropriately in light of fiscal policy.
52,Is Monetary Policy Less Effective than Previously?
53,"Monetary policy before September 11 had eased by 300 basis points, the most aggressive easing over a comparable period in almost twenty years."
54,"As a result, a question often asked today--indeed, almost always asked when the economy is in the midst of a recession or pronounced slowdown--is whether monetary policy is less effective today than it used to be."
55,One explanation is the normal lags in response of spending to monetary policy actions.
56,"But other factors, too, have contributed to the perception that monetary policy is less effective."
57,"These include the fact that the shocks weighing on the economy have been larger in magnitude and spread out in time and, partly as a result, forecasters in general have been continually revising down their forecasts of economic activity."
58,"Many have been surprised, in particular, by the sharpness and persistence of the retrenchment in high-tech investment and by the degree to which economic activity abroad slowed along with that in the United States."
59,Perhaps the most important consideration has been the evolution in overall financial conditions as monetary policy has eased.
60,Monetary policy does not work through the effect of a decline of the federal funds rate itself on spending.
61,"Monetary policy works through the so-called transmission mechanism, through channels that include short-term private interest rates, longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate."
62,"The effects on other rates and asset prices depend on the changes in the target funds rate relative to expectations already embedded in the financial markets and on changes in those expectations as a result of policy actions, statements accompanying those actions, and other developments."
63,"Other things being equal, a decline in the funds rate will lower short- and long-term private interest rates, raise equity prices, and depreciate the dollar."
64,"Of course, monetary policy presumably wouldn't have eased so much if the dollar had depreciated or the stock market had risen."
65,"At any rate, there has been painfully little pass-through from the funds rate to the operative channels, other than declines in private short-term interest rates."
66,The absence of pass-through does not reflect a change in the fundamental effectiveness of monetary policy so much as the offsetting effect of other financial shocks that were occurring at the same time the Fed was easing.
67,"The response of overall financial conditions to monetary policy easing in this episode has been unusual, if not unique."
68,"In previous recession periods, financial conditions have generally improved as the Fed has eased, reflecting the pass-through to lower short- and long-term private rates, higher equity prices, and a lower exchange rate."
69,"The major reason for the failure of financial conditions to improve in this case is that one of the major shocks--the reassessment of the profitability of owning and producing high-tech equipment--was, at the same time, a shock to financial markets and to aggregate demand."
70,So two of the key channels in the transmission of monetary policy behaved differently than expected.
71,Whether or not long-term interest rates have fallen as much as would have been expected from historical regularities is more difficult to assess.
72,The fiscal policy effects appear to be contributing to expectations of a robust recovery and a relatively quick and aggressive reversal of monetary policy.
73,"I would not conclude, however, that monetary policy is in general less effective because of structural changes that may have occurred."
74,But I do believe that the financial shocks that have occurred--including the shocks to equity prices and the dollar--have required monetary policy to move more aggressively than otherwise would have been the case.
75,"Given the initial low level of the nominal federal funds rate, we face the risk that, in what is arguably a worst-case scenario, that rate could be driven to zero, the practical limit for a nominal interest rate."
76,"In my view, the appropriate policy response, when confronted with such a potential limit, is to respond especially aggressively to any adverse demand shock, in effect, substituting speed of the move for the cumulative size of the easing."
77,"The danger in waiting is that inflation might drift lower, limiting the ability to drive the real federal funds rate into negative territory, as might be necessary to support a timely recovery."
78,"In the worst case, as in Japan today, inflation might turn to deflation, limiting the ability to lower the real policy rate even to zero."
79,The implication of starting with an unusually low interest rate is therefore not to go slowly but to more aggressively respond to any adverse shock.
80,"Fiscal policy became less focused on short-run stabilization and more focused on longer-run considerations, such as promoting growth through reductions in marginal tax rates (the Reagan approach) or through reductions in structural budget deficits (the Clinton approach)."
81,"It is widely believed that monetary policy has no effect on long-term growth rates for real GDP, aside from the benefits arising from achieving and maintaining price stability."
82,"In particular, beginning from a position of price stability, more accommodative monetary policy cannot raise the economy's long-term rate of growth."
83,"Monetary policy, on the other hand, is often viewed as having a comparative advantage in short-run stabilization."
84,"That advantage is based on the ability of monetary policymakers to change policy in a flash, compared with the difficult and often contentious process of legislating changes in taxes or spending, which are subject always to the threat of a presidential veto."
85,The inside lag is unquestionably shorter for monetary policy.
86,But Friedman also noted an outside lag--the lag from the policy response to its effect on aggregate demand and spending.
87,"Here the lag for monetary policy is probably longer than for some fiscal policy actions--for example, for spending that can be implemented quickly, like extensions of unemployment insurance, and for some tax changes, including tax rebates or surcharges, changes in withholding rates, and some temporary investment incentives, depending on the specific design."
88,"Indeed, Friedman argued that the long and variable lags for monetary policy, due to outside lags, made monetary policy an unlikely instrument for short-run stabilization."
89,"Of course, some fiscal policy actions have very gradual effects as well--perhaps as gradual as those from monetary policy actions."
90,Monetary and fiscal stimulus can complement each other when shocks are large and adverse and when interest rates are already low.
91,"But when the need is for temporary demand-side stimulus, they differ even more."
92,"The first principle in the design of a temporary demand stimulus is, virtually by definition, to avoid permanent changes that were not appropriate before the need for the demand stimulus."
93,"Permanent changes mean effects on out-year budgets--in this case lower surpluses, hence lower national saving, higher real interest rates, lower private investment and lower growth in productivity and output."
94,Bond markets have become very aggressive in building in expectations of rising short-term rates over time into today's long-term interest rates.
95,"The second principle for a temporary demand-side fiscal program is to implement policies that have a large ""bang for the buck."""
96,"Even with agreement on these two principles, designing a temporary demand-stimulus package is a challenge."
97,"Still, on balance, a package of well-crafted, temporary, quick-acting demand-side fiscal measures would, in my view, make a constructive contribution to supporting and strengthening the rebound expected next year."
98,The current debate in the Congress about fiscal stimulus creates a challenge for forecasters and monetary policymakers alike.
99,"Monetary policymakers condition their policy on a forecast, and the forecast must include some assumption about fiscal policy."
100,"In most cases, and especially when fiscal policy was not a player in stabilization policy, this dependence of monetary policy on fiscal policy was not a serious issue."
101,"Fortunately, a considerable amount of stimulus is already in train because of the combination of monetary policy easing and fiscal policy measures already enacted."
102,"For the moment, the risks continue to be to the down side, but the front-loaded response of monetary policy has already made an important contribution to countering the further adverse shock and, in addition, has provided some insurance against downside risks."
103,"Once the economy shows signs of moving to a rate of growth above trend, the Fed will have to reassess the appropriate degree of stimulus and, at some point, begin the return to a more neutral policy."
104,"Footnotes 1.Many forecasters during this period began to measure underlying or ""structural"" productivity growth in terms of the path of its components: multi-factor productivity growth and the contribution to productivity growth from capital deepening."
105,"Multi-factor productivity is the increase in productivity that is not directly related to the growth of non-labor physical inputs, specifically capital."
106,Capital deepening is the increase in productivity as a result of the increase in the amount of capital relative to labor.
107,The multi-factor productivity component is adjusted to remove cyclical influences.
