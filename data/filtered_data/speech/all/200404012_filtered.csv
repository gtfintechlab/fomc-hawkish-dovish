0,"This prompt and aggressive action undoubtedly served to limit the decline in economic activity, and, in fact, the recent recession was one of the mildest on record."
1,"The Federal Reserve recognizes that the federal funds rate is currently lower than it can be on a sustainable basis: At some point, as the economy moves back toward higher levels of employment, policy accommodation will no longer be needed and the funds rate will be raised."
2,"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets."
3,"At the same time, inflation has been quite low and shows few signs that it is in the process of picking up."
4,"In a few cases, the reasoning appears to be that we are risking a major increase in inflation by waiting."
5,"In particular, these critics worry that a continued environment of low interest rates is giving rise to economic imbalances--excessive indebtedness, and elevated prices of houses, equities, and bonds--that in the longer run will come back to haunt us."
6,"They fear that the return to more-normal levels of short-term interest rates might eventually be accompanied by an especially sharp upswing in bond and mortgage rates, a softening in the prices of houses and equities, and problems for households in meeting higher debt obligations that, in turn, could result in a substantial weakening in spending."
7,Those worried about these possibilities say that the Federal Reserve should begin to remove its policy accommodation promptly to limit any further buildup of debt and distortions of asset prices.
8,"The Effects of Low Interest Rates As I have already discussed, the current level of the federal funds rate came about in response to a weakening economy in 2001 and a recovery that has been characterized by the persistence of considerable slack in labor markets and low and declining inflation."
9,Stimulative monetary policy helps the economy recover from a spell of economic weakness largely through its effects on interest rates and asset prices.
10,Long-term interest rates--the ones most relevant to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and firms--have been held down by easy monetary policy and the expectation that short-term rates will remain low for some time.
11,And these low rates in turn have boosted the prices of houses and the value of corporate equity.
12,"Under the influence of increased wealth and low borrowing costs, households have bought more and larger houses and cars, have taken on more debt, and generally have spent more than would have been the case if interest rates had been higher."
13,"Nothing is necessarily wrong with these developments; in fact, they are by-and-large the intended and logical consequences of the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce economic slack through low interest rates."
14,"To be sure, when short-term interest rates rise, bond yields will also rise, the amount of income needed to service debt will increase, and the prices of houses and equity will begin to reflect the greater competition for savers' dollars."
15,"But as long as interest rates and asset prices are reasonably well aligned with the forces likely to affect the economy, and as long as the public has reasonably accurate expectations about the size and timing of the eventual increase in interest rates and its effect on wealth and debt service, then the economy should not experience any particularly severe bumps when these developments unfold."
16,"Of course, expectations cannot be entirely accurate; the path interest rates will follow depends on future economic developments, many of which inevitably will be surprises, and in response markets will need to adjust, perhaps substantially."
17,"Moreover, some households and firms probably harbor unrealistic expectations about the future based on extrapolations of recent interest rates or trends in asset prices, and they run the risk of experiencing serious difficulties as a result."
18,"But as long as myopia appeared to be restricted to a relatively small portion of the population, and asset prices and expectations in the aggregate seemed realistic given what we know today, we would have little reason to anticipate serious problems as interest rates adjust."
19,"However, if imbalances were thought to exist--if expectations appeared unrealistic and asset prices distorted--then we would judge that the potential for a sharp correction in financial markets and associated economic instability was greater."
20,Let me begin with the question of whether interest rates and asset prices have been pushed away from appropriate levels.
21,"They also worry about the effects of a related behavior in which financial intermediaries borrow at low short-term rates to lend at higher long-term rates--the so-called ""carry trade""--and about the effects of low interest rates on the prices of houses."
22,"Indeed, behaviors of this sort transmit accommodative monetary policy through financial markets to accomplish its intended effect of stimulating demand."
23,"Forming such a judgment requires a view on the level of asset prices that would be ""appropriate"" given economic fundamentals."
24,"An important observation, however, is that the yield curve is currently quite steep, implying that market participants have priced in a substantial rise in short-term rates."
25,"This expected rate is not unusually low by historical standards; it is near or even above the expectations during the low-inflation period of the 1950s and early 1960s, and it is well within the range of expectations since the mid-1990s."
26,"However, this pattern in part reflects the Federal Reserve's statements about policy patience and the fact that the economic expansion so far has made only limited progress in reducing slack, particularly in the labor market, even at very low interest rates."
27,"Warnings about a possible ""bubble"" in house prices have been sounded for a number of years now."
28,"About a year ago, I examined this issue in some detail and concluded that, while one could never be very confident about such a judgment, house prices were not obviously too high and the housing stock was not clearly too large.1 Since then, however, prices have climbed further, and by more than the rise in rents--a proxy for the return on houses."
29,"Consequently, the odds have risen that these prices could be out of line with fundamentals."
30,"Moreover, some factors, including increasing prosperity and wealth associated in part with rapid gains in labor productivity and earning power, should help support house prices in the future and thereby reduce the risk of a sizable correction in which prices actually fall across a large number of localities."
31,"But the vast majority of households are not encountering problems meeting obligations, and they have protected themselves to a considerable extent against increasing interest rates by borrowing for longer terms at fixed rates."
32,"As a consequence, debt servicing obligations will rise very gradually even if market interest rates increase rapidly."
33,"Moreover, any increase in rates would most probably occur in circumstances in which income and employment were also rising briskly, and thus adding to the resources available to consumers."
34,"Barring a collapse in house or equity prices when interest rates rise, household net worth should remain comfortably above the levels of a few years ago."
35,"To be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations of a benign economic environment--one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy will continue to strengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities will remain solid."
36,"In the absence of any substantial distortions in asset prices and debt levels, households and businesses, on average, have not likely been engaging in misguided decisions that they, or the central bank, will come to regret."
37,"Some borrowers and lenders will be caught by surprise when rates rise and will suffer losses; houses could be overvalued in some markets and subject to correction; and even small, largely predictable changes in interest rates and asset prices could interact in unexpected ways."
38,"And asset prices and interest rates that look roughly in line with fundamentals today, may not be tomorrow."
39,"Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a correction."
40,Corrections in interest rates and asset values may have the most potential for disruption when they impair the financial health of borrowers and lenders and thereby cause them to pull back even further than might be warranted by the change in rates or prices.
41,"I am encouraged by the way our financial system came through the very difficult circumstances of the last few years, including the plunge in equity values, the recession, the subsequent period of slow growth, and the spike in credit problems."
42,"If investors sense that asset-price adjustments are undermining the expansion, interest rates will fall back because investors will anticipate a lower trajectory for the federal funds rate."
43,"For its part, the Federal Reserve will adapt its monetary policy to unexpected developments in an effort to keep the economy on track toward high employment and stable prices."
44,Implications for the Current Policy Setting That brings me to what I see as the implications of this analysis for the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy of keeping the federal funds rate low and being patient in removing policy accommodation.
45,"I am not disputing the argument that current policy has contributed to higher asset prices, more household indebtedness, and strong activity in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing."
46,"The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not appear all that large, given the stance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher interest rates and softer asset prices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could absorb such a shock."
47,Should policymakers adjust policy today to slow the growth of debt and limit potential overshooting in bond and housing markets?
48,"Such a policy would clearly have near-term costs: It would slow the expansion in demand, damp the creation of new jobs, and keep inflation lower than it otherwise would be."
49,"Those costs could be significant, given that the economy is already operating with substantial slack and that any further decline in inflation would leave it at uncomfortably low levels."
50,"In my view, policymakers face a very high burden of proof when it comes to accepting fairly predictable short-term pain in the form of slower expansion in exchange for the possibility of gain over the longer run in the form of reduced risks of fluctuations in output, induced by sharp and unanticipated variations in interest rates and asset prices."
51,Households and those that lend to them also cannot count on large increases in house prices persisting.
52,"Rising rates are sure to cool the housing market, and possibly could cause prices to soften in some localities."
53,"Investors, too, must be aware that short-term interest rates, and hence the opportunity cost of their longer-term investments, will increase."
54,"Investors are unlikely to be able to exit from these bets before the market starts to adjust; it is highly probable that many folks in similar circumstances will be trying to squeeze through the same door at the same time, in which case prices could adjust sharply."
55,The second consideration is that regulators of financial institutions should strive to ensure that these institutions have risk-management systems in place that help to assess and control vulnerability to potential adjustments in interest rates and asset prices.
56,"Conclusion Interest rates are at unsustainable levels, and monetary policy will need to tighten eventually if the economy is to be kept on a path to high employment and price stability."
57,But the economies in which these central banks operate have been running at higher levels of resource utilization and have experienced faster increases in some asset prices than has the United States.
