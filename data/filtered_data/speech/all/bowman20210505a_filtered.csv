2,"May 05, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy Governor Michelle W. Bowman At The Colorado Forum, Denver, Colorado (via webcast) Share Thank you for this opportunity to address the members of the Colorado Forum, which has been an arena for thoughtful discussion and debate for more than 40 years."
3,"As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression."
4,We also cut short-term interest rates to near zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses.
5,"Calm was restored in financial markets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill."
6,"Rapid progress last summer gave way to slower economic growth over the turn of the year, as infection rates once again surged."
7,"Recently, the incoming data indicate that economic activity is on an upswing, and the risks of more negative outcomesâ€”especially those from COVID-19â€”appear to be easing."
8,"In the job market, job gains rebounded to 916,000 in March."
9,"Likewise, the FOMC median in March was for unemployment to fall to 4.5 percent at the end of 2021, and now it seems possible that it may fall even further."
10,I would be interested to hear from this group about how businesses in Colorado have been faring and whether they have seen an improvement in demand as the pandemic conditions are easing.
11,"Likewise, economic growth rebounded much more quickly than many had expected, but then slowed late in 2020 before regaining speed following the availability of the vaccine."
12,"The economic recovery is not yet complete, and the uncertain course of the pandemic still presents risks in the near term, which is why my colleagues and I on the FOMC decided last week to maintain our highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
13,"Despite the progress to date and the signs of acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is well below where it should be, considering the pre-pandemic trend."
14,"In particular, our maximum employment mandate is intended as a broad and inclusive goal increasing employment and opportunity, but I remain concerned that employment gains for some minority groups have lagged behind those of others."
15,"We are making good progress toward our full employment goal, but we still have a long way to go, and risks remain."
16,"Over the next several months, I expect that headline inflation measures will move above our long-run target of 2 percent."
17,A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes.
18,"But in addition, the unusually rapid rebound in economic activity that we've seen, along with the pandemic-driven shift towards goods purchases, has led to supply-chain bottlenecks in a number of areas, which in turn have pushed up prices for many goods."
19,One prominent example is with semiconductor producers and their need to dramatically alter the mix of production to meet demands of the high-tech and automotive industries.
20,"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain."
21,"If the supply bottlenecks prove to be more long-lasting than currently expected, I will adjust my views on the inflation outlook accordingly."
22,"At this point, the risk that inflation remains persistently above our long-run target of 2 percent still appears small."
