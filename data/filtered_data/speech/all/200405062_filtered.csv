0,"We in the UnitedStates have been incurring ever larger trade deficits, with the broader current account measure having reached 5 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP)."
1,"Meanwhile, we have lurched from a budget surplus in 2000 to a deficit that is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be 4-1/4 percent of GDP this year."
2,"In the process, lower prices for some goods and services produced by our trading partners have competitively suppressed domestic price pressures."
3,"The consequent significant additions to world production and trade have clearly put downward pressure on domestic prices, though somewhat less so over the past year."
4,"Moreover, the pronounced fall in inflation, virtually worldwide, over the past two decades has doubtless been a key factor in the notable decline in world economic volatility."
5,"In tandem with increasing globalization, monetary policy, to most observers, has become increasingly effective in achieving the objective of price stability."
6,"But because we have not experienced a sufficient number of economic turning points to judge the causal linkages among increased globalization, improved monetary policy, significant disinflation, and greater economic stability, the structure of the transitional paradigm is necessarily sketchy."
7,"With a deepening of specialization and a growing population free to take risks over a widening area, production has become increasingly international.1 The pronounced structural shift over the past decade to a far more vigorous competitive world economy than that which existed in earlier postwar decades apparently has been adding significant stimulus to world economic activity."
8,"Globalization was enhanced further when the inflation-ridden 1970s provoked a rethinking of the philosophy of economic policy, the roots of which were still planted in the Depression era."
9,"At the same time, there was a growing recognition that inflation impaired economic performance."
10,"Indeed, Group of Seven world leaders at their 1977 Economic Summit identified inflation as a cause of unemployment."
11,"Moreover, monetary policy tightening, and not increased regulation, came to be seen by the end of that decade as the only viable solution to taming inflation2."
12,The widening current account deficit in the United States has come to dominate the tail of that distribution of external balances across countries.
13,"Thus, the decline in home bias, or its equivalent, expanding globalization, has apparently enabled the United States to finance and, hence, incur so large a current account deficit."
14,A U.S. current account deficit of 5 percent or more of GDP would probably not have been readily fundable a half-century ago or perhaps even a couple of decades ago.4 The ability to move that much of world saving to the United States in response to relative rates of return almost surely would have been hindered by the far-lesser degree of both globalization and international financial flexibility that existed at the time.
15,Such large transfers would presumably have induced changes in the prices of assets that would have proved inhibiting.
16,"That shift, over time, would likely induce contractions in both the U.S. current account deficit and the corresponding current account surpluses of other nations."
17,Can market forces incrementally defuse a buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so?
18,"In a world economy that is sufficiently flexible, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates presumably would change to reestablish global balance.5 We may not be able to usefully determine at what point foreign accumulation of net claims on the United States will slow or even reverse, but it is evident that the greater the degree of international flexibility, the less the risk of a crisis.6 Should globalization continue unfettered and thereby create an ever more flexible international financial system, history suggests that current account imbalances will be defused with modest risk of disruption."
19,"* * * Augmenting the dramatic effect of increased globalization on economic growth, and perhaps at some times, fostering it, have been the remarkable technological advances of recent decades."
20,The long-term path of technology and growth is difficult to discern.
21,"Nonetheless, the overall pace of productivity growth that has recently been near 5 percent at an annual rate is highly likely to slow because we have rarely exceeded 3 percent for any protracted period."
22,"Thus, even though the longer-term prospects for innovation and respectable productivity growth are encouraging, some near-term slowing in the pace of advance to a rate closer to productivity's long-term average seems likely."
23,"With interest rates low, debt service costs for households are average, or only marginally higher than average."
24,"Even should interest rates rise materially further, the effect on household expenses will be stretched out because four-fifths of debt is fixed rate of varying maturities, and it will take time for debt to mature and reflect the higher rates."
25,"Despite the almost two percentage point rise in mortgage rates on new originations from mid-1999 to mid-2000, the average interest rate on outstanding mortgage debt rose only slightly, as did debt service."
26,"In a related concern, a number of analysts have conjectured that the extended period of low interest rates is spawning a bubble in housing prices in the United States that will, at some point, implode."
27,"To be sure, indexes of house prices based on repeat sales of existing homes have outstripped increases in rents, suggesting at least the possibility of price misalignment in some housing markets."
28,A softening in housing markets would likely be one of many adjustments that would occur in the wake of an increase in interest rates.
29,But a destabilizing contraction in nationwide house prices does not seem the most probable outcome.
30,"Indeed, nominal house prices in the aggregate have rarely fallen and certainly not by very much."
31,"Still, house prices, like those of many other assets, are difficult to predict, and movements in those prices can be of macroeconomic significance."
32,"Debt-to-equity ratios are well within historical ranges, and the recent prolonged period of low long-term interest rates has enabled corporations to fund short-term liabilities and stretch out bond maturities."
33,"The resolution of our current account deficit and household debt burdens does not strike me as overly worrisome, but that is certainly not the case for our yawning fiscal deficit."
34,"Our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances."
35,"One issue that concerns most analysts, especially in the context of a widening structural federal deficit, is inadequate national saving."
36,"Although saving is a necessary condition for financing the capital investment required to engender productivity, it is not a sufficient condition."
37,"The very high saving rates of the Soviet Union, of China, and of India in earlier decades, often did not foster significant productivity growth in those countries."
38,It is thus difficult to judge how significant a problem our relatively low gross domestic saving rate is to the future growth of an efficient capital stock.
39,The high productivity growth rate of the past decade does not suggest a problem.
