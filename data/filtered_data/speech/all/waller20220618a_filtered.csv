2,"June 18, 2022 Lessons Learned on Normalizing Monetary Policy Governor Christopher J. Waller At â€œMonetary Policy at a Crossroads,â€ a panel discussion hosted by the Dallas Society for Computational Economics, Dallas, Texas Share Watch Live Thank you, Meredith and Cullum and thank you to the Society for the invitation to speak to you today."
3,"This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took another significant step toward achieving our inflation objective by raising the Federal Funds rate target by 75 basis points."
4,"The Fed is ""all in"" on re-establishing price stability, and part of that effort involves understanding the forces that have boosted inflation and also examining how policymakers responded."
5,"Today, I intend to look back on monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, as I have before in recent speeches, but go a bit further and try to discern some lessons learned.1 In addition to the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs, the monetary policy actions taken during this time were deemed extraordinary."
6,"Structural changes in the economy have tended to lower interest rates and limit the room that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates during a slowdown.2 I hope we never have another two years like 2020 and 2021, but because of the low-interest-rate environment we now face, I believe that even in a typical recession there is a decent chance that we will be considering policy decisions in the future similar to those we made over the past two years."
7,"Besides supporting smooth market functioning, asset purchases also aided in the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
8,"Over the course of 2020, the Fed's liquidity and credit facilities saw reduced demand and most of the emergency programs were decommissioned around year end."
9,"Perhaps the most straightforward takeaway for monetary policy is that in times of severe stress, lending facilities, along with sharp cuts to the federal funds rate and the introduction of large-scale asset purchases, are very effective in reviving the economy."
10,"There are some other lessons, I think, from the experience of tightening monetary policy, a process which was put in motion by the guidance that the FOMC issued in 2020 about how long it would keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and continue asset purchases."
11,"In September and December of 2020, the FOMC provided criteria or conditions in the meeting statement that would need to be met before the FOMC would consider raising interest rates and begin to reduce asset purchases, respectively."
12,I mention this distinction because some have argued that the FOMC's new strategy was a factor that led the Committee to wait too long to begin tightening monetary policy.
13,"In early 2021, the Committee began noting whether the economy was making progress toward our employment and inflation goals, and thus getting closer to decisions on unwinding our highly accommodative policy."
14,"For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."
15,"""4 Meanwhile, the FOMC said that it would keep rates near zero until our employment goal had been reached and until inflation had reached 2 percent and was ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
16,"In November and December 2020, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent and inflation seemed to be in check: 12-month personal consumption expenditures inflation was declining, and core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was more or less steady at 1.5 percent."
17,The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023.
18,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.
19,"Then, later that month, data indicated inflation was accelerating, so the Committee hastened the pace of tapering at the December meeting, making a plan to wind down purchases by early March."
20,"Between December and March of this year inflation data came in very elevated, and at that point there was no question that inflation had been above 2 percent for ""some time."""
21,"Given continued improvement in the labor market and the high inflation readings, the Committee began raising interest rates in March, as soon as asset purchases were completed."
22,"However, if we had less restrictive tapering criteria and had started tapering sooner, the Committee could have had more flexibility on when to begin raising rates.6 So, by requiring substantial further progress toward maximum employment to even begin the process of tightening policy, one might argue that it locked the Committee into holding the policy rate at the zero lower bound longer than was optimal."
23,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.
24,"In closing, I hope that our country is not faced with another crisis as severe as the one precipitated by COVID, and that the Fed is not faced with the challenges of setting monetary policy under such conditions."
25,"See Christopher J. Waller (2022), ""Reflections on Monetary Policy in 2021,"" speech delivered at the 2022 Hoover Institution Monetary Conference, Stanford, California, May 6; and Christopher J. Waller (2021), ""A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor: Lessons from the Pandemic for Economic Forecasters,"" speech delivered at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York, December 17."
26,"Research has suggested a large number of developments may have contributed to a decline in the equilibrium real interest rate, focusing on factors that may have shifted aggregate savings and/or investment in a manner that depresses the real interest rate required to equilibrate savings and investment."
