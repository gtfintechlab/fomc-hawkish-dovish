2,"May 13, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Governor Christopher J. Waller At The Global Interdependence Center's 39th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, The LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, George and the Global Interdependence Center, for the invitation to speak to you this afternoon."
3,I am with you to talk about my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.1 In the last week we have received employment and inflation reports that have garnered a lot of attention.
4,"Let's remember, and this applies to latest inflation data too, that a month does not make a trendâ€”the trend for the economy is excellent."
5,"My second message is that, despite the unexpectedly high CPI inflation report yesterday, the factors putting upward pressure on inflation are temporary, and an accommodative monetary policy continues to have an important role to play in supporting the recovery."
6,The pandemic and resulting public health response led to the sharpest drop in employment and output the United States has likely ever experiencedâ€”22 million jobs lost in eight weeks and an annualized decline of 30 percent in real gross domestic output for the second quarter of 2020.
7,"But thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and aggressive fiscal and monetary policy, the economy is recovering much faster than anyone expected six months ago."
8,"The initial estimate of first quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth came in at a 6.4 percent annual rate, surpassing the level of output in the first quarter of 2020, before the full force of COVID-19 hit the economy."
9,"Second-quarter growth is likely to be as much as 8 percent, and the prospects are good that GDP will be close to trend output by the end of 2021."
10,Surveys of purchasing managers point to continued solid growth in both manufacturing and business services.
11,"Employment, as I said, is still below where it was in February 2020, by 8 million jobs."
12,"The unemployment rate is still 2.5 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020, and we know that it is even worse for some groupsâ€”nearly 10 percent for Black workers and nearly 8 percent for Hispanics."
13,The employment-to-population ratio continues to be depressed from February 2020.
14,"This chart, like the disappointing jobs report for April, shines a light on a current puzzle characterizing the U.S. labor marketâ€”a lot of job openings, but high unemployment rates and a low labor force participation rate."
15,"When the pandemic hit, both labor demand and labor supply fell dramatically."
16,The combination of widespread vaccines and fiscal and monetary stimulus caused consumer demand to recover sharply.
17,"This situation, in turn, caused labor demand to rebound quickly, particularly in goods-producing industries."
18,"However, due to factors like continued fears of the virus, the enhanced unemployment insurance, child-care issues, and early retirements, labor supply has not rebounded in the same fashion, which led to a situation with excess demand for labor and upward pressure on wages.4 And that is exactly what we saw in the April jobs report."
19,"Finally, the enhanced unemployment benefits passed in response to the pandemic expire in September, and research has shown repeatedly that the job-finding rate spikes as unemployment benefits run out.5 Thus, while labor demand is currently outrunning labor supply, supply should catch up soon."
20,"Now let me turn to the other leg of the Fed's dual mandate, price stability."
21,"It was a surprise, but a look at its causes doesn't alter my fundamental outlook, which is that the main pressures on inflation are temporary."
22,"First, let me address concerns that strong growth threatens to unleash an undesired escalation in inflation."
23,"In August 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a new policy framework that includes flexible average inflation targeting and a policy stance based on economic outcomes as opposed to economic forecasts."
24,Flexible average inflation targeting means we aim to have inflation overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal if inflation had been running persistently below target.
25,"Given that we missed our inflation target on the low side consistently for the past eight years or so, the FOMC has said that it will aim to moderately overshoot its inflation target for some period but then have it return to target."
26,Our willingness to aim for above-target inflation also means we will not overreact to temporary overshoots of inflationâ€”we need to see inflation overshoot our target for some time before we will react.
27,An outcomes-based policy stance means that we must see inflation before we adjust policyâ€”we will not adjust based on forecasts of unacceptably high inflation as we did in the past.
28,"Call this the ""Doubting Thomas"" approach to monetary policyâ€”we will believe it when we see it."
29,"We asked to see it, and lo and behold, we are now starting to see inflation exceeding our inflation target."
30,"Although inflation is starting to exceed our 2 percent target, in my view, this development is largely due to a set of transitory factors that are occurring all at once."
31,"First, there is what we economists call ""base effects,"" which is the simple arithmetic of what happens when the very low inflation readings of the first half of 2020 fall out of our 12-month measure of inflation."
32,"A second temporary factor is higher energy prices, which have rebounded this year as the economy strengthens but are expected to level off later this year."
33,"Retail gasoline prices have jumped in some areas due to the disruption of the Colonial Pipeline, but the effect on inflation should be temporary also."
34,"Stimulus checks put money in people's pockets, and when they spend it, there will be upward pressure on prices."
35,"But when the checks are gone, the upward pressure on prices will ease."
36,"As households draw down these savings, demand for goods and services will increase, which again will put upward pressure on prices."
37,"But, just like stimulus checks, once the excess savings is gone, it is gone, and any price pressures from this factor will ease."
38,"A fifth factor is supply bottlenecks that manufacturers and importers are currently experiencing; supply chain constraints are boosting prices, particularly for goodsâ€”less so for services."
39,"If demand and prices rise for a product, supply will follow, and bottlenecks will dissipate."
40,"So once again, price pressures induced by bottlenecks should reverse as supply chains catch up and orders get filled."
41,"Finally, the excess demand for labor I described earlier is likely to continue to push wages up in the next couple of months."
42,"How much of this increase gets passed through to prices is unknown, but some of it will."
43,I expect that all of these factors will cause inflation to overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2021.
44,"But they will not lead to sustained, high rates of inflation."
45,"Financial markets seem to think the sameâ€”5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates.6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long."
46,"While I fully expect the price pressure associated with these factors to ease and for some of the large increases in prices to reverse, it may take a while to do so."
47,"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away."
48,"For these reasons, I expect that inflation will exceed 2 percent this year and next year."
49,"And in my view, this fluctuation is okayâ€”our new framework is designed to tolerate a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2 percent."
50,"Before I turn to the implications of all this for monetary policy, a word about the housing market."
51,"As I said earlier, housing is a bright spot in the economy that is encouraging investment and lifting household wealth, which is all good, but with memories of recent history in mind, the fast growth in housing prices in most areas of the United States does bear close watching."
52,"Housing is becoming less affordable, and that price increase has the biggest effect on low-income individuals and families who have struggled the most since last spring and who are always the most vulnerable to rising rents and home prices."
53,"Prices for lumber and other inputs for housing are skyrocketing, and while that occurrence is not having a significant effect on inflation, it is limiting the supply of new homes and helping feed the house price boom."
54,Inflation is currently being driven above our 2 percent inflation target but is expected to return to target in subsequent years as transitory inflation shocks fade.
55,"Highly accommodative monetary policy, in conjunction with unprecedented fiscal support, has supported a rapid recovery from a uniquely sharp, pandemic-caused recession."
56,We also need to see if the unusually high price pressures we saw in the April CPI report will persist in the months ahead.
