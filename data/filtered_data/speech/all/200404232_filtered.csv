0,"I know that you have a keen interest in the likely future course of the economy and of monetary policy, so I will use my time today to comment on both topics."
1,"I will begin with the economic outlook, discussing prospects for economic growth, the labor market, and inflation, and conclude by drawing some implications for monetary policy."
2,"As always, my views are my responsibility alone and are not to be ascribed to my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.1 The Prospects for Economic Growth Broadly, the economy has shown substantially increased vitality since the middle of last year, and with the passage of time the economic recovery has shown increasing signs of becoming self-sustaining."
3,"Judging from the most recent data, growth in domestic spending appears consistent with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for the first quarter and at a rate of 4 percent or higher for 2004 as a whole."
4,"One reason for increased confidence that the recovery is becoming self-sustaining is that the expansion of aggregate demand has become more broad-based, with households, firms, and government all making contributions to spending growth."
5,"Household spending is likely to continue to grow at a solid pace for the remainder of this year, especially if the job market improves as expected."
6,"A question that many have asked is whether household spending, including spending on new homes, will remain strong if interest rates rise."
7,I think that consumers are not badly positioned for a normal cyclical increase in interest rates.
8,"Mortgage rates have risen in the past month but remain low relative to historical experience, while new household formation, improved job prospects, and income growth should ensure a continued healthy demand for housing."
9,"However, residential investment is unlikely to rise much further from current high levels and thus its contribution to GDP growth over the next year or two can be expected to decline."
10,Energy price increases have reduced households' real disposable personal income by about $30 billion since December.
11,"This development will probably shave a tenth or two from the growth in personal consumption expenditures in 2004 but thus far, at least, the rise in energy prices does not materially affect the outlook."
12,"Double-digit growth in real spending on equipment and software seems quite possible this year, in part because the expiration of partial expensing allowances at the end of 2004 will lead some firms to move forward investment they otherwise would have made in 2005."
13,"Given the very low inventory stocks currently held by businesses, inventory investment should also support growth."
14,The Federal government's budget deficit is expected to peak this year at something between $450 billion and $500 billion.
15,"Both increased government expenditures and reduced taxes will support growth in aggregate demand in 2004, though fiscal policy will provide somewhat less impetus and may even be slightly restrictive in 2005."
16,"On net, the external sector will probably continue to be a slight drag on U.S. growth, and little if any progress is likely to be made in closing the current account deficit this year."
17,"As has been widely noted, the leading explanation for the slow recovery in the labor market has been the remarkable ability of employers and workers to increase labor productivity."
18,"Output per hour probably grew at a rate exceeding 4 percent in the first quarter of this year, accounting for the lion's share of growth during the quarter."
19,"Although these productivity increases are unalloyed good news for the U.S. economy in the longer term, in the short run they have allowed firms to expand production rapidly while adding fewer workers than would be normal in a cyclical expansion."
20,"I and many others have argued that this situation cannot persist: As managers exhaust the possibilities for outsized productivity gains and become convinced of the durability of the expansion, they should become increasingly more willing to add employees (Bernanke, 2003b)."
21,"Unfortunately, the pace of productivity gains and hence of employment growth has proved difficult to forecast."
22,Recent employment gains have not been confined to a few industries.
23,"For example, in March the one-month employment diffusion index, which measures the proportion of industries with expanding employment relative to the share of industries with contracting employment, reached its highest value since July 2000."
24,Initial claims for unemployment insurance have also been falling and are now at pre-recession levels.
25,"Since June of last year, when the pace of output growth picked up significantly, employment as measured by the household survey (on a comparable payroll basis) has risen by 1.42 million jobs, more than double the increase of 689,000 jobs reported by the payroll survey."
26,"For example, although the unemployment rate (measured by the household survey) has fallen to 5.7 percent from its peak of 6.3 percent last June, that rate remains high relative to recent experience and in comparison to most plausible recent estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment."
27,"The evidence suggests, moreover, that the official unemployment rate of 5.7 percent understates to some extent the true amount of slack in the labor market."
28,"According to the household survey, the labor force participation rate has actually declined significantly since the official trough of the cycle, from 66.7 percent of the working-age population in November 2001 to 65.9 percent in March 2004.4 From its peak last June, the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage point, from 6.3 percent to 5.7 percent."
29,The net result is that the employment-to-population ratio has barely changed since the middle of last year.
30,"One way to see the extent of the slack in the labor market, as measured even by the household survey, is to ask how much job creation would be needed to bring the unemployment rate down further."
31,"Underlying the household survey's employment calculations is an estimate that the adult non-institutional population grew in March by 193,000 people."
32,"To keep the unemployment rate at 5.7 percent in April, then, household employment (as opposed to payroll employment) would have to grow by 120,000 jobs."
33,"To reduce the unemployment rate under these assumptions, of course, more than 120,000 net new jobs would be needed."
34,"If people perceive a significant improvement in the job market, new job seekers may enter or re-enter the labor force as employment grows."
35,"This increase in the participation rate would imply a total increase in the labor force (including the portion attributed to the rise in population) of some 350,000 people and hence a need for more than 330,000 net new jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising."
36,"In short, the unusual rate of productivity growth has driven a wedge between the recovery in output and the recovery in the labor market, leaving considerable cyclical slack in the labor market despite ongoing growth in output."
37,"The economic recovery will not be fully realized, in my view, until the labor market has established a more normal cyclical pattern of expansion.5 The Outlook for Inflation Forecasts of inflation, particularly core inflation (which excludes the more volatile energy and food price components), are of course another key input to monetary policy decisions."
38,The core inflation data for the past couple of months have been slightly above market expectations.
39,"More time will be needed to assess the significance of these recent numbers; possibly, they may reflect the unwinding of some downward surprises to core inflation late last year."
40,"Based on the information currently available, my own best guess is that core inflation has stopped falling and appears to be stabilizing in the vicinity of 1-1/2 percent, comfortably within my own preferred range of 1 to 2 percent."
41,The dominant fundamental factors influencing the inflation outlook are the ongoing resource slack and the remarkable rate of productivity growth.
42,"Moreover, price-cost margins are at high levels (as can be seen in the strong growth of profits), providing an additional cushion for absorbing any inflation pressures that may emerge on the cost side."
43,These forces should largely offset the effects on core consumer price inflation of the rising costs of raw materials--the byproduct of the gathering global recovery and continuing rapid growth in East Asia--and last year's decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
44,"As I discussed in some detail in a speech earlier this year (Bernanke, 2004a), the direct effects of commodity price increases and a depreciating dollar on inflation at the consumer level are generally small."
45,"In thinking about the implications of higher commodity prices for inflation, one should also make the distinction between a one-time rise in commodity prices and an ongoing process of commodity price inflation."
46,Commodity prices can only contribute to inflation at the consumer level when they are rapidly rising.
47,Commodity prices may well remain high in an absolute sense over the next few years because of the high global demand for raw materials.
48,"Yet if the rate of increase in commodity prices slows significantly, as is implied for example by futures prices, the effect of commodity prices on the rate of inflation will eventually become negligible."
49,"Similarly, dollar depreciation contributes to inflation only to the extent that it is ongoing; we cannot predict whether last year's decline in the dollar will continue, of course, but so far this year it has not."
50,"In describing what I consider to be the most likely scenario for inflation, I do not wish to convey an unwarranted degree of certainty."
51,"Like employment, inflation is difficult to forecast."
52,"One factor that may be of great importance in inflation determination but can be particularly hard to gauge is the state of the public's inflation expectations (Poole, 2004)."
53,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation."
54,"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored."
55,"If expectations are not well tied down, inflationary impulses that are in themselves transitory may become embedded in expectations and hence affect inflation in the longer term."
56,"Therefore, an essential prerequisite for controlling inflation is controlling inflation expectations."
57,Assessing the current state of inflation expectations in the United States is not entirely straightforward.
58,"Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations, including those based on interviews of professional forecasters, individual consumers, and firm managers, have in some cases ticked up slightly in recent months, though long-term inflation expectations appear stable."
59,"The spread between the yields on Treasury debt and inflation-indexed Treasury securities of similar maturity, known as the breakeven inflation rate and conventionally treated as an indicator of expected inflation, has also risen."
60,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context."
61,Headline inflation has of course been significantly affected by the recent surge in energy prices.
62,The breakeven inflation rate derived from indexed Treasury securities has additional problems as a measure of expected inflation.
63,"As I discussed in a recent speech (Bernanke, 2004b), breakeven inflation may differ substantially from the market's true expectation of inflation because of possibly time-varying risk and liquidity premiums."
64,"I will discuss inflation expectations further in the context of monetary policy, to which I turn next."
65,"Monetary Policy The federal funds rate stands at a historically low level of 1 percent, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has declared its intention to be ""patient in removing policy accommodation."""
66,"I base this statement on my view that the stance of monetary policy should be judged not only by the current setting of the federal funds rate but also by the level of rates that are tied directly or indirectly to expectations about the future path of monetary policy, of which the yields on Treasury securities are the leading examples."
67,"In part because of the FOMC's communication strategy, which has linked the future stance of policy to the level of inflation and the extent of slack in resource utilization, market interest rates have generally responded continuously and in a stabilizing manner to economic developments."
68,"The March employment report, which cited an unexpectedly high rate of job creation, provides a recent example."
69,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.
70,"Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate demand."
71,"For practical purposes, therefore, monetary conditions tightened significantly the day of the March employment report, notwithstanding the fact that the federal funds rate itself was unchanged."
72,This episode illustrates both the power and the importance of clear communication by monetary policymakers about their objectives and their evaluation of economic conditions.
73,"With respect to future decisions about the policy rate, for me two considerations are most relevant: first, the degree of confidence one can place in the sustainability of the economic expansion and, second, the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
74,"Indeed, if one takes into account the long delay between the official recession trough and the trough in employment, the labor market today remains at what effectively is an early stage of its normal cyclical expansion."
75,"Although the recent improvement in employment is encouraging, from the data in hand it is not yet clear that employers have overcome their reluctance to hire at a normal pace."
76,Additional confirmation that the recovery in the job market is both sustainable and quickening would be most welcome.
77,"Regarding inflation, as I noted earlier, the economic fundamentals appear consistent with core inflation's remaining under control, in the general range of 1 to 2 percent."
78,"In particular, I see no indication that the U.S. economy is in imminent danger of overheating, productivity growth is keeping the lid on labor costs, and the effects on inflation of the increases in commodity prices and the decline in the dollar to date, which are likely to be small in any event, may well have dissipated a year from now."
79,"As I have acknowledged, however, there are risks to my relatively sanguine inflation forecast."
80,"In particular, a rise in the public's expectations of inflation, whether ""justified"" by underlying forces or not, may put upward pressure on the actual rate of inflation."
81,"Moreover, expectations of inflation can themselves be destabilizing, as when an ""inflation scare"" in the bond market inappropriately raises long-term yields, with adverse effects for the real economy."
82,"To avoid instability in expected inflation, and the volatility in actual inflation, output, and employment that might result, I believe that the Federal Reserve should maintain at all costs its hard-won credibility for keeping the inflation rate low and stable."
83,"That involves, at a minimum, formulating policy with a close eye to indicators of inflation and inflation expectations."
84,"More generally, as I have suggested in earlier talks, I believe that the FOMC's credibility and clarity would be enhanced if it announced the inflation range with which it would be comfortable in the medium term (Bernanke, 2003a, 2003b)."
85,"In particular, policy would be both more coherent and more predictable if FOMC members shared an explicit common objective for inflation at the medium-term horizon."
86,"To conclude, monetary policy is now in a transition phase."
87,That short-term interest rates must eventually be normalized is a given.
