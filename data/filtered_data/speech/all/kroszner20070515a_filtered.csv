2,"Second, increased capital mobility is making it possible to finance ever larger current account deficits, and, indeed, these deficits have grown in recent years relative to the size of the global economy."
3,"According to estimates by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the developing economies as a group had a current account surplus of $640 billion last year (IMF, 2007a).3 Because the financial counterpart to this surplus is a deficit on the financial accounts, it represents the net capital outflow to the industrial economies."
4,"For example, in 1996 the combined current account balance of the developing economies was a deficit of $80 billion, representing a capital inflow of that amount from the industrial world."
5,"And about half of that was generated by the major oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and by Russia, whose surpluses ballooned in the past several years as oil prices soared."
6,"Thus, the other 131 developing economies in our data had a combined current account deficit, or net capital inflow, of $70 billion."
7,"This is not to say that things have not changed for these 131 countries in the past decade: In 1996, their combined current account deficit was twice as large as it was last year."
8,"Second, the relatively rapid income growth expected by developing economies as they catch up to industrial countries should provide them with incentives to borrow against their expected higher future incomes."
9,One approach to explaining the uphill flow of capital focuses on divergent patterns of growth and investment.
10,"According to one such view, the rise in U.S. productivity growth since the mid-1990s boosted perceived rates of return on U.S. assets and thus attracted capital; expectations of higher rates of return and higher incomes likely boosted U.S. investment and consumption spending as well (Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust, 2006; Ferguson, 2005)."
11,"The global saving glut argument suggests that developing economies have benefited from the recent pattern of global capital flows, gaining both demand for their products and a safe return on their assets at a time when an investment slump threatened to depress domestic activity and rates of return."
12,"The implications of the U.S. productivity story are a little harder to read, but developing economies, especially in Asia, likely have benefited from the expansion of investment and production opportunities created by the revolution in information technology."
13,"Neither the global saving glut nor the U.S. advantage in productivity growth, however, can be expected to persist indefinitely."
14,"In rapidly developing countries that have had high savings rates such as China, for example, consumption demand is likely to increase as they grow wealthier, thereby reducing their savings rates."
15,"Concerning productivity differences, it may require more than simply the diffusion and adoption of information technology around the globe."
16,"As I will come back to later, flexible labor, product, and financial markets appear to be crucial to reaping the full benefits of the information technology revolution, so national policy choices will play an important role in maintaining or closing productivity differences."
17,"A third set of explanations traces the emergence of current account deficits in the industrial countries, especially the United States, to increases in both public and private consumption which show up as declines in national savings rates.4 Some observers draw a less sanguine message from this approach than the first two mentioned above, namely, that current increases in consumption in the industrial economies could potentially cost them greater indebtedness and lower future consumption, and developing economies might then have less investment than otherwise."
18,"For example, concerning structural differences, as I discussed earlier, the aggregate current account balance of the developing economies turned to surplus only in the late 1990s; before then, it was in deficit, even though the financial sectors in those economies were, if anything, even less mature than they are today."
19,"That said, the financial-sector stories as well as the productivity stories I've reviewed probably are at least part of the explanation for the global pattern of capital flows."
20,Such policies lay the foundation for future economic growth as well as promise to alter the current pattern of capital flows and external balances.
21,"These kinds of institutional improvements would also help ensure that capital inflows are channeled in a growth-enhancing manner (Arteta, Eichengreen, and Wyplosz, 2003)."
22,"As noted above, I believe it will take more than simply investment in information technology (IT) for a country to enjoy the large productivity enhancements that can be brought about by the IT revolution (Kroszner 2003 and 2006b)."
23,"In this way, IT can contribute larger productivity improvements when an economy has flexible labor, product, and financial markets."
24,"To provide the greatest incentive for investment in the context of the IT revolution, business must operate in an environment that will permit them to transform themselves in ways that allow technology-intensive investment to have the highest possible effect on productivity growth."
25,"Similarly, labor markets must be flexible enough to allow for the prompt re-allocation of resources in response to changes in demand."
26,This underscores the importance of the overall regulatory and property rights environment to fostering investment necessary for productivity growth in emerging economies.
27,"Finally, prudent macroeconomic policies--fiscal consolidation and monetary policies aimed at price stability--are crucial to any effort to boost investment and attract financing (Kroszner 2003 and 2006b)."
28,"Inflation has been substantially reduced, and fiscal balances have been brought under control."
29,"Most notably, external borrowing increasingly is in the form of bonds denominated in domestic currency, often issued at fixed interest rates, and dated for long maturities, in contrast to the foreign-currency instruments that dominated external borrowing in earlier years."
30,"When entities in the emerging markets borrowed in foreign currencies, they bore the exchange rate risk while lenders bore default risk."
31,"With domestic-currency financing, lenders now bear most of the exchange rate risk."
32,"And with fixed-rate bonds, the interest rate risk, too, is being shifted to the lenders."
33,"These low yields are part of a more general decline in compensation for risk in emerging markets, a trend also evidenced by low risk spreads on dollar-denominated bonds and rising stock prices."
34,"To raise incomes and reduce poverty, the developing economies must boost their productivity, and that, in turn, will require complementing their large and growing labor forces with increasing quantities of capital."
35,"In the past, current account deficits in the emerging-market economies were frequently the outcome of large budget deficits and inappropriate exchange rate regimes, and I am certainly not calling for a return to such policies."
36,"Rather, a swing in net capital flows back toward the developing economies would best be achieved through policies they need--regardless of their effect on external balances--to promote capital formation and economic growth."
37,"By the same token, industrial countries can undertake policies to enhance their prospects for solid, sustainable growth that would also have the effect of altering the current pattern of international capital flows."
