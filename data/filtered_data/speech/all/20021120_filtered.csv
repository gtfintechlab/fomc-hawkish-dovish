0,The interest rate risk inherent in home mortgages is still present in mortgage-backed securities.
1,"One common strategy for hedging the interest rate risk of a mortgage-backed security is to short other fixed-income instruments, such as ten-year Treasury notes or interest rate swaps."
2,"But unlike most other fixed-income securities, mortgage-backed securities carry prepayment risk, which causes a change in the level of interest rates to change the amount of Treasuries or swaps one needs to short for an effective hedge."
3,"Specifically, when interest rates fall, prepayments increase, and as a result, the amount of ten-year Treasuries needed for the hedge falls."
4,"Thus, to reduce a short position in ten-year Treasuries, the hedger must buy ten-year Treasuries when their price is rising."
5,"Such ""dynamic"" hedgers of mortgage-backed-securities have adopted a strategy that requires them to buy bonds when the price of bonds is rising."
6,"Conversely, they must sell bonds when the price of bonds is falling."
7,"Clearly, if these hedging-related transactions are large relative to the underlying market, the hedging strategy could make significant demands on market liquidity and lead to higher market volatility."
8,Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York covering the years 1996 through 2000 and also the monetary policy tightening in spring 1994 has found hedging-related effects to be present in U.S. dollar interest rate movements.
9,"Although the effect was large enough to be detectable, it was small relative to overall interest rate volatility and lasted no longer than six weeks."
10,"One way is through the acquisition of interest rate options, either by buying an option, such as a so-called swaption, or by issuing callable debt that has an option embedded in it."
11,"At the same time, some have suggested that the hedging of prepayment risk by buying interest options has begun to affect price dynamics in the options market."
12,"Dynamic hedging would become less effective and, as a result, the risk premium associated with exposure to the interest rate risk of mortgage-backed securities would rise."
13,The rise in the risk premium would reduce the demand for hedging by inducing some homeowners to switch to adjustable-rate mortgages.
14,"As all of us are probably aware, the old model concentrated interest rate risk in depository institutions, specifically in savings and loans."
15,"And when interest rates soared in the early 1980s, the savings and loan industry suffered huge losses with collateral effects on the real economy."
16,"In comparison, the market-based model clearly seems to have spread the interest rate risk of mortgages throughout the economy, with depository institutions still bearing some of the risk through investments in mortgage-backed securities or callable debt."
17,"Second, I would note that new risk-transfer instruments, such as swaps and swaptions, are playing an important role in transferring the interest rate risk of mortgages to a broader and more diversified group of investors."
18,What is the role for policymakers in overseeing the growth of formal risk-measurement models?
19,"According to market sources, this rapid growth continues unabated."
20,Banks have been an important engine behind the growth of credit derivatives.
21,"The price of a credit derivative should take into consideration the credit risk posed by the seller of the protection and the appropriate default correlation, though default correlations are difficult to estimate precisely."
22,"Although regulatory capital arbitrage was cited as a factor spurring the early growth of the credit derivatives market, the increasingly active portfolio management of credit risk, by both banks and insurance companies, has driven growth of the market in recent years."
23,These large defaults give us some insight into one of the concerns I mentioned earlier--that the growth of the credit derivatives market was being driven by investors who did not understand the risks they were taking on.
24,What should financial policymakers do in response to the rapid growth in the credit derivatives market?
