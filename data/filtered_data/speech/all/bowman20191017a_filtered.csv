2,"October 17, 2019 Opening Remarks Governor Michelle W. Bowman At ""Monetary Policyâ€™s Impact on Workers and Their Communities,"" a Fed Listens event, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois Share Watch Live Thank you, President Evans, for hosting this event today, and to our moderator and participants for taking part in this valuable discussion."
3,Today's event is the last in our series of Fed Listens events held across the country to learn about how Americans think about monetary policy and how they think about the Federal Reserve.
4,Fed Listens is a new comprehensive outreach to the public on monetary policy.
5,For many decades there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn't interested or even willing to dive into the complexities of monetary policy.
6,"When we communicate our views on the economic outlook and our expectations for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and businesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending, investment, and hiring."
7,We have heard from many people from different parts of the country and from different sectors of the economy about how monetary policy affects them and their communities.
8,Hearing a broad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we consider new approaches to monetary policy.
9,"Our monetary policy review will have implications for financial markets, but we also want to know more about what the impact will be on Main Street."
10,The two goals for monetary policyâ€”maximum employment and stable pricesâ€”are determined by the Congress and are not subject to our framework review.
11,"For example, inflation has run modestly below our 2 percent objective for many years."
12,"Given that, it would be helpful to hear whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider strategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a period of time to make up for the earlier shortfall or whether you think that would threaten the decades of success the Fed has had keeping the public's inflation expectations low and stable."
13,Another question concerns the Fed's existing toolkit for monetary policy.
14,"Currently, our available policy tools include setting interest rates, purchasing longer-term assets, and forward guidance about the expected future path of policy."
15,Your perspectives on questions like these are a vital part of this monetary policy review.
