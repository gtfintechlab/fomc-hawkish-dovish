0,"Recently, homeownership rates have reached record levels, thanks, in large measure, to technological innovations that allow for risk-based pricing of loans, along with the rapid growth of the subprime mortgage market."
1,"Today, after significant changes in the mortgage market brought on by technological advances, deregulation, and financial innovation, the credit availability question is no longer limited to whether minority borrowers have access to credit but, rather, at what price that credit is available."
2,"Moreover, there are new questions about whether the price of credit always reflects the lender's risk or cost, or whether it is tied in any way to the race or sex of the borrower."
3,The technological changes have led to strong growth in the subprime mortgage market.
4,"In general, this growth appears to be a positive development."
5,"Taking these concerns and public comments into consideration, the Federal Reserve determined that information on loan prices was critical to gaining insight into the functioning of the higher-cost mortgage market."
6,HMDA data have been used to identify credit demand that might otherwise have been overlooked.
7,"With the addition of price data for higher-priced loans, the agencies will be able to more easily identify price disparities that require investigation."
8,The public disclosure of price information under HMDA--in the form of spreads between the annual percentage rate (APR) on a loan and the rate on Treasury securities of comparable maturity--is designed to ensure that the data continue to be useful in improving market efficiency and legal compliance.
9,"The APR represents the cost of credit to the consumer and captures the contract-based interest rate on a loan as well as the points and fees that consumers pay up front, converted to a percentage rate."
10,"But since these fees have to be amortized over the term of the loan to calculate the APR, and since interest rates vary over time, even the APR can be difficult to use as a basis of comparison across loans."
11,"Although the addition of the price data significantly increases the robustness of HMDA data, the data alone do not prove discrimination."
12,"Instead, the data will be used as a screen to identify any aspects of the higher-priced end of the mortgage market that warrant closer scrutiny."
13,"Because these important determinants of price are missing, one cannot draw definitive conclusions about whether particular lenders discriminate unlawfully or take unfair advantage of consumers based solely on a review of the HMDA data."
14,"Until now, in determining whether a lender is discriminating in its pricing decisions, examiners have relied on several factors: the relationship between loan pricing and compensation of loan officers or brokers; lender policies giving loan officers broad pricing discretion; the use of empirically based and statistically sound risk-based pricing systems; disparities among prices quoted or charged to applicants who differ in their protected characteristics (such as race); and consumer complaints alleging price discrimination."
15,"As a result, lenders may take opportunities to compete in areas where the data show concentrations of high-priced lending."
16,"Competitive pressures in such markets should increase efficiency in pricing, ensuring that prices for mortgages are commensurate with risk and do not just reflect an absence of competition."
17,"Finally, increased importance will be placed on the value of financial education to help consumers shop for and obtain the mortgage loan that represents the best price and terms for their financial situation and needs."
18,The annual subprime market growth rate over this time was a whopping 27 percent.
19,The initial data also suggest that prevalence of higher-priced loans differs notably across racial and ethnic groups.
20,"As some press accounts have implied, the data indicate that blacks and Hispanics are more likely to take out higher-priced loans than non-Hispanic whites, and that Asians are the least likely to have higher-priced loans."
21,These preliminary data also seem to indicate that the actual prices paid by those taking out higher-priced loans are about the same for different racial groups.
22,"No one will be served if lenders are unwilling to enter, or remain in, certain higher-priced segments of the market."
