0,"This afternoon, I want to share with you some thoughts on the roles that the Federal Reserve and financial institutions are playing in supporting the affordable housing market and then touch on some challenges we face in sustaining the growth of affordable housing finance."
1,Monetary Policy and Affordable Housing Let me begin with a few words about the role that monetary policy can and cannot play in promoting affordable housing.
2,Interest rates certainly are an important element in the housing affordability calculus.
3,It might therefore appear that the Federal Reserve could make a significant contribution to housing affordability by working to keep interest rates low.
4,"What monetary policy can do Monetary policy can, at least indirectly, make an important contribution to affordable housing, by pursuing price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the dual mandate that Congress has established for the Federal Reserve."
5,"First, by promoting price stability, monetary policy can keep nominal interest rates low."
6,"Whereas most forms of spending depend primarily on real interest rates, the housing market is significantly affected by nominal interest rates which greatly influence the ability of borrowers to qualify for and service mortgages."
7,"Because nominal interest rates rise and fall with changes in inflation expectations, the pursuit of price stability directly contributes to low nominal interest rates."
8,"Second, to the extent that the Federal Reserve is successful in helping maintain maximum sustainable employment, it will contribute to a healthy economic environment of stable and high levels of income and employment."
9,Clearly recessions and periods of high unemployment increase economic stress and exacerbate affordable housing problems.
10,"What monetary policy cannot do I am often asked whether monetary policy is capable of doing still more, of making a conscious and direct effort to remedy social problems, including affordable housing, above and beyond what it can accomplish indirectly by pursuing its traditional macroeconomic objectives."
11,"Specifically, shouldnâ€™t the Fed lower interest rates or avoid raising rates to support social policy objectives, such as affordable housing?"
12,The reason why the Federal Reserve should not take on this commitment is that it exceeds the limits of what monetary policy can deliver.
13,"We have one policy instrument, a short-term interest rate, and two macroeconomic objectives, full employment and price stability."
14,Pursuing these broad macroeconomic objectives is truly a full-time job for monetary policy.
15,"In particular, monetary policy cannot target particular quintiles of the income distribution, particular regions or communities, or particular sectors of the economy."
16,"Fortunately, by pursuing its broad macroeconomics objectives, monetary policy can make an important indirect contribution to affordable housing."
17,"Other Federal Reserve Efforts in Support of Affordable Housing The Federal Reserve can and does play a more direct supporting role in promoting affordable housing, above and beyond the indirect contribution from monetary policy, in a variety of ways."
18,"The Affordable Housing Marketplace But when monetary policy has done all it can do, there will still be an affordable housing problem."
19,"There are still a number of challenges to meeting the demand for affordable housing, and more may be on the horizon."
20,"Community development projects usually require longer term, fixed-rate financing to achieve affordability for renters or buyers and financial institutions have difficulty funding such loans without incurring unacceptable interest rate risk."
21,"But the number of loans to black households increased by only 3% over 1995 levels, the smallest growth experienced by this group in recent years."
22,"Since 1993, even with only the modest growth in 1996, loans to black households are up 53% while loans made to whites are up 14%."
23,We are continuing to look at the data to determine the possible reasons for the slower growth in loans to black borrowers in 1996 and the increase in application denial rates for all racial and ethnic groups.
24,"Inflation is at a 30-year low, the unemployment rate is at a 24-year low, and housing affordability remains favorable."
