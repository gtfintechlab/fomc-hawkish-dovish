0,The FOMC noted on August 17 that financial market conditions deteriorated last month and that the associated tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.
1,"Indeed, at this point, housing demand seems likely to be crimped further by a marked reduction in the availability of mortgages, and consumer and business spending also could be damped as a consequence of the recent financial turmoil."
2,"In light of these events, we will need to make the best possible real-time judgments about the extent to which the recent developments in financial markets are likely to affect economic activity in the period ahead."
3,"Of course, the jump in growth followed a sluggish first-quarter gain: That choppiness in growth reflected large swings in several factors that are often volatile, including inventory investment, federal defense outlays, and net exports."
4,"Smoothing through this volatility, the underlying pattern of activity in the first half of the year essentially represented a continuation of the moderate growth that had prevailed since the spring of last year when growth in real gross domestic product stepped down from an above-trend pace."
5,The step-down in the growth of real output that began in mid-2006 and proceeded through the middle of this year primarily reflected weakness in the housing market.
6,Declines in real residential investment subtracted nearly 1-1/4 percentage points from the growth of real GDP in the second half of last year and about 3/4 percentage point in the first half of this year.
7,"Moreover, the demand for housing appears to be weakening further amid credit conditions for home mortgage lending that are generally tighter, but especially so in the subprime segment."
8,"Given this sizable backlog and the likelihood that sales will remain weak or weaken further in coming months, cutbacks in housing construction are likely to continue to be a drag on economic activity in future quarters."
9,"To some extent, a moderation from the very rapid pace of growth around the turn of the year probably was to be expected."
10,"In the second quarter, in particular, a jump in energy prices eroded the purchasing power of gains in household income, placing downward pressure on the growth of real spending at that point."
11,This summerâ€™s retrenchment in equity markets and the sharp deceleration in house prices have damped gains in household wealth this year and are likely to restrain consumer outlays.
12,"In the second quarter, however, demand for these other types of equipment bounced back strongly, and the gains were extended in July--as reported in the most recent data on orders and shipments of capital goods."
13,"We have no direct readings on capital spending in August, but the limited indicators currently in hand--such as the Institute for Supply Managementâ€™s survey of purchasing managers--have held up reasonably well and remain at levels consistent with modest growth in manufacturing production and business investment."
14,That growth should continue to stimulate demand for U.S. exports of goods and services.
15,"Turning to the labor market, payroll employment has weakened."
16,"As for the economyâ€™s longer-run growth rate, a key determinant is the trend in labor productivity."
17,"As you know, from 1995 to 2000, productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent, well above the lackluster pace of the preceding twenty-five years."
18,"Then, remarkably, productivity accelerated further, rising at an average of about 3-1/2 percent per year for the first three years of this decade, despite the challenges of a recession, the fall of the dot-com market, a broad stock market correction, and the terrorist attacks."
19,"Since the middle of 2004, however, the growth of labor productivity has slowed, registering an average annual rate of about 1-1/4 percent."
20,"Previously, that figure had looked higher, but this summerâ€™s annual revision of the national income and product accounts marked down productivity growth over the 2004 to 2006 period by an average of 0.3 percentage point per year."
21,Part of the recent deceleration in productivity almost surely reflects a typical cyclical response to a slowing economy.
22,"The latest evidence suggests that structural productivity might be increasing somewhat more slowly than it did during the second half of the 1990s, but the confidence band around any such estimate of trend productivity growth surely is very wide.2 These issues remain an area of active debate, the outcome of which will be essential for gauging the economyâ€™s potential rate of growth going forward."
23,Let me turn now to inflation and inflation dynamics.
24,"Over the past year, the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 2.1 percent, down from nearly 3-1/2 percent during the comparable period twelve months earlier."
25,"Recently, topline inflation has been boosted by sizable increases in food prices; energy-price increases slowed considerably over the past twelve months after sizable advances in earlier years."
26,"Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices decelerated over the past year; the July reading on the twelve-month change stood at 1.9 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point less than it was a year earlier."
27,"In my view, inflation expectations have been a key element in the recent performance of core inflation."
28,"By a range of measures, inflation expectations appear to have remained contained even as headline inflation moved temporarily higher."
29,"According to the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, the median expectation of inflation five to ten years ahead has been essentially flat since the beginning of last year."
30,"In addition, measures of long-run inflation compensation derived from spreads between yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities have not pushed above the range that has prevailed in the past couple of years."
31,"As I discussed in a speech earlier this year, I read the evidence as suggesting that householdsâ€™ long-run inflation expectations are consistent with PCE price inflation in the neighborhood of 2 percent.3 To be sure, this figure is sensitive to the assumptions used to tease such estimates from the available data, so I do not want to overstate its precision."
32,"Still, the professional forecasters surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed also project PCE inflation to be close to 2 percent over the next five to ten years."
33,"As I look at the incoming inflation data, I would judge them to be consistent with expectations in this range; moreover, I believe that having expectations reasonably well anchored in this range has been a helpful influence on the path of actual inflation."
34,"However, let me be clear: I do not subscribe to a deus ex machina view of the inflation process, in which inflation is driven solely by inflation expectations and is little influenced by the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply."
35,"Indeed, I take the view that expectations of future resource utilization are also an important factor affecting inflation outcomes."
36,"If households and businesses believe that the Federal Reserve will set monetary policy in a way that keeps aggregate demand in reasonable alignment with aggregate supply over time, then expectations of future resource utilization will be stable, and current resource utilization will provide less information about future inflation movements."
37,"In that situation, which I believe describes the current environment, inflation expectations will be a key driver of inflation dynamics."
38,The stable inflation expectations we have seen lately derive from confidence that monetary policy will keep inflation under control.
39,"If monetary policy allowed aggregate demand to get out of sync with supply and if the Fed was not expected to bring demand back into balance with supply, then inflation expectations would be much less likely to remain stable."
40,This is why I believe that the Federal Reserve must remain vigilant on inflation but give appropriate attention to keeping demand from falling below supply as well.
41,What does this all mean for the inflation outlook?
42,And I would expect the pressures on inflation that we have experienced from food and energy prices to abate.
43,"Accordingly, with inflation expectations remaining stable around their current level, I see inflation as remaining in alignment with long-run expectations at around a 2 percent pace for the PCE deflator."
44,"In addition, I believe that the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced, given the greater downside risks to real growth."
45,"Indeed, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act indicate that about 25 percent of the loans used to purchase single-family, owner-occupied homes in 2005 were high-priced loans, including primarily subprime and some near-prime mortgages.5 However, as has been the case in previous instances of rapid financial innovations, adequate mechanisms to control excessive risk-taking may not have been in place during the subprime marketâ€™s greatest growth."
46,"Against a backdrop of continued strong investor demand for high-yielding securities, some lenders began loosening underwriting standards for subprime mortgages in late 2005."
47,"Had house prices kept appreciating, loan-to-value ratios would have fallen and some borrowers would have been able to refinance, perhaps into a prime loan with a lower interest rate."
48,"But, instead, as the housing market softened and interest rates rose, delinquencies in the adjustable-rate subprime market began to soar and reached nearly 15 percent in July.6 Among other types of nonprime mortgages, delinquencies on fixed-rate subprime mortgages have been fairly steady at less than 6 percent; rates on mortgages in alt-A pools have increased to nearly 3 percent, up notably from the 1 percent rate of only a year ago."
49,These developments have contributed materially to the drop in demand for housing this year.
50,"Bond spreads--especially those for speculative-grade debt--widened substantially in June and July, and the volatility of equity prices increased as well."
51,"As best we can tell thus far, the imprint of these developments on economic activity appears likely to be most pronounced in the housing sector."
52,"However, economic activity could be affected more severely in other sectors should heightened uncertainty lead to a broader pullback in household and business spending."
53,"That scenario cannot, in my view, be ruled out, and I believe it poses an important downside risk to economic activity."
