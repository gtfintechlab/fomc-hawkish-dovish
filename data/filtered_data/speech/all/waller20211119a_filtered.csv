0,"Let me take the next several minutes to speak about the continued improvement of the U.S. economy, recent inflation data, and their implications for monetary policy.1 I will also discuss the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) recent decision to begin reducing monthly purchases of securities and how incoming data may affect the pace of tapering."
1,"Since I last spoke on the subject exactly a month ago, the basic shape of my outlook hasn't changed: The economy continues to grow and add jobs at a strong pace, making steady progress toward the Federal Reserve's goal of maximum employment."
2,New data shows that employment gains were better than first reported in August and September and were back to a strong level in October.
3,"Due to a combining of those supply constraints with strong demand, inflation pressures are becoming more widespread and may last longer into 2022 than I thought they would."
4,"These factors haven't dented my optimism that the strong recovery will continue but they have raised the risks that supply constraints may limit job gains and output growth, and that inflation may complicate the FOMC's management of monetary policy in 2022."
5,"These factors weighed on output growth in the third quarter, which was down considerably from the three months before but which I expect will rise again to a strong rate in the fourth quarter."
6,"The Delta variant and supply chain problems threw the economy off its very strong growth track in the third quarter, but I anticipate it will return to that path in the fourth quarter, as society continues to learn how to manage the disease and ever-improving treatments reduce the likelihood of death and hospitalization."
7,"Assuming another damaging COVID-19 variant does not arise this winter, I expect gross domestic product (GDP) to resume its robust growth not only in the fourth quarter of 2021 but also in the first half of 2022."
8,"In terms of the job market, households and businesses perceive that conditions are as tight as or tighter than they were pre-COVID, even though the unemployment rate is more than a percentage point higher."
9,There are certainly ample data showing labor demand is very strong.
10,The improvement I expect in managing COVID should drive demand higher but also provide a boost to labor supply as those who have been on the sidelines return to a job market that keeps improving.
11,"With respect to employment data, revisions to the August and September job numbers indicated that the summer slowdown in job gains wasn't nearly as bad as initial reports suggested."
12,"Regarding the unemployment rate, in October the rate stood at 4.6 percent."
13,"If the decline continues at about that pace in coming months, the unemployment rate could be below 4 percent before too long."
14,"In light of these data, in my view, the labor market is rapidly approaching maximum employment."
15,"Turning to inflation, inflation has escalated substantially this year, along with a significant rise in inflation expectations."
16,The October consumer price index report showed an unexpected surge in inflation.
17,"Despite the highest wage gains in years, inflation this year has wiped out any real wage increase for the average worker."
18,High inflation is painful to Americans who have little choice about the goods and services they buy for everyday living.
19,"Prices are up significantly at the grocery store, which is a major problem for many individuals and families."
20,"Unlike earlier this summer, price pressures are no longer concentrated in a few categories, they appear to have broadened.2 There has been a notable increase in the prices of energy, food, goods, and services as well as the cost of owning a home."
21,"Even trimmed mean measures of inflation that exclude some big price increases, such as the Cleveland Fed and the Dallas Fed measures, report inflation rates above the Fed's 2 percent target."
22,"Diffusion indexes of price changes, which are often useful in detecting turning points in the data, show an increasing number of categories with 3 or 12-month inflation exceeding 3 percent, compared with earlier this year."
23,"I expect that these pressures are related to both supply constraints, which may be beginning to improve, and strong demand, which shows no sign of abating."
24,"Wages continue to grow quickly on a more sustained basis than they have in more than 20 years, most recently reflected in a striking increase in the employment cost index, which considers both pay and benefits."
25,Wages and employment costs seem to be widespread across industries and among businesses of different sizes.
26,Crucial to the path of inflation will be whether we see input cost increases consistently reflected in final goods prices.
27,"It has been argued that because price pressures connected to supply constraints are transitory, they will come to an end, so monetary policy does not need to respond to temporary price pressures."
28,"Second, the macroeconomic models we use to guide policy typically have cost shocks built in that cause inflation to move."
29,"In those models, appropriate monetary policy responds to these inflation movements; it doesn't ignore them, even though they are transitory."
30,"To me, the inflation data are starting to look a lot more like a big snowfall that will stay on the ground for a while, and that development is affecting my expectations of the level of monetary accommodation that is needed going forward."
31,Inflation expectations on the part of the public also play a role in the conduct of monetary policy.
32,"Two surveys of consumersâ€”by the University of Michigan and the New York Fedâ€”show medium inflation expectations running over 4 percent, and bond investors are requiring over 3 percent compensation for future inflation and inflation risks."
33,It is very concerning to me that households and markets are no longer expecting us to keep inflation near our 2 percent target over the next three to five years.
34,"Now, it is true that there is some evidence that these consumer survey measures of future inflation tend to move around a lot based on changes in current inflation."
35,So I hope these large movements in inflation expectations areâ€”wait for itâ€”transitory and will come back down as bottlenecks and labor shortages resolve themselves over the coming months.
36,"But if these measures were to continue moving upward, I would become concerned that expectations would lead households to demand higher wages to compensate for expected inflation, which could raise inflation in the near term and keep it elevated for some time."
37,This possibility is a risk to the inflation outlook that I'm watching carefully.
38,"So, what are the implications of all these considerations for monetary policy?"
39,"If COVID or some other factor substantially slows the recovery, hindering the progress toward maximum employment, the FOMC could slow the taper."
40,"But if the economy makes quick progress toward maximum employment or inflation data show no signs of retreating from their currently high readings, the Committee may choose to speed up the taper, which would position it to accelerate subsequent steps in tightening monetary policy if necessary."
41,"The timing of any policy action is a decision for the FOMC, but for my part the rapid improvement in the labor market and the deteriorating inflation data have pushed me towards favoring a faster pace of tapering and a more rapid removal of accommodation in 2022."
42,"They are when the economy has reached maximum employment, and when inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
43,"Assuming inflation expectations are well-anchored, I judge that the timing of liftoff is any time after both of these conditions have been met."
44,I believe the condition for inflation has been met and we are making great strides towards achieving the employment leg of our mandate.
45,"After that point, whenever the Committee ultimately decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate from zero, monetary policy will still be providing an extraordinary extent of support for the economyâ€”short-term interest rates will still be very low, and the large amount of securities holdings on the Fed's balance sheet will continue to put significant downward pressure on longer-term interest rates."
46,It is important to remember that the FOMC makes monetary policy decisions with the best interest of the American people in mind and not based on how these actions affect the balance sheet.
47,The standing repurchase agreement facility provides a backstop in cases where demand for liquidity is more than the Fed otherwise thought.
48,Then the Fed will turn to normalizing other aspects of monetary policy as the economy continues to recover from the severe COVID shock we encountered last year.
