0,"Just as we were forced to adapt and innovate in meeting our liquidity provision responsibilities, we also needed to adapt and innovate in the conduct of monetary policy."
1,"We needed to go further--much further, in fact--to ease financial conditions and thus encourage spending and support employment."
2,"We took steps to reinforce public understanding of our inflation objective to prevent the development of deflationary expectations; we provided guidance on the possible future course of our policy interest rate; and we purchased large amounts of longer-term securities, and in the process created unprecedented volumes of bank reserves."
3,"My discussion today will focus on innovations in both our role as liquidity provider and in our monetary policy tools: their motivation, their effectiveness, and their lessons for the future."
4,"1 The Federal Reserve's Liquidity Tools Before the crisis, the implementation of monetary policy was fairly straightforward, and our approach minimized its footprint on financial markets."
5,"As a result, intermediaries unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the crisis; moreover, they were unwilling to assume the risks necessary to make markets in the debt and securitization instruments that were critical channels supporting household and business borrowing--and households and businesses unable to borrow were thus unable to spend, thereby deepening the recession."
6,"An important aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which loans that might in the past have remained on the books of banks are instead converted into securities and sold to investors in global capital markets."
7,"By lending to solvent institutions against illiquid collateral, central banks effectively step in to assume the liquidity risk of such assets--that is, the risk that assets can only be sold in the near term at fire sale prices."
8,"For the most part, the Federal Reserve priced these facilities to be attractive when markets were disrupted but not economical to potential borrowers as market functioning improved."
9,"To be sure, limiting a panic mitigates the erosion of asset prices and hence capital, but central banks are not the appropriate authorities to supply capital directly; if government capital is necessary to promote financial stability, then that is a fiscal function."
10,"While the overall improvement in the economic outlook has no doubt contributed to the improvement in ABS markets, it does appear that the TALF helped to buoy the availability of credit to firms and households and thus supported economic activity."
11,"Of note, usage of these emergency liquidity facilities declined markedly as conditions in financial markets improved, indicating that they were indeed priced at a penalty to more normal market conditions."
12,"Monetary Policy and the Zero Bound The Federal Reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 2008 not only by opening new emergency liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to close to zero and taking other steps to ease financial conditions."
13,"After short-term rates reached the effective zero bound in December 2008, the Federal Reserve also acted to shape interest rate and inflation expectations through various communications."
14,This language was intended to provide more guidance than usual about the likely path of interest rates and to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly uncertain economic and financial environment.
15,"By noting that the federal funds rate was likely to remain at ""exceptionally low"" levels for an ""extended period,"" the FOMC likely was able to keep long-term interest rates lower than would otherwise have been the case."
16,"To provide the public with more context for understanding monetary policy decisions, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents agreed in late 2007 to prepare more frequent forecasts covering longer time spans and explain those forecasts."
17,"In January 2009, the policymakers also added information about their views of the long-run levels to which economic growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate were likely to converge over time."
18,"The additional clarity about the long-run level for inflation, in particular, likely helped keep inflation expectations anchored during the crisis."
19,"Had expectations followed inflation down, real interest rates would have increased, restraining spending further."
20,"Thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, the Federal Reserve initiated large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, specifically Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency debt."
21,How effective have these various steps been in reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses while maintaining price stability?
22,The reduction of the policy interest rate to close to zero led to a sharp decline in the cost of funds in money markets--especially when combined with the creation of emergency liquidity facilities and the establishment of liquidity swaps with foreign central banks that greatly narrowed spreads in short-term funding markets.
23,"Market participants reportedly interpreted the characterization of the federal funds rate as likely to remain low for ""an extended period"" as stronger than the ""for some time"" language included in the previous statement.5 Nonetheless, the extended period language has not prevented interest rates and market participants' expectations about the timing of exit from the zero interest rate policy from reacting to incoming economic information, though each repetition of the extended period language has appeared to affect those expectations a little."
24,"In these circumstances, purchasing longer-term assets (and thus taking interest rate risk from the market) pushes up the prices of the securities, thereby lowering their yields."
25,"Currently, we are relying in large part on event studies analyzing how much interest rates declined when purchases were announced in the United States or abroad."
26,"A similar pattern for Treasury yields was observed following the release of the March 2009 FOMC statement, when purchases of longer-term Treasury securities were announced.6 Effectiveness, however, is hard to quantify, partly because we are uncertain about how, exactly, the purchases put downward pressure on interest rates."
27,"In explanations of our actions during the crisis, we have focused on the effects of our purchases on the prices of the assets that we bought and on the spillover to the prices of related assets, as I have just done."
28,"This view, however, is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to the money supply to economic activity and inflation."
29,"To date, this channel does not seem to have been effective: Interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks remain elevated, the quantity of bank loans is still falling, and money supply growth has been subdued."
30,"Banks' behavior appears more consistent with the standard Keynesian model of the liquidity trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates approach zero."
31,Another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale purchases of longer-term assets on inflation expectations.
32,"The more we buy, the more reserves we will ultimately need to absorb, and the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet can return completely to normal."
33,"As a consequence, these types of purchases can increase inflation expectations among some observers who may see a risk that we will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion."
34,"So far, longer-term inflation expectations have generally been well anchored over the past few years of unusual Federal Reserve actions."
35,"However, many unsettled issues remain regarding the linkage between central bank actions and inflation expectations, and concerns about the effect of the size of our balance sheet are often heard in financial market commentary."
36,"Lesson from Conducting Monetary Policy in a Crisis It is certainly too soon to fully assess all the lessons learned concerning the conduct of monetary policy during the crisis, but a few observations seem worth noting even at this early stage."
37,"First, commitments to maintain interest rates at a given level must be properly conditioned on the evolution of the economy."
38,"If they are to achieve their objectives, central banks cannot make unconditional interest rate commitments based only on a time dimension."
39,"To further clarify that the ""extended period"" language is conditional on the evolution of the economy, the FOMC emphasized in the November 2009 statement that its expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain at an ""exceptionally low"" level for an ""extended period"" depended on the outlook for resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations following the anticipated trajectories."
40,"Second, as I previously pointed out, firmly anchored inflation expectations are essential to successful monetary policy at any time."
41,"That's why central banks have not followed the standard academic recommendation to set a higher inflation target--either temporarily or, as has been recently suggested, over the longer run--to reduce the likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound."
42,"Although I agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, I do not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets."
43,Central banks around the world have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by businesses and households when making decisions about the future.
44,"Moreover, inflation expectations are well anchored at those low levels."
45,Increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse economic outcomes over time.
46,Inflation expectations would necessarily have to become unanchored as inflation moved up.
47,"Instead, I fear there could be a long learning process, just as when inflation trended down over recent decades."
48,"Moreover, a higher inflation target might also mean that inflation would be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise transitory inflation would become more persistent."
49,"For both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other economic conditions."
50,It could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.
51,"It is notable that while the theoretical economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis."
52,The lower rates on mortgages helped households that could refinance and supported demand to help stabilize the housing market.
53,"Fourth, central banks also need to be mindful of the potential effects on inflation expectations of the expansion of their balance sheet."
54,Most policymakers do not tend to put too much stock in the very simple theories relating excess reserves to money and inflation that I mentioned earlier.
55,"But we are aware that the size of our balance sheet is a potential source of policy stimulus, and we need to be alert to the risk that households, businesses, and investors could begin to expect higher inflation based partly on an expanded central bank balance sheet."
56,"As always, the Federal Reserve monitors inflation developments and inflation expectations very closely and any signs of a significant deterioration in the inflation outlook would be a matter of concern to the FOMC."
57,"Fifth, central banks need to have the tools to reverse unusual actions--to drain reserves and raise interest rates--when the time comes."
58,Confidence in those tools should help allay any fears by the public that unusual actions will necessarily lead to inflation.
59,"In the case of the Federal Reserve, our ability to pay interest on excess reserves, which we received only in September 2008, is a very important tool that made us more comfortable taking extraordinary steps when they were needed; it allows us to put upward pressure on short-term interest rates even with very elevated levels of reserves."
60,"Finally, let me close with some comments on a ""lesson learned"" that some observers have emphasized--that long periods of low interest rates inevitably lead to financial imbalances, and that the Federal Reserve should adjust its policy setting to avoid the buildup of such imbalances."
61,"As I have indicated at other times, I don't think we know enough at this point to answer with any confidence the question of whether monetary policy should include financial stability along with price stability and high employment in its objectives."
62,"Given the bluntness of monetary policy as a tool for addressing developments that could lead to financial instability, given the side effects of using policy for this purpose (including the likely increase in variability of inflation and economic activity over the medium term), and given the need for timely policy action to realize greater benefits than costs in leaning against potential speculative excesses, my preference at this time is to use prudential regulation and supervision to strengthen the financial system and lean against developing financial imbalances."
63,"I don't minimize the difficulties of executing effective macroprudential supervision, nor do I rule out using interest rate policy in circumstances in which dangerous imbalances are building and prudential steps seem to be delayed or ineffective; but I do think regulation can be better targeted to the developing problem and the balance of costs and benefits from using these types of instruments are far more likely to be favorable than from using monetary policy to achieve financial stability."
64,Monetary policymakers must ask whether the strategies and tools at their disposal need to be adapted to fulfill their responsibilities for price and economic stability in modern financial markets.
