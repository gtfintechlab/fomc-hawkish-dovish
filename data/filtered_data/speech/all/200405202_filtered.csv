0,"This relatively slow adjustment of the policy rate has been referred to variously as interest-rate smoothing, partial adjustment, and monetary policy inertia."
1,"As always, I emphasize that my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System do not necessarily share the views I will express today.1 Gradualism and Policymaker Uncertainty Several arguments have been made for the desirability of a gradualist approach to monetary policy."
2,Today I will focus on three of these: (1) Policymakers' uncertainty about the economy should lead to more gradual adjustment of the policy rate; (2) gradualism in adjusting the policy rate affords policymakers greater influence over the long-term interest rates that most affect the economy; and (3) gradualism reduces risks to financial stability.
3,"In a policy context, the analogous situation is one in which policymakers hope to guide the economy in a particular direction but fear overshooting, either to the inflationary upside or the recessionary downside."
4,"Overshooting the objective of stable, non-inflationary growth is perceived as costly by policymakers because overshooting creates unnecessary volatility in the economy and delays the achievement of macroeconomic stability."
5,"Like the golfer with the unfamiliar putter, monetary policymakers are far from certain about the impact that a policy change of a given size will have on the economy, as already noted."
6,"During that cycle, the FOMC faced a worrisome trend of disinflation, a trend that if left unchecked might have brought the economy close to the zone of falling prices, or deflation."
7,"The FOMC had two options during that episode: gradual easing, which some observers advocated as a way of saving the remaining ""interest rate ammunition""; or a more preemptive approach, to try to nip in the bud any further decline of inflation toward the deflation boundary."
8,"Similar considerations presumably played a role during the 1994-95 tightening cycle, when concerns that inflation might rise significantly induced a relatively more rapid tightening."
9,"Indeed, interesting research by Ulf Söderström (2002) has shown that uncertainty about the persistence of inflation should induce more aggressive policies."
10,"For example, if policymakers are worried that inflation may be difficult to control once it is ""out of the bottle,"" so to speak, a more preemptive approach to controlling inflation may be justified."
11,"In practice, then, a desire on the part of policymakers to be conservative in the face of many different forms of uncertainty is probably an important reason for gradualism in monetary policy."
12,"Gradualism and the Determination of Long-term Interest Rates A rather different, but nevertheless complementary, argument for gradualism builds on the observation that private-sector expectations play a crucial role in the determination of long-term interest rates and other asset prices and yields."
13,"Informal discussions of monetary policy sometimes refer to the Fed as ""setting interest rates."""
14,"In fact, the FOMC does not set interest rates in general; rather, the Committee ""sets"" one specific interest rate, the federal funds rate.2 The federal funds rate, the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend to each other on a short-term basis (usually overnight) is not important in itself."
15,"From a macroeconomic perspective, longer-term interest rates--such as home mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and the rates on Treasury notes and bonds--are far more significant than the funds rate, because those rates are the most relevant to the spending and investment decisions made by households and businesses."
16,"Although the FOMC cannot directly determine long-term interest rates, it can exert significant influence over those rates through its control of current and future values of the federal funds rate."
17,The crucial link between the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates is the formation of private-sector expectations about future monetary policy actions.
18,"Loosely speaking, long-term interest rates embody the expectations of financial-market participants about the likely future path of short-term rates, which in turn are closely tied to expectations about the federal funds rate."
19,"Thus, to influence long-term interest rates, such as thirty-year mortgage rates or the yields on corporate bonds, the FOMC must influence private-sector expectations about future values of the federal funds rate."
20,What effect would that action likely have on mortgage rates and other longer-term interest rates that the Committee would like to influence?
21,"In this example, the FOMC's action would have essentially no effect on long-term interest rates."
22,"An interesting result, noted in an early paper by Marvin Goodfriend (1991) of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and developed more formally by my Princeton colleague Michael Woodford (2000, 2003), is that gradualist policies may allow the Fed to gain greater influence over long-term interest rates.3 The reason is the effect of past episodes of gradualist behavior on market expectations."
23,"Thus, gradualism helps to ensure that the FOMC will have an effective lever over economic activity and inflation."
24,"Less variable short-term rates reduce the risk that the policy rate will hit the zero lower bound on interest rates; they may also reduce stress in the financial system, as I will discuss shortly."
25,"A variant of the financial stability argument is that the Fed chooses to move interest rates gradually to minimize the risk of ""shocking"" the bond market."
26,"Large movements in long-term rates translate, of course, into wide swings in bond prices and thus potentially large capital gains and losses."
27,In my remarks today I have taken as self-evident that the FOMC conducts monetary policy by gradualist principles and have focused on reasons that gradualist policies may help to promote the Federal Reserve's objectives.
28,"The reason that monetary policy appears to adjust gradually, according to Rudebusch, is that the economy itself evolves slowly, which in turn leads policy to change slowly as well."
29,"In this scenario, observed interest rates would appear to be adjusting slowly, but in reality the apparent gradualism would reflect only the slow adjustment of the underlying economy that the Fed is trying to influence."
30,"However, recent studies that have taken up Rudebusch's challenge have generally found that both an intrinsically gradualist approach to policy and gradual changes in the underlying economic environment are needed to explain the historical patterns of U.S. monetary policy (English, Nelson, and Sack, 2003; Gerlach-Kristen, 2004)."
31,"Conclusion In my talk I discussed three sets of reasons for gradualist policies: policymaker uncertainty, improved control of long-term interest rates, and the reduction of financial stress."
32,I will close by briefly discussing some implications of the gradualist approach for current monetary policy.
33,"As you know, in reaction to gathering economic momentum and an apparent stabilization in inflation, the FOMC at its May 4 meeting characterized the risks to both sustainable growth and inflation as being roughly in balance."
34,"The Committee's statement ended with the following sentence: ""At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."""
35,"It is true that the inflation rate rose in the first quarter, a point to which I will return in a moment."
36,"As we look ahead, core inflation appears likely to remain in the zone of price stability during the remainder of 2004 and into 2005."
37,"Although slack utilization of resources, which moderates wage and price pressures, is an important reason that inflation is likely to remain subdued, my forecast of controlled inflation is based on more than output gap arguments."
38,"Other factors likely to keep inflation at modest levels include continuing rapid gains in productivity, which have kept growth of unit labor costs at a very low level; unusually high price-cost margins in industry, which provide scope for firms to absorb future cost increases without raising prices; globalization and intensified competition in product markets; and the recent strengthening of the dollar."
39,"There are also indications that commodity prices, with the important exception of energy prices, may be peaking."
40,"Long-term inflation expectations also appear well contained, although inflation expectations over shorter horizons have risen, perhaps partly in reaction to the rise in energy costs."
41,"Not everyone agrees with my relatively sanguine inflation forecast; indeed, some observers have questioned whether the current low level of the federal funds rate is not already excessively stimulative in light of the gathering recovery and the recent inflation data."
42,"First, I do agree that the flare-up in inflation in the first quarter is a matter for concern, and that the inflation data bear close watching."
43,"Should the rise in inflation show signs of persisting, I am confident that the Federal Open Market Committee will adjust policy as necessary to preserve price stability."
44,"Although I expect policy to follow the usual gradualist pattern, the pace of tightening will of necessity respond to evolving economic conditions, particularly the strength of the ongoing recovery in the labor market and developments on the inflation front."
45,"Second, however, concerns that that monetary policy is ""behind the curve"" may not fully take into account a point I made earlier, that the level of the federal funds rate by itself does not fully describe broad monetary conditions."
46,"In part because of the FOMC's communication strategy, which has linked future rate changes to the levels of inflation and resource utilization, and in part because of the gradualist policies that the FOMC has pursued in the past, markets have responded to recent data on payrolls, spending, and inflation by bringing forward a considerable amount of future policy tightening into current financial conditions."
47,"Notably, in the past few months, long-term interest rates have risen 100 basis points or more, equity markets have been subdued despite robust earnings reports, and the dollar has strengthened."
48,"These developments--the sort of ""front-loading"" of monetary tightening predicted by our analysis of gradualism--will reduce the financial impetus being provided to the economy and thus provide some check to nascent inflationary pressures."
