6,The combination of growing output and falling hours worked was made possible by a startlingly large rise in productivity.
7,The explanations of the past two years' surge in productivity are wide-ranging.
8,One hypothesis is that some of the increase represents a temporary rise in the level of productivity reflecting a view that an unusual amount of caution is leading businesses to press workers and facilities to a greater degree than can be sustained over the longer haul.
9,"By this hypothesis, as that caution dissipates, employment growth will pick up and the level of output per hour will drop back."
10,Another hypothesis is that the level of productivity has undergone a one-time permanent upward shift.
11,"But with tepid sales growth, uncertainty about the strength of future demand, and a fierce discipline exerted by financial markets, companies have been forced to search aggressively for ways to use resources more efficiently, to cut costs, and restore operating profit margins."

19,"In previous recessions since the 1960s, the underlying rate of inflation at economic troughs remained clearly above any level that could be associated with effective price stability."
20,"As a consequence, with some risk to economic activity, monetary policy typically had to move aggressively in the uncertain early stages of past economic recoveries to ensure that inflation would be contained."
21,"By contrast, in the current episode, core consumer price inflation as measured in the national income and product accounts has been running only a little more than 1 percent over the last year, and firms exhibit scant evidence that they are gaining appreciable pricing power despite the pickup in the pace of economic growth."
