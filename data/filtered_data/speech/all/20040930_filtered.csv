0,"First, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of the economic outlook and discuss in more detail how households and businesses appear poised for an expected rise in interest rates."
1,"After having moderated a bit in late spring, partly in response to a substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction."
2,"And with financial conditions still accommodative, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace for the remainder of the year."
3,"At the same time, it appears that inflation and inflation expectations have eased."
4,"The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, edged up only 0.1 percent in each of the past three months through August."
5,"This pace is substantially below the pace of earlier this year, when inflation was likely boosted by some transitory factors, such as the pass-through of large increases in energy and import prices, and some payback from the unusually modest increases in 2003."
6,"I expect underlying inflation to remain low, and, in my view, under these circumstances the Federal Reserve can remove its policy accommodation at a measured pace, consistent with its commitment to maintain price stability as a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth."
7,Some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years.
8,"But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the rapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices."
9,"Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years."
10,"Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these ""refis,"" often to pay down loans having higher interest rates."
11,"On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt."
12,"First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates."
13,"Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could be a good deal slower."
14,"Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have held their ground this year, reversing a good portion of the losses sustained over the previous three years."
15,"In addition, home prices have appreciated sharply since 1997."
16,"This improvement in financial conditions reflects a number of factors, namely low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities, and significant cost-cutting and productivity gains that boosted profitability."
17,"In my view, even with an expected rise in interest rates and some moderation in profit growth, the financial condition of the business sector should remain strong and able to support continued expansion."
18,"First, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy."
19,"Many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, a move that has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations by about 1 percentage point, on net, since the end of 2000."
20,"As a result, the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in the past two-and-a-half years was limited to its slowest pace since the early 1990s."
21,"These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term."
22,"Moreover, research by Board staff suggests that firms which are more likely to rely on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have tended to use derivatives in recent years to hedge their exposure to interest rate risk.1 Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and stretched out over time."
23,"In addition, a lesson we can take from the episode of policy tightening in 1994 is that rising interest rates have little detrimental effect on the financial health of the corporate sector when the rate increases occur in the context of an expanding economy."
24,"Specifically, corporate credit quality improved on balance after 1994 with the pickup in economic activity and corporate profits."
25,"Over the past few years, the drive to cut costs and boost efficiency has generated rapid productivity gains."
26,"Fuller utilization of the capabilities of capital already in place, ongoing improvements in inventory management, and streamlined production processes requiring fewer workers, to name but a few examples of efficiency enhancements, have boosted corporate profitability even when revenue growth was tepid."
27,"With the pick up in revenue growth in the second half of last year, companies were able to leverage the productivity gains and produce a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability."
28,"Moreover, because cyclical factors likely contributed to the recent dramatic advances in productivity, we should expect productivity gains to moderate."
29,"The improvements that businesses have made to their financial strength and profitability have been substantial and should help to support sustained, solid growth of the U.S. economy."
30,The guidance also permits sales for unexpected and significant changes in liquidity needs or increases in interest rates.
31,The significant growth in the credit derivative market is just one example.
32,The present value of the estimated future net cash flows attempts to anticipate consumer behavior to adjust for prepayments of mortgages due to forecasted interest rates.
33,"The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, as well as customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult."
34,"Certainly, a non-complex instrument that is highly liquid with an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument."
35,"Conclusion In summary, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace for the remainder of the year."
