5,"For many years, banks relied increasingly on short- to medium-term wholesale deposits (foreign time deposits and large dollar, or jumbo, certificates of deposit) to fund much of their asset growth."
6,"Since that time, the remarkable growth in MMDA and savings deposits suggests that the proportion of funds provided by wholesale deposits has fallen off considerably."

17,"Banks and thrifts then faced significant, and in some cases critical, interest rate risk exposures."
18,"Should interest rates return to levels of prior years, banks that rely on their savings accounts and MMDAs to fund long-term assets may be wise to consider the possibility of facing unexpected liquidity or interest rate risk pressures if depositors choose to shift deposit funds into other investment vehicles to enhance the return on their assets."
