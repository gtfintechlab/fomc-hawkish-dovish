0,Money also provides a metric for the measurement of prices.
1,"That is, once you have defined the unit of exchange, you can measure the price of any other item in terms of that unit."
2,Money is also obviously related to monetary policy.
3,"Another theme of the lecture is the relationship between the nature of money, the scope for changes in the overall level of prices, and constraints on or opportunities for discretionary monetary policy."
4,How would the spread of e-money affect financial stability and the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy?
5,"If so, what becomes of monetary policy, and how would the price level be determined?"
6,"The warehouses could therefore lend the gold--in turn, often converted into paper notes--holding a reserve of gold that allowed them to meet the normal demands for redemption."
7,"Sir Isaac Newton was master of the mint at the time and, according to Eichengreen, set too low a price for silver in terms of gold, inadvertently causing silver coins to mostly disappear from circulation."
8,"First, governments attached a high priority to currency and exchange rate stability."
9,"Second, central banks had to commit to buy and sell gold at that price."
10,"Third, gold could be freely coined, such coins represented a significant part of the money in circulation, and other forms of money were convertible into gold at a fixed price on demand."
11,"Most such issues of fiat money were followed by severe increases in prices, as governments tapped to an ever greater degree the easiest--in some cases perhaps the only--source of revenue."
12,These experiences highlight the importance of control of the money supply for achieving price stability.
13,"Money, Monetary Standards, and Monetary Policy The nature of money determines some important properties of the economy, including the scope for changes in the overall price level and the opportunity for discretionary monetary policy -- that is, for control of the money supply in an effort to improve economic performance."
14,"The basic relationship between money and prices is often described in terms of the ""quantity theory of money."""
15,"In the long run, according to this proposition, the price level moves proportionately to the money supply."
16,"As a result, the rate of inflation depends on the rate of money growth."
17,"Though this proposition holds precisely only under restrictive conditions, it identifies in a more general sense an essential link between money and prices."
18,"It is therefore useful in understanding the way changes in the nature of money might affect the determination of the price level.5 Under commodity money systems, money is often privately produced, and the price level of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money depends on the supply of commodity money relative to the supplies of the non-money commodities."
19,"In a sense, there is no absolute price level of goods in such an economy, only a set of relative prices."
20,"However, the relative prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money become, in effect, a measure of money prices, as we would think of that term today."
21,"Prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money need not be constant, but there is no opportunity for discretionary monetary policy."
22,"Debasement of the currency typically resulted in inflation--a rise in the price of non-money goods in proportion to the debased currency, which, in effect, maintained the underlying relationship between the commodity, gold or silver, and the price of other goods."
23,These are the first experiences with significant inflation induced by government's manipulation of money.
24,"As long as the relationship between the commodity money and the amount of paper money backed by the commodity money is stable, inflation will be determined by the available supply of commodity money."
25,"But the beginning of modern banking, by breaking the strict link between the commodity money and the money supply, added an element of flexibility to the money supply and further opened up the possibility for inflation."
26,"This situation did not guarantee a stable price level, but it did remove the risk of government-induced inflation."
27,"The gold standard, in effect, put in place a rule that governed monetary policy.6 If a country ran a trade deficit that exceeded private capital inflows, it would, in principle, finance the difference by shipping gold to other countries."
28,"Doing so reduced the money supply--and hence income and prices--in the country with the balance of payments deficit and increased the money supplies, incomes, and prices in the countries with balance of payments surpluses."
29,"As a result, the system had a built-in tendency to move the deficit and surplus countries toward balance."
30,"The effect on income and prices was, in this case, not due directly to changes in the gold supply, but to the changes in interest rates that were implemented to limit the drain on gold."
31,"conveys a sense of automaticity and stability--a self-correcting mechanism with minimum human intervention, which ensures rough stability of prices and balance in international payments."
32,"Cooper notes that economic growth during the late nineteenth century was respectable, but variability in income growth was substantially greater under the gold standard than during the period after World War II.7 But the gold standard was predominantly about price stability, so here we might give special weight to evidence pertaining to that characteristic."
33,Cooper notes that short-run variations in wholesale prices were greater during the pre-war gold standard than during the period from 1949 to 1979.
34,"In assessing economic performance under the gold standard, one must also look at possible trends in prices."
35,"If one compares 1877 and 1913, for example, the price level is essentially unchanged."
36,But the period covers a sharp and extended decline in the price level followed by an equally sharp and persistent increase.
37,"Prices from 1873 to 1896, for example, decreased 53 percent; this decrease was followed by an increase of 56 percent from 1896 to 1913."
38,"In the early post-World War II period, nations sought an alternative to the international gold standard to govern exchange rates and international economic relations."
39,"At a conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, participating governments agreed to maintain a fixed exchange rate system--more precisely, an adjustable peg."
40,"Exchange rates were mostly stable but could be altered in discrete amounts, under prescribed circumstances--allowing deviation from a fully rules-based system to one with more discretion."
41,"In practice, the system was implemented by the commitment of the United States to maintain a fixed relation between its currency and gold and other countries' agreement to fix their exchange rates relative to the dollar, at rates agreed to at the conference."
42,Fixed exchange rate systems provide a degree of constraint on domestic monetary policies.
43,"Most countries, given limits on their international reserves, had to follow policies consistent with supporting their fixed exchange rates--though, as noted above, they had the option of changing the exchange rate."
44,"As long as the United States was prepared to convert dollars into gold, at a fixed exchange rate for official purposes, other countries seemed willing to hold dollars."
45,"When the United States broke the link to gold in 1971, other major countries no longer were willing to accept dollars at the fixed exchange rate."
46,"The adjustable peg system broke down, and the world ended up, de facto, in a regime of floating exchange rates, with exchange rates determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market."
47,The combination of fiat money systems and floating exchange rates removed the earlier constraints on domestic monetary policies for other countries and made price stability and other dimensions of domestic economic performance dependent on the conduct of their domestic monetary policies.
48,"Central banks had to learn how to exercise that discretion in support of the objectives usually dictated by their legislatures, almost always including price stability and, in the case of the United States, price stability and full employment.8 There have been disappointments as well as successes with monetary policy around the world."
49,"Over time, the number of independent central banks has increased significantly, and independence no doubt enhances the ability of central banks to achieve price stability."
50,"There has also been an advance in our understanding of how to conduct monetary policy to achieve stable rates of inflation, at least on average over a period of years, and perhaps also to contribute, at the same time, to smoothing output and employment growth."
51,"Over the last ten to fifteen years, coinciding with both an increased emphasis on the price stability objective and the advances in our understanding about the conduct of policy, inflation performance has been very good."
52,"However, some countries today continue to impose constraints on discretionary monetary policy through fixed exchange rate regimes, tying their inflation rates to inflation in the country to which their exchange rate is pegged."
53,"This system does not eliminate the influence of discretion, but it makes inflation in one country dependent on the discretionary monetary policy in some other country."
54,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit."
55,"E-money and Financial Stability The spread of e-money could have significant implications for the size of central bank balance sheets, for depository institutions (depending on which are allowed to provide network money), for financial stability, and possibly for the implementation of monetary policy."
56,"E-money and Monetary Policy To appreciate the implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy, it will be helpful to understand the concept of the monetary base (B)."
57,Monetary policy is implemented through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) setting a target for the federal funds rate.
58,The federal funds rate is determined by the supply and demand for such reserves.
59,"The implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy would arise from the substitution of e-money for both currency and deposits, shrinking the size of the monetary base."
60,"Taken by itself, the decline in the demand for currency would have no direct implications for the conduct of monetary policy because what matters for monetary policy is the supply of and demand for reserves.11 A decline in the demand for currency would, however, lower the monetary base and hence reduce the size of the Fed's portfolio of securities."
61,"To the extent that the demand for currency declines, the monetary base and hence the Fed's portfolio would shrink, and the interest earnings on that portfolio would diminish."
62,"The Fed uses the interest earnings, along with revenue from fees for check clearing, Fedwire, and other priced services, to cover the cost of its operations."
63,More interesting is the possibility that the spread of network e-money might dramatically reduce the demand for deposits and hence correspondingly reduce the amount of bank reserves.
64,"In that case, the spread of e-money would not significantly reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy."
65,"In this case, reserves would decline, so we would need to analyze the implications of such a decline for the conduct of monetary policy."
66,"Fortunately, we already have some experience with earlier innovations that have reduced the demand for reserves."
67,The Fed has worried that this decline in the level of required reserve balances could result in increased volatility of the funds rate and require the Fed to alter the way it conducts monetary policy.
68,"But without the cushion provided by required reserves, the intraday and interday fluctuations in the demand for reserves could increase the volatility of the federal funds rate."
69,"In the absence of such new statutory authority, the Fed has indicated it might need to alter the way it implements monetary policy, in the event that required reserve balances fell further and the volatility of the funds rate increased."
70,The same system could be implemented if the spread of e-money reduced the demand for transactions balances and hence the level of required reserves.
71,"Such a system is common, indeed almost the norm for other central banks, in the conduct of monetary policy."
72,"Several countries have eliminated required reserves, and we appreciate today that reserve requirements are not essential for the conduct of monetary policy.14 In any case, under these assumptions, there would be no demand for required reserve balances at the central bank."
73,"Nevertheless, if trust in e-money instruments were not complete, holders would presumably demand that e-money be exchangeable for notes and coin at par."
74,"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy."
75,"The resulting demand for the monetary base would allow the Fed to set the federal funds rate (by setting the supply of reserves, or by setting the terms on deposit and borrowing facilities)."
76,"If trust in the private provider or providers were complete, and nobody ever doubted their ability to convert stored-value or network money into dollars, then demand for the monetary base could fall to zero."
77,But providers of stored-value cards and network money would still need funds to meet demands as holders of the e-money use it to buy goods and services.
78,"In this case, once again, there does not appear to be a problem for monetary policy."
79,"This hypothetical situation--perhaps one more interesting as an intellectual challenge than as a plausible outcome--forces us to try to understand what the minimum requirements are for an effective monetary policy, defined as one that can maintain control of some short-term interest rate."
80,He convincingly argues that monetary policy could still maintain control over interest rates--provided that the central bank can pay interest on the deposit balances it offers.
81,The central bank can conduct monetary policy in this case by setting an interest rate on balances held at the central bank.
82,"The minimum requirement for an effective monetary policy is, therefore, the ability of the central bank to set an interest rate on balances held by banks with the central bank."
83,Woodford does not address the possibility that banks might not have a positive demand for central bank balances.
84,"Even in this case, the availability of central bank balances and credit at an interest rate set by the central bank would, in my view, effectively control the interest rate on interbank deposits and therefore continue to allow the central bank to conduct monetary policy."
85,"Therefore, the spread of e-money is unlikely to reduce the demand for reserve balances at the central bank to such an extent that the central bank could not conduct monetary policy by controlling an overnight interest rate."
86,"In this case, a system of floors and ceilings, as described above, complemented by open market operations, should ensure the continued effectiveness of monetary policy."
87,"The result, in any of these very speculative cases, would clearly be that the factors shaping monetary policy and the determination of the price level would be greatly changed."
88,"Still, if a private bank were somehow able to establish its currency as a fiat currency (that is, without making it convertible into Fed dollars or some other asset), then its monetary policy over time would determine the value of its currency, interest rates on its currency and its inflation rate."
89,"If competing banks provided their own currencies, there would be multiple price levels, depending on the currency, and a number of cross exchange rates."
90,"Though technology may reduce the costs of handling multiple currencies and prices, we are not at the point where the costs of doing so are negligible."
91,"In that case, the price level in each currency would reflect the relative price of the commodity chosen by the respective issuer."
92,"In that case, the overall price level would be the result of the monetary policy chosen by the firm running the private central bank."
93,It is not clear that a private monopoly central bank has the incentives to produce good monetary policy.
94,"Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses)."
95,"If the private central bank were to adopt a commodity standard, then its actions would be constrained and might lead to stable prices over the longer term, subject to all the limitations of the gold standard discussed earlier."
96,"The spread of computers, advances in telecommunications, and the dramatic growth in the use of the Internet point to innovations in e-money."
97,"These will ultimately reshape the payment system and, along the way, present challenges to the Federal Reserve and monetary policy."
98,"The spread of network money, on the other hand, might not reduce the demand for reserves, if network money is subject to reserve requirements."
99,"In this case, a system featuring floors and ceilings appears well designed to allow the Fed to continue to implement monetary policy by controlling the federal funds rate."
100,"For example, from 1979 to 2000, while the number of checks written per year increased by 53 percent (or a 2½ percent compound annual growth rate), electronic payments increased by 500 percent (or an 8 percent compound annual growth rate)."

114,"Return to text 11.Today, open market operations are carried out partly to neutralize the effect of swings in currency demand on the level of reserves."
115,"In the absence of such offsetting operations, a decrease in currency demand would raise the amount of reserves and hence lower the federal funds rate."
116,"For example, if the demand for currency declined as a result of the spread of stored value cards, and there were no offsetting open market operations, reserves would increase as banks converted currency into deposits."
117,"Specifically, if the Fed were allowed to offer interest on reserve balances, the demand for voluntary reserve balances to facilitate settlements across banks could rise."
