0,Increased demand and lagging additions to productive capacity have combined to absorb a significant amount of the slack in energy markets that was essential in containing energy prices between 1985 and 2000.
1,"Although the recent price of light sweet crude oil is only a bit above the highs of last October, overall market prices of recent weeks, in fact, have been much more elevated."
2,"The prices of heavier, sour grades, which make up a significant part of the world production mix, are notably higher than in October."
3,"Dubai crude for instance, at yesterday's close, sold for more than $12 per barrel above its October price level."
4,"Moreover, although the price of six-year futures for light sweet crude did not match the overall run-up of oil prices last fall, in recent weeks it has largely kept pace with spot prices, leading to record levels for contracts maturing in 2011."
5,"Reflecting a low short-term elasticity of demand, higher prices in recent months have slowed the growth of oil demand, but only modestly."
6,"The slowdown in the growth of demand coupled with expanded production, which the price firmness has induced, has required markets to absorb an increased pace of inventory investment."
7,The markets' response has been a shift in the spread between spot prices and near-term futures that has facilitated inventory hedging.
8,Futures prices for delivery of both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crudes for the summer exceed spot prices.
9,"If sustained, these market technicals could encourage enough of an inventory buffer to damp the current price frenzy."
10,"Natural gas prices, seasonally adjusted, have not returned to their peak of last October, but remain significantly above the levels at year-end 2004."
11,"Working levels of gas inventories are seasonally moderate, but domestic dry gas production plus net imports has not expanded sufficiently over the past few years to prevent a marked rise in price."
12,"The inexorable rise in residential and utility use has priced the more marginal industrial gas users partially out of the market and has induced significant gains in gas efficiency among a number of gas users such as petroleum refineries, steel mills, and paper and board mills."
13,Much will depend on the response of demand to price over the longer run.
14,Prices of spot crude oil and natural gas have risen sharply over the past year in the face of constrained supply and the firming of overall demand.
15,"But if history is any guide, should higher prices persist, energy use will over time continue to decline, relative to GDP.1 Long-term demand elasticities have proved noticeably higher than those that are evident short term."
16,"For years, long-term prospects for oil and gas prices appeared benign."
17,"When choosing capital projects, businesses in the past could mostly look through short-run fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices to moderate prices over the longer haul."
18,"*** Aside from uncertain demand, the resolution of current major geopolitical uncertainties will materially affect oil prices in the years ahead."
19,"Unless those policies are changed, a greater proportion of the cash flow of producing countries will be needed for oil reinvestment if capacity is to keep up with projected world demand."
20,Concerns about potential shortfalls in investment certainly have contributed to current record-high long-term futures prices.
21,"But investment to convert reserves to productive capacity has fallen short of the levels required to match unexpected recent gains in demand, especially gains in China."
22,"*** U.S. natural gas prices have historically displayed greater volatility than prices of crude oil, doubtless reflecting, in part, the less-advanced development of price-damping global trade in natural gas."
23,Significant pressure on prices ensued.
24,"Because international trade in natural gas has been insufficient to equalize prices across markets, U.S. natural gas prices since late 2002 have been notably higher, on average, than prices abroad, thereby putting significant segments of the North American gas-using industry in a weakened competitive position."
25,The difficulties associated with inadequate domestic supplies will eventually be resolved as consumers and producers react to the signals provided by market prices.
26,This activity has accelerated sharply over the past few years as profitable arbitrage has emerged in natural gas prices across international markets.
27,"Clearly, the gas trade has significant margin to exercise its price-damping opportunities."
28,"The larger question, of course, is what will increased world trade in LNG and expanded U.S. import capacity do to currently uncompetitive natural gas prices in the United States?"
29,"During the past couple of years, when U.S. prices of natural gas hovered around $6 million Btu, import prices of LNG in Europe have ranged between $2 and $4 per million Btu, and those in Japan and Korea have generally been between $3 and $5 per million Btu."
30,"In the short run, exporters to the United States are likely to receive our domestic price, currently above $7 per million Btu."
31,"But unless world gas markets tighten aggressively, competitive pressures will arbitrage the U.S. natural gas price down, possibly significantly, through increased imports."
32,"But because of inexorably rising demand, these improved technologies have been unable to prevent the underlying long-term prices of oil and natural gas in the United States from rising."
33,But at current market prices they have become competitive.
34,"According to projections from the Energy Information Administration, the majority of the growth in the domestic supply of natural gas over the next twenty years will come from unconventional sources."
35,"As the manner in which energy is produced and consumed evolves, it is not unreasonable to expect that, in the long run, the prices per unit of energy from various sources would tend to converge."
36,"At present, long-term futures prices for natural gas are, on a Btu-equivalent basis, notably less expensive than those for crude oil."
37,"In addition, given the concerns over the long-term adequacy of liquid production capacity from conventional oil reserves, GTL may provide an attractive, competitively priced, option for making use of stranded gas, which, for lack of access to transportation infrastructure, cannot be brought to market."
