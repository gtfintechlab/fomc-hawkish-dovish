0,"I hope that you will conclude from this discussion that, though the process of setting monetary policy is complex, it is nonetheless in many important ways accessible to the average citizen."
1,"The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the most important monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy."
3,"Generally, an announcement of a change in interest rates, if any, is made at about 2:15 in the afternoon."
4,Let me shift now from the mechanics of the process to the broader conceptual issues that confront the conduct of monetary policy and some of the issues surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy.
5,The Goals of Monetary Policy Federal law establishes the goals of monetary policy.
6,"The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
7,"Many analysts believe that achieving price stability should be the primary goal of a central bank because a stable level of prices appears to be the condition most conducive to maximum sustained output and employment, and to moderate long-term interest rates."
8,"This presumably is because in times of price stability the prices of goods, materials and services are undistorted by inflation and thus can serve as clearer signals and guides for the efficient allocation of resources."
9,"Also, a background of stable prices is thought to encourage capital formation because it reduces the distortion created by a tax system that is only partly indexed for inflation."
10,Some would argue that the remarkable period of growth that we are experiencing is due in no small measure to the low rate of inflation that has prevailed for some time.
11,"In the long run, I have no doubt that price stability underpins efforts to achieve maximum output and employment."
12,"But, in the short run, some tensions can arise between efforts to reduce inflation and efforts to maximize employment and output."
13,"For example, the economy may at times be faced with adverse developments affecting supply, such as a bad agricultural harvest or a disruption in the supply of oil, which put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on output and employment."
14,"In these circumstances, makers of monetary policy must decide the extent to which we should focus on defusing price pressures or on cushioning the loss of output and employment in the short run, while still keeping an eye on our long-term objectives."
15,"At other times, policymakers may be concerned that expectations of inflation will get built into decisions about wages and prices and, become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
16,Countering this threat of inflation with a more restrictive monetary policy could risk small losses of output and employment in the short run but might make it possible to avoid larger losses later should expectations of higher inflation become embedded in the economy.
17,"These labels are an effort to simplify, in fact oversimplify, the complex choices that each member of the FOMC must make in deciding how to trade off the risk that action, or inaction, on our part will lead to inflation heating up to unacceptable levels, against the risk of having inadequate creation of jobs."
18,"But I believe that all members of the Committee recognize that, over the longer haul, the major contribution the Federal Reserve can make to higher standards of living is to promote price stability."
19,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets."
20,"Because of the long time-frame in which the effects on the real economy are realized, I believe that it is important for policy to look ahead as it aims at promoting stable prices and a sustainable GDP growth path, along which the economy is at full potential."
21,"Given that we need to be forward-looking, or ""preemptive,"" as it is often put, one potentially important element in making monetary policy is the forecast or likely outlook for economic growth, unemployment and the price level for the next year or two."
22,"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts."
23,"To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable."
24,"As one example, the failure of price inflation to pick up, as labor markets have become tighter is not consistent with the simple correlations that were so apparent in earlier cycles."
25,"Moreover, factors outside of economists' models have provided some surprises, such as the Asian economic and financial turmoil and the gyration of oil prices."
26,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed."
27,"Some of the variables relevant in this regard are: 1) the rate of change in wages or prices or early signs of emerging inflation, 2) the level of the unemployment rate and the pace of job creation, 3) the rate and composition of GDP growth (inventories, trade flows, consumption, investment, residential and commercial construction, and so forth), and 4) international developments."
28,"Another set of variables to be considered in making monetary policy are financial variables, such as the money supply, interest rates, exchange rates, credit flows, and conditions in bank lending and in the debt and equity markets."
29,"The last two years, 1997 and 1998, gave an interesting case study of the interplay between these different variables and the degree of forward-looking behavior in the making of monetary policy."
30,"From March of 1997 through much of 1998, pleasant surprises in the performance of inflation and the general absence of early signs of inflation, and uncertainty about the relationship of changes in inflation to the level of resource utilization, kept the FOMC from tightening."
31,We did not tighten despite the economy being beyond most estimates of its potential and despite many forecasts of rising inflation.
32,"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so."
33,"Indeed, monetary policy was eased in the fall of 1998."
34,"Under those circumstances, the FOMC thought it appropriate to ease policy to offset a likely significant impact on future domestic spending and growth."
35,"Finally, no discussion of monetary policy and financial markets would be complete without reference to the equity markets."
36,"Therefore, equity prices have an influence on business fixed investment, along with household consumption."
37,We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that impair real economic activity.
38,These are just some of the factors that go into making monetary policy.
39,"Outlook for 1999 With this general statement of the factors that go into setting monetary policy, let me turn to the outlook for 1999."
40,"Real GDP grew more than 4 percent in 1998, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, and maintained that rapid growth into the first quarter of this year."
41,"The consensus, as represented by the most recent Blue Chip Economic Indicators, is that growth will be more moderate over the remainder of 1999, but that it will still total nearly 3-1/4 percent or so for the year."
42,"The ability of Brazil, with the financial assistance of the international community, to weather its exchange rate crisis as well as it has to date, no doubt, has done much to allay some of the fears that were present in late 1998 and early 1999."
43,"Finally, it is simply the case that many economists have come to the realization that they underestimated the underlying strength of domestic demand here in the United States-and the profitability of American businesses in that environment."
44,"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year."
45,"That rise, through the effects I noted earlier, should continue to support domestic demand in the months ahead."
46,"But, again underscoring an earlier point, this tightness of the labor market has not manifested itself in ongoing escalation of wage inflation."
47,"Second, and more fundamentally, it is quite possible that we are seeing a pass-through of the more modest rates of price inflation we have enjoyed in the past couple of years into decisions about nominal wage increases."
48,"This is, of course, a very healthy development-one that we hope will be sustained going forward, because it is central to the achievement of ongoing price stability."
49,We must recognize that there have been a number of factors behind the favorable price performance we have been experiencing.
50,"In part, it is due to an increase in productivity, as businesses have invested in high-tech equipment and adjusted the procedures of the workplace to get the greatest benefit from those investments."
51,"This allows workers to become more productive and receive higher pay, which businesses need not translate into higher prices in order to remain profitable."
52,"Moreover, we have already seen some reversal of some of these factors, most notably the sharp rebound in world oil prices and a surge in health insurance costs."
53,"Under the circumstances, we must be concerned that, with the economy operating at such a high level of labor utilization and growth robust, we might be in some jeopardy of setting the stage for a an upturn in inflation."
54,"In our announcement after our May 18 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee made it clear that we are watching things very closely and stand prepared to act promptly if the evidence begins to mount that inflationary pressures could be building."
55,We observe developments in the economy and in financial markets and try to adjust monetary policy to the signals that we receive so that our nation's economic welfare is not threatened by inflation or by growth that persistently falls below the economy's potential.
