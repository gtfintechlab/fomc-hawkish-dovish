0,"Beyond the basic rationales of democratic accountability and engagement with the public, however, open and clear communication by the policy committee--which in practice includes speeches and congressional testimony by FOMC members, as well as official statements--makes monetary policy more effective in at least three distinct ways."
1,"Second, in the long run, communicating the central bank's objectives and policy strategies can help to anchor the public's long-term expectations--most importantly, its expectations of inflation."
2,Public confidence that inflation will remain low in the long run has numerous benefits.
3,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low."
4,"At the same time, by reducing the risk that inflation will come loose from its moorings, well-anchored inflation expectations may afford the central bank more short-term flexibility to respond to economic disturbances that affect output and employment."
5,The third way in which clear and open communication enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy--the channel that will be the focus of my remarks today--is by helping to align financial-market participants' expectations about the future course of monetary policy more closely with the policy committee's own plans and projections.
6,"As I will discuss, to the extent that central bank talk provides useful guidance to markets about the likely future path of short-term interest rates, policymakers will exert greater influence over the longer-term interest rates that most matter for spending decisions."
7,Both of these factors enhance the effectiveness and precision of monetary policy.
8,"Communication and the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Although people often speak of the Federal Reserve as controlling interest rates, in fact the Fed directly affects only one very short-term and (in the scheme of things) relatively unimportant interest rate, the federal funds rate."
9,"As you may know, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which commercial banks lend each other reserves for short periods, usually overnight."
10,"In particular, most private-sector borrowing and investment decisions depend not on the funds rate but on longer-term yields, such as mortgage rates and corporate bond rates, and on the prices of long-lived assets, such as housing and equities."
11,"Moreover, the link between these longer-term yields and asset prices and the current setting of the federal funds rate can be quite loose at times."
12,"This June, concerns about inflation, together with a general belief that economic growth would continue to be strong, led bond traders to anticipate that the Fed would tighten policy relatively quickly."
13,"Because the funds rate was expected to rise at a comparatively rapid pace, longer-term yields were well above short-term rates; in other words, the term structure of interest rates sloped steeply upward."
14,"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects."
15,"Because of these changes in their outlook, market participants now expect the FOMC to proceed more slowly in its tightening than they did in June.1 Moreover, with inflation now expected to remain low, market participants may anticipate a lower short-term interest rate to prevail in the long run."
16,"To assess whether monetary policy is providing net stimulus or restraint to spending and the economy, one needs to know not only the current value of the funds rate but also the expected future path of the funds rate, as priced in financial markets."
17,"Without guidance from the central bank, market participants can do no better than form expectations based on the average past behavior of monetary policymakers, a strategy that may be adequate under some or even most circumstances but may be seriously misguided in others."
18,"In contrast, when the monetary policy committee regularly provides information about its objectives, economic outlook, and policy plans, two benefits result."
19,"First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently."
20,"In their current form, they provide a brief description of the state of the economy and a somewhat formulaic description of the so-called balance of risks with respect to the outlook for output growth and inflation."
21,"The balance-of-risks portion of the statement also provides information about the likely course of policy, but it does so more indirectly by describing the Committee's assessment of the potential risks to its dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability rather than by commenting on the policy rate itself."
22,"At the time that ""considerable period"" was introduced, the market was pricing in a significant degree of near-term policy tightening, presumably on the expectation that the sharp pickup in growth in the third quarter of 2003 would induce the FOMC to raise rates."
23,"However, this market reaction placed insufficient weight, I believe, on the fact that the expansion that began in mid-2003 was characterized by exceptional gains in labor productivity, which implied in turn that the rapid growth in output did not materially increase the pressure on resources."
24,"With inflation low and with continuing slack in resource utilization, the rapid tightening projected by the markets did not appear justified, the surge in output growth notwithstanding."
25,"Crucially, this change in expectations resulted in lower interest rates at all maturities, a development that helped support the expansion in the latter part of last year."
26,"When the policy tightening cycle finally began earlier this year, the FOMC indicated that, with underlying inflation still relatively low, it would proceed ""at a pace that is likely to be measured."""
27,"In particular, the Committee noted that it would respond as necessary to maintain price stability."
28,"Indeed, if the central bank's statements are not informative about the likely future course of the short-term interest rate, they will soon lose their ability to influence market expectations."
29,"Some Evidence In my remarks thus far I have argued in general terms that FOMC communication can help inform the public's expectations of the future course of short-term interest rates, providing the Committee with increased influence over longer-term rates and hence a greater ability to achieve its macroeconomic objectives."
30,"With two Federal Reserve colleagues, Vincent Reinhart and Brian Sack, I recently developed new empirical evidence on these questions, some highlights of which I will briefly share with you today (Bernanke, Reinhart, and Sack, 2004).3 The effects of FOMC actions and statements are reflected most clearly and directly in financial markets; so to try to measure these effects my coauthors and I studied the responses to FOMC decisions of some key interest rates and asset prices."
31,"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy."
32,"In our work we focused on a particular futures contract (a Eurodollar futures contract), which provides a good measure of what the market expects the federal funds rate to be at a horizon of about one year.5 By observing the change in the price of that contract in the period around each FOMC decision, we were able to infer how that decision affected year-ahead policy expectations."
