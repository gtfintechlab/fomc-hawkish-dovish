0,"Similarly, financial market participants quickly assimilate publicly available information to help judge the market clearing price for securities that you issue."
1,"The Federal Reserve, too, relies on multiple sources of data to help achieve our dual mandate: ensuring price stability and achieving maximum employment."
2,Some of the data upon which we draw--statistical indicators of activity and prices in the real economy--tend to be backward-looking and subject to considerable revision.
3,"Other information we use is drawn from financial market prices; although subject to rapid change and ""noisy"" market signals, this information can be considerably more timely and forward looking."
4,"In its role as a bank regulator and supervisor, the Federal Reserve also often looks to market prices to help assess the safety and soundness of financial institutions."
5,"First, financial markets can inform and, in some cases, complement the actions of the Federal Reserve by providing timely information about the outlook for economic activity, inflation, and the health of individual financial institutions."
6,"Second, the Federal Reserve confronts many challenges when trying to extract relevant information from financial market prices--not least because these prices reflect the market's interpretation of our outlook as well as its independent assessments."
7,"I will begin with a discussion of how markets, in my judgment, inform the monetary policy process, and then turn to the role of markets in the supervisory and regulatory process."
8,Financial Markets and Monetary PolicyMarkets affect monetary policy predominantly through the information provided by asset prices.
9,"The available menu of prices is extensive, including those of Treasury securities (nominal and real), corporate debt, equities, and derivatives."
10,"These prices embed investors' expectations of the future paths of economic growth, inflation, and financial conditions."
11,"At least as important, these prices also can provide some insight into the uncertainty surrounding likely outcomes."
12,Monetary policy makers can use economic models and statistical techniques to extract the views of market participants about these key macroeconomic variables.
13,Let me cite a few simple examples of how we interpret asset prices.
14,"Interest rates for periods extending beyond that very short horizon, however, are established by market participants rather than the FOMC, although members of the Committee may be able to influence these longer-term rates somewhat through what is affectionately described as ""open mouth operations."""
15,"In this way, market-based interest rates reflect primarily the path investors expect for monetary policy."
16,Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are financial market assets that provide a judgment on forward-looking views about inflation.
17,The gap between nominal Treasury yields and yields on TIPS of comparable maturities is called the breakeven inflation rate.
18,The breakeven rate incorporates the market's expectation of inflation and the risk premium for uncertainty about these expectations.
19,"Today, breakeven rates implied by forward prices on TIPS indicate longer-run consumer price index inflation compensation of about 2-1/2 percent, in the middle of the range of the past several years."
20,"This is an example of information that may provide monetary policy makers with a reasonable source of market insight and may importantly complement an inflation outlook developed from economic models, survey responses, and other sources."
21,Properly measuring inflation expectations is critically important to the Fed in its formulation of policy.
22,"In addition to providing expected interest rates and inflation rates, equity prices incorporate investors' views about the growth of corporate earnings."
23,Corporate bond prices embed expected default and recovery risks.
24,"Moreover, derivatives prices can provide other valuable information, and we can learn much by understanding the linkages between primary and derivatives markets."
25,Let me underscore the role of market signals by discussing monetary policy in the current economic environment.
26,Recent aggregate data indicate that overall economic activity slowed noticeably during the first nine months of the year.
27,"But as housing markets stabilize, I would expect overall economic performance to strengthen from the levels indicated by preliminary estimates of gross domestic product in the third quarter to a pace more consistent with the economy's long-term trend growth rate."
28,"Inflation, though down somewhat from its level earlier this year, remains uncomfortably elevated."
29,Financial market prices imply that inflation will continue its gradual but persistent downward track during the forecast period.
30,"There remain, I believe, clear upside risks to that inflation outlook."
31,"Prices on federal funds futures and Eurodollar futures suggest that market participants expect the FOMC to cut the target federal funds rate about 50 basis points during 2007, a view consistent with expectations of a ""soft landing."""
32,"At the same time, market-based options prices on these interest rate futures indicate that implied volatilities are quite low, suggesting a surprising degree of certainty regarding policy expectations."
33,"Taken at face value, market participants appear to be reasonably certain of a benign outcome for both economic growth and inflation."
34,"I am a strong advocate of incorporating forward-looking information from asset prices into the Fed's decision process, but we should not take market readings as determinative of policy."
35,Why can't market prices be more assuredly relied upon?
36,"Asset prices contain term premiums, credit risk premiums, and liquidity premiums that vary over time and are themselves related to market expectations and uncertainty."
37,"Consequently, it can be difficult to determine whether movements in asset prices reflect a change in expectations, in uncertainty, or in some combination of premiums."
38,"If these changes reflect increased strength in underlying demand for longer-term Treasury securities, including from emerging economies, the decline should be reflected in a decline in term premiums."
39,"In such a case, all else equal, a tighter monetary policy might be preferred."
40,"On the other hand, if the decline reflects investors' views of a weaker path for the economy--the more typical interpretation of a flat or inverted yield curve--policymakers might prefer a more accommodative monetary policy."
