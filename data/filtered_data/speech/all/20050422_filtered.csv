0,"I thought it might be useful for me to close the conference by giving you my perspective on some of the imbalances currently evident in the U.S. and global economies, how they might be resolved, and their implications for policy--including monetary policy."
1,"Real gross domestic product growth has rebounded smartly from the 2001 recession, and slack both in labor and product markets has eroded appreciably."
2,"After a substantial period of little or no increase in employment, payroll gains have picked up to an average of 160,000 per month over the past half year, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5-1/4 percent, almost 1 percentage point below where it was two years ago."
3,"The increase in output has been accompanied by large increases in labor productivity that, since 2002, have been in excess of even the elevated pace of the second half of the 1990s."
4,"To be sure, the rise in energy prices seems to have taken a toll on consumer confidence and spending most recently."
5,"But with financial conditions still accommodative, profits and cash flow still healthy, and incomes continuing to increase, most forecasters expect growth to remain solid."
6,"Excluding food and energy, the rate of inflation has fluctuated around 1-1/2 percent over the past few years, measured by the chain-weighted price index for personal consumption expenditures."
7,"Core inflation has been running somewhat faster more recently, in part because of the increases in the prices of energy, commodities, and imports that began last year."
8,"Nevertheless, barring further sizable increases in the prices of oil and natural gas, both core and headline inflation rates should moderate later this year."
9,"Buttressing this view, long-run inflation expectations have been, on balance, fairly stable in the face of these price gyrations."
10,"In particular, beneath this placid surface are what appear to be a number of spending imbalances and unusual asset-price configurations."
11,"This imbalance, measured by the current account deficit, has risen to a record level, both in absolute terms and as a ratio to GDP."
12,"Moreover, the cumulative value of past current account deficits--the net foreign indebtedness of the United States--is also at a record high, again both in absolute terms and as a ratio to GDP."
13,The growing current account deficit has been associated with a pronounced decline in the saving proclivities of both the private and public sectors.
14,"In the public sector, the federal-budget deficit has been larger in the past, at least relative to the size of GDP, but the deterioration in the balance over recent years has been sizable, moving from a surplus of $236 billion in fiscal year 2000 to a deficit of more than $400 billion last year."
15,"One might have thought that, with probably limited economic slack remaining, such a pronounced imbalance between national saving and domestic investment would have placed substantial upward pressure on interest rates."
16,One also might have expected real interest rates to be high at a time when we are experiencing rapid productivity growth.
17,"Low interest rates have, in turn, been a major force driving the phenomenal run-up in residential real estate prices over the past few years, and the resultant boost to net worth must be one of the reasons households have felt comfortable directing so little of their current income to saving."
18,"However, whether low interest rates and other fundamental factors can fully explain the current lofty level of housing prices is the subject of substantial debate."
19,Can the aforementioned spending imbalances and possible asset-price anomalies continue without threatening macroeconomic stability?
20,"Will the transition be relatively benign, or will it be a rocky adjustment with deleterious effects on economic growth, inflation, and other factors?"
21,"The trade account has been persistently in deficit since the late 1970s, and the current account has been in a similar state almost continuously since the early 1980s."
22,"So these imbalances have been around for a long time, and our economy is still churning out high rates of productivity and income growth."
23,I have already noted the unprecedented level of the current account deficit and the depressed household saving rate.
24,"The increased desire to hold dollar assets resulted in part from the jump in the rate of increase in productivity that materialized in the United States in the mid- to late-1990s and that, in turn, raised the perceived rate of return on U.S. assets."
25,"At the same time, sluggish growth and recessions in other developed countries and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 damped returns elsewhere."
26,Such a buildup of dollar reserves was also consistent with an emphasis on stable exchange rates that fostered exports as means to sustaining high growth rates in their countries.
27,"In addition, the increased willingness of the rest of the world to hold U.S. assets, along with the jump in our productivity growth, contributed to a sharp increase in U.S. equity valuations."
28,"In the United States and elsewhere, monetary and fiscal policies turned stimulative to bolster demand and to stave off unwelcome disinflation."
29,"The size of the stimulus required to accomplish our macroeconomic objectives in the United States was further increased by the sluggish economic growth of our trading partners and by continued demand for dollar assets, which further exacerbated our trade imbalance."
30,"In the aftermath of the recession in the United States, private aggregate demand, both here as well as in Europe and Japan, has strengthened only gradually."
31,This slow rebound has meant that many central banks around the world have held real interest rates low to support real activity and keep inflation stable.
32,"The climate of low interest rates has in turn bolstered asset markets in some countries, especially residential real estate markets."
33,"The associated capital gains, coupled with financial market innovations that make extracting housing equity easier in the United States, help to explain the depressed level of the personal saving rate here; low interest rates themselves also have probably boosted consumption relative to income by reducing the return to saving."
34,"At the same time, demands for dollar-denominated assets have been sustained at a high level."
35,Their actions likely reflect in part a concern about the adequacy of their domestic demand to support the advances in economic activity required for job creation.
36,"This explanation has emphasized a favorable relative return on U.S. investment, coupled with increased foreign willingness to hold dollar assets, as causal factors driving the United States' growing current account deficit and low national saving rate."
37,"That is, a fiscal policy shift toward greater deficits and innovations in financial markets and other structural changes that facilitated household spending worked to lower national saving relative to domestic investment."
38,The resultant upward pressure on rates of return here relative to those abroad have helped to draw in capital and increase the current account deficit.
39,"Almost a year ago, the Federal Reserve started a process of removing the unusual degree of policy accommodation, which was outliving its usefulness as the economic expansion gathered strength and the possibility of declines in inflation receded."
40,"We have not yet finished this task: The federal funds rate appears to be below the level that we would expect to be consistent with the maintenance of stable inflation and full employment over the medium run, and, if growth is sustained and inflation remains contained, we are likely to raise rates further at a measured pace."
41,"By increasing the return to saving and by damping the upward momentum in housing prices, rising interest rates should induce an increase in the personal savings rate, and thereby lessen one of the significant spending imbalances we have noted."
42,"To a great extent, continuation of the current account deficit depends on the willingness of investors to provide financing."
43,"We can speculate that unless a persistently large current account deficit in the United States is accompanied by further and continuous shifts in the world's willingness to increase holdings of dollar-denominated assets in their total portfolios, investors will ultimately require higher ex ante rates of return on their U.S. assets relative to those available on foreign assets."
44,"Governments will eventually see that returns from encouraging domestic investment will outstrip those expected on their growing holdings of dollar reserves, or that more-flexible exchange rates are required to exercise a stabilizing monetary policy."
45,"Over the past few years, we have seen a moderate decline in the dollar, indicating that the demand for dollar-denominated assets is not infinitely elastic."
46,"And, at some point, the current account deficit should start to narrow."
47,"In addition, the process of narrowing deficits may be helped by an autonomous rise in domestic saving."
48,"We do not understand all the reasons for recent low personal saving rates, and the rise in the saving rate could exceed the increase that results from likely movements in interest rates and house prices--especially as households contemplate the adequacy of their retirement income."
49,"To the extent that current spending behavior is built on realistic expectations--in particular, for future short-term interest rates, the exchange rate, rates of return on capital investments in the United States relative to those abroad, and housing price appreciation--the transition should be relatively orderly: Asset prices should adjust gradually to changing developments, as should the spending patterns of households and firms."
50,"In such circumstances, asset prices can adjust sharply, and private spending may also respond quickly, making it difficult for monetary and fiscal policy actions to provide a timely enough counterweight to keep the economy continuously on track."
51,"To a considerable extent, Treasury yields reflect two factors: low actual and expected inflation; and the market's belief that, with growth moderate and inflation contained, the federal funds rate will move up only gradually as the expansion proceeds."
52,"Still, investors seem to expect short-term interest rates to remain on the low side of historical averages for some time."
53,These subdued expectations may reflect a belief that underlying global demand will remain damped and that the world will continue to be willing to invest heavily in the United States.
54,"A couple of years ago I was fairly confident that the rise in real estate prices primarily reflected low interest rates, good growth in disposable income, and favorable demographics."
55,"Prices have gone up far enough since then relative to interest rates, rents, and incomes to raise questions; recent reports from professionals in the housing market suggest an increasing volume of transactions by investors, who (along with homeowners more generally) may be expecting the recent trend of price increases to continue."
56,"Even so, such a distortion would most likely unwind through a slow erosion of real house prices, rather than a sudden crash."
