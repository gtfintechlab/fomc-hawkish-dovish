2,"Economic growth in the period leading up to the October meeting had proven quite strong, as confirmed by this morningâ€™s figures on third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP)."
3,"At its meeting, however, Committee members took the view that tightening credit conditions--the product of ongoing stresses in financial markets--and some intensification of the correction in the housing sector were likely to restrain economic activity going forward."

5,The Committee expected that economic growth would thereafter gradually return to a pace approaching its long-run trend as the drag from housing subsided and financial conditions improved.
6,"Inflation was seen as edging down next year, approaching rates consistent with price stability; however, the Committee remained concerned about the possible effects of higher energy costs and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, especially the risk that they might lead to an increase in the publicâ€™s long-term inflation expectations."

14,"Moreover, increases in food prices and in the prices of some imported goods have the potential to put additional pressures on inflation and inflation expectations."
15,The effectiveness of monetary policy depends critically on maintaining the publicâ€™s confidence that inflation will be well controlled.
16,We are accordingly monitoring inflation developments closely.
