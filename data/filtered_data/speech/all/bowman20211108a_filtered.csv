0,"I will focus my comments today on three areas: the strong increase in home prices in the past year and a half, the wind-down of forbearance programs enacted after the advent of COVID-19, and what we learned about the financial stability risks associated with nonbank mortgage companies during the pandemic."
1,I will start with some comments on home prices.
2,"Home prices had been rising at a moderate rate since 2012, but since mid-2020, their growth has accelerated significantly."
3,"In total, home prices in September were 21 percent higher than in June 2020."
4,Home price increases are also widespread.
5,"In September, about 90 percent of American cities had experienced rising home prices over the past three months, and the home price increases were substantial in most of these cities.2 These sharp increases raise the concern that housing is overvalued and that home prices may decline."
6,"Historically, large home price increases are somewhat less concerning if they are supported by economic fundamentals rather than speculation."
7,The demand for housing has risen for several reasons.
8,"Interest rates are low, families have accumulated savings, and income growth in the past 18 months has been quite strong."
9,Another reason to be less concerned about the recent escalation in home prices is that we do not see much of the decline in underwriting standards that fueled the home price bubble in the mid-2000s.
10,"Nonetheless, home prices do decline from time to time."
11,"In inflation-adjusted terms, U.S. home prices fell from 1979 to 1982 and from 1989 to 1993, although by much less than from 2006 to 2012.3 Although the declines in national home prices were modest in some of these episodes, some areas of the country experienced sharp declines."
12,"As we all know, home price declines cause problems and strain throughout the economy."
13,"To give just one example, families and small business owners borrow against their homes to fund big-ticket purchases and business expansions, and house price declines make it harder to use homes as loan collateral."
14,"This effect can be amplified if a credit crunch occurs, in which lenders react to the decline in house prices by pulling back on their lending."
15,"For example, from my experience living in rural Kansas, I understand how smaller communities with a less diversified housing and employment base can take a long time to recover from a fall in home prices."
16,"Falling home prices would certainly be very dramatic, but continued outsized increases could also be problematic."
17,"First, high home prices make it more difficult for low- to moderate-income households to become homeowners, as larger down payments and other financing requirements effectively lock these households out of the housing market."
18,"Second, and related to one of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals, rising home prices and rents raise the cost of housing."
19,"Because housing costs are a large share of living expenses for most people, these increases are adding to current inflationary pressures in the economy."
20,"In addition, there are signs of underlying supply and demand imbalances that will contribute to increases in housing costs and inflation."
21,"Early in the pandemic, the strength in home prices was thought to be driven by the decline in mortgage rates."
22,"But it has become increasingly clear that the low supply of homes, in combination with a strong demand for housing, is an important part of the story."
23,"These issues affect the rental market too: The multifamily rental market is at historic levels of tightness, with over 95 percent occupancy in major markets.4 I anticipate that these housing supply issues are unlikely to reverse materially in the short term, which suggests that we are likely to see higher inflation from housing for a while."
24,"In the aftermath of the last financial crisis, the flood of foreclosures led to downward pressure on home prices."
25,"Mortgage refinancing surged because of the drop in long-term interest rates, and nonbank servicers used the proceeds from these refinacings to fund the advances associated with forbearance."
26,"However, if home prices had fallen, instead of rising so sharply, many borrowers might have faced obstacles to refinancing because their homes had fallen in value, and so nonbank servicers would not have had revenue from refinancing to put toward paying advances."
27,"In total, nonbanks hold about four times as much in MSRs as they do in cash.9 But MSRs decline in value when home prices fall, and so this borrowing might also have been less available as a funding source in those circumstances."
