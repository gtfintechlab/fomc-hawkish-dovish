2,"October 12, 2007 John Taylor Rules Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn At the Conference on John Taylor's Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas Share The Role of Simple Rules in Monetary Policymaking It is a pleasure and an honor to speak at this conference honoring John Taylor and his contributions to monetary theory and policy."
3,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, macroeconomics was focused mainly on real business cycles and endogenous growth theory."
4,"During this period, John was one of a very small number of academic economists who continued to pursue research aimed at informing the conduct of monetary policy."
5,"Importantly, John's legacy to the Federal Reserve has not been confined to enhancing our understanding of monetary policy."
6,John and I have spent countless hours discussing how the Federal Reserve arrives at decisions about monetary policy and how it should arrive at decisions.
7,"Three Benefits of Simple Rules in Monetary Policymaking In his Carnegie Rochester conference paper, John considered a simple policy rule under which the nominal federal funds rate is adjusted in response to both the gap between real and trend gross domestic product (GDP) and the gap between the inflation rate and policymakers' target."
8,"Based on data for the previous few years, John calibrated the long-run target for inflation and the two parameters that determine the responsiveness of the federal funds rate to the two gaps."
9,The equilibrium real interest rate was based on a longer history of actual real interest rates.
10,"Despite its simplicity, this policy rule fits the data remarkably well; it described a period of generally successful policymaking; and it adhered to the Taylor principle of adjusting the nominal rate more than one-for-one with changes in the inflation rate, so it provided a plausible template for future success."
11,"Following John's seminal contribution, many other economists have engaged in research on similar policy rules and, together with John, have identified several benefits of such rules in conducting monetary policy."
12,"Importantly, the emphasis is on levels and gaps, not growth rates, as inputs to the policy process."
13,"For the United States, the two gaps relate directly to the legislative mandate of the Federal Reserve to achieve stable prices and maximum employment."
14,A second benefit of simple rules is that they help financial market participants form a baseline for expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy.
15,"Indeed, many financial market participants have used the Taylor rule to understand U.S. monetary policy over the past fifteen years."
16,Such an understanding is important for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.
17,Giving the public some sense of how the central bank sees the output and inflation gaps and how they are expected to evolve will help it understand the central bank's objectives and how policymakers are likely to respond to surprises in incoming data.
18,"Four Limitations of Simple Rules Simple rules have limitations, of course, as benchmarks for monetary policy."
19,The first limitation is that the use of a Taylor rule requires that a single measure of inflation be used to obtain the rule prescriptions.
20,The price index used by John in the Carnegie Rochester paper was the GDP price deflator.
21,Other researchers have used the inflation measure based on the consumer price index (CPI).
22,"Over the past fifteen years, the Federal Reserve has emphasized the inflation rate as measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)."
23,"Many researchers have also explored the use of core price indexes, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, as better predictors of future inflation or as more robust indicators of the sticky prices that some theories say should be the targets of policy."
24,"But policy is made in the here and now, and the various indexes can diverge significantly for long stretches, potentially providing different signals for the appropriate course of monetary policy."
25,"Second, the implementation of the Taylor rule and other related rules requires determining the level of the equilibrium real interest rate and the level of potential output; neither of them are observable variables, and both must be inferred from other information."
26,"But the equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate probably varies over time because it depends on factors such as the growth rate of potential output, fiscal policy, and the willingness of savers to supply credit to households and businesses."
27,Inaccurate estimates of this rate will mislead policymakers about the policy stance required to achieve full employment.
28,"If policymakers inadvertently rely on flawed estimates, they will encounter persistent problems in achieving their inflation objective."
29,"The third limitation of using simple rules for monetary policymaking stems from the fact that, by their nature, simple rules involve only a small number of variables."
30,"Moreover, policy is best made looking forward, that is, on the basis of projections of how inflation and economic activity may evolve."
31,"For these reasons, central banks monitor a wide range of indicators in conducting monetary policy."
32,"In his Carnegie Rochester paper, John mentioned the stock market crash of October 1987 as an example of how other variables can and should influence the course of monetary policy in some situations."
33,"In some circumstances, the risks to the outlook or the perceived costs of missing an objective on a particular side may be sufficiently skewed that policymakers will choose to respond by adjusting policy in a way that would not be justified solely by the current state of the economy or the modal outlook for output and inflation gaps."
34,Inflation Measure The first limitation is related to the measure used for the inflation variable included in the rules.
35,"But as you know, the FOMC often looks at core inflation, stripping out the effects of energy and food prices, as a better indicator of future price behavior."
36,"In addition, the dotted line represents an alternative measure of resource utilization derived from the unemployment rate and an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) taken from the Board staff's FRB/US model."
37,"In fact, the unemployment rate was rising through the middle of 2003, so the FOMC had every reason to believe that the output gap was widening at that time."
38,Using this unemployment-based measure rather than the real-time CBO measure would reduce the prescriptions of simple policy rules by roughly 1/2 percentage point in early 2003.
39,"Other things equal, such spreads would reduce the federal funds rate needed to achieve full employment, perhaps explaining a portion of the gap between the actual federal funds rate and the outcome from the policy rule during this period."
40,"As shown in Figure 2A, the core CPI inflation rate for 2003 was falling toward 1 percent."
41,The real-time reading of the core PCE inflation rate (not shown) was on average even lower than the comparable CPI figure.
42,We had carefully analyzed the Japanese experience of the early 1990s; our conclusion was that aggressively moving against the risk of deflation would pay dividends by reducing the odds on needing to deal with the zero bound on nominal interest rates should the economy be hit with another negative shock.
