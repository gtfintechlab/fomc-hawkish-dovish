0,"Information is transmitted instantaneously around the world, and huge shifts in the supply and demand for funds naturally follow."
1,"Companies in Korea and many other Asian countries have become formidable world-class producers in a number of manufacturing sectors using advanced technologies, but in a number of cases--relying on government guarantees, explicit or implicit--they permitted leverage to rise to levels that could only be sustained with continued very rapid growth."
2,"Growth, however, was destined to slow."
3,Asian economies to varying degrees over the last half century have tried to combine rapid growth with a much higher mix of government-directed production than has been evident in the essentially market-driven economies of the West.
4,"Through government inducements, a number of select, more sophisticated manufacturing technologies borrowed from the advanced market economies were applied to these generally low-productivity and, hence, low-wage economies.2 Thus, for selected products, exports became competitive with those of the market economies."
5,"This engendered rapid overall economic growth at a rate far exceeding that of economies at the cutting edge of technology, whose growth has been bound by hard-fought, but slow, accretions to knowledge."
6,"As the process broadened beyond a few select applications of advanced technologies, overall productivity continued to increase and the associated rise in the average real wage in these economies blunted somewhat the competitive advantage enjoyed initially."
7,Slackening of export growth was inevitable.
8,"In addition, losses in competitiveness as a result of exchange rates that were pegged to the dollar, which has appreciated against the yen since early 1995, slowed aggregate economic growth somewhat, even before the current crisis developed."
9,"So long as growth was vigorous, the adverse consequences of this type of non-market allocation of resources were masked."
10,"Moreover, in the context of pegged exchange rates that were presumed to continue, if not indefinitely, at least beyond the term of the loan, banks and nonbanks were willing to take the risk to borrow dollars (unhedged) to obtain the dollar-denominated interest rates that were invariably lower than those available in domestic currency."
11,Some exchange rates have fallen to levels that are understandable only in the context of a veritable collapse of confidence in the functioning of an economy.
12,"It is clear, for example, that neither changes in the relative purchasing power of the Indonesian rupiah, nor the relevant interest rates, can explain the more than four-fifths decline in the rupiah relative to the U.S. dollar by early 1998."
13,"The sharp exchange rate changes in East Asia in recent months, as similar instances elsewhere, do not appear to have resulted wholly from a measured judgment that fundamental forces have turned appreciably more adverse."
14,"The exchange rate changes appear the consequences, not of the accumulation of new knowledge of a deterioration in fundamentals, but of its opposite: the onset of uncertainties that destroy previous understandings of the way the world works."
15,"In late 1994, the government was rapidly losing reserves in a vain effort to support a currency that had come under attack when the authorities failed to act expeditiously and convincingly to contain a burgeoning current account deficit financed in large part by substantial short-term flows denominated in dollars."
16,"The loss of confidence that one understands the dynamics of the systems with which we are engaged can trigger rapid and disruptive changes in the pattern of finance, which, in turn, feed back on exchange rates and asset prices."
17,"The United States experienced such a sudden change with the decline in stock prices of more than 20 percent on October 19, 1987."
18,"When crossed, prices slip into free fall--perhaps overshooting the long-term equilibrium--before markets will stabilize."
19,"Certainly, there were indications that Thailand's large current account deficits were unsustainable."
20,"Once the recent crisis was triggered in early July with Thailand's eventual forced abandonment of its exchange rate peg, it was apparently the lethal combination of pegged exchange rates, high leverage, weak banking and financial systems, and declining demand in Thailand and elsewhere that transformed a correction into a collapse."
21,"But with a significant part of short-term liabilities, bank and nonbank, denominated in dollars or other foreign currencies, unhedged, the initial pressure on domestic currencies was apparently too much to bear, leading to a sharp crack in the fixed exchange rate structure of many East Asian economies."
22,"Local exchange rates fell against the dollar, inducing still further declines."
23,The weakening of growth also led to lowered profit expectations and contracting net capital inflows of dollars.
24,The combination of continued strong demand for dollars to meet debt service obligations and the slowed new supply destabilized the previously fixed exchange rate regime.
25,"This created a marked increase in uncertainty and retrenchment, further reducing capital inflows, still further weakening local currency exchange rates."
26,"This vicious cycle will continue until either defaults or restructuring lowers debt service obligations, or the low local exchange rates finally induce a pickup in the supply of dollars."
27,"Banks, when confronted with a generally rising yield curve, have a tendency to incur interest rate or liquidity risk by lending long and funding short."
28,"To effectively support a stable currency, central banks need to be independent, meaning that their monetary policy decisions are not subject to the dictates of political authorities."
29,Their breakdown induces a sharp weakening in economic growth.
30,"A wider range of nonbank institutions, including viable debt and equity markets, are important safeguards of economic activity when banking fails."
31,"Among the important signals are product and asset prices, interest rates, debt by maturity, detailed accounts of central banks, and private enterprises."
32,In today's rapidly changing marketplace producers need sophisticated signals to hone production schedules and investment programs to respond to consumer demand.
33,"For example, firms now appreciate more fully the importance of the tails of the probability distributions of the shocks and of the assumptions about the covariance of price changes."
34,"If the proper policies are pursued and there is support from the international community, the process of recovery can begin soon and the structural reforms necessary for more durable growth will be underway."
