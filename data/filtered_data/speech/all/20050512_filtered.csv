0,"Proponents of globalization cite a wider array of goods and services available for consumers, greater market competition and lower prices, new financial instruments for savers, possibilities for greater and more-productive investments, and strengthened market discipline of government policies."
1,All of these benefits could translate into faster economic growth and higher real incomes for most people.
2,"From 1984 to 2003, U.S. investment holdings abroad more than tripled after controlling for inflation, while real U.S. gross domestic product did not quite double."
3,"In 2002, the gross value of cross-border equity trades was 80 percent of worldwide equity market capitalization, whereas in 1989 cross-border trades equaled only 18 percent of a much smaller world equity market.2 Given these developments, it is not surprising that financial asset prices in various countries appear to move together more than they used to."
4,"Without getting into an extended discussion about the relative importance of such possible sources, I note that many of them are expected to continue to diminish, and so investors' portfolios will likely become more diversified as time passes.9 What about prices of financial assets?"
5,"Here a simple benchmark is the law of one price: The same asset should have the same price everywhere, after proper adjustment for transaction and transport costs, taxes, risk, and so forth."
6,"In cases where this strict definition can be applied, the law of one price usually does hold to a very good approximation--for example, on bonds of multinational corporations issued in the same currency in different jurisdictions or on depositary receipts of foreign equities relative to the underlying equities in their home markets."
7,"But in many cases, what is of interest is whether similar financial assets are priced similarly--for example, similarly rated bonds in different countries."
8,"On the other hand, prices of at least some low-risk, liquid instruments appear to be comparable around the world, and prices of liquid assets all around the world react very quickly to news.10 On the other hand, research shows that markets are not as efficient at equating the prices of risky assets, particularly those that are not liquid, so there may still be considerable scope for convergence of asset prices.11 As with the equity-price correlations I described earlier, the correlations of monthly changes in government bond yields have trended up over the past twenty years, to around 0.8 for correlations between yields in the United States and those in major European countries since early 2000."
9,I suspect that the convergence of inflation rates and inflation expectations to common low levels is an important factor.
10,I will return later to the possibility that globalization has helped lead to low inflation around the world.
11,"Other possible contributing factors to low global bond yields include expectations that real activity and investment demand in the major regions will continue to grow at a moderate pace, reduced concerns about shocks to this growth outlook, and large purchases of bonds by Asian central banks."
12,"The high cost to would-be immigrants of entering illegally includes not only the risk of detection and deportation but, in many cases, fees of several hundred to several thousand dollars demanded by smugglers who promise to get immigrants into their destination countries."
13,The other main aspect of globalized product markets is the growth of foreign direct investment.
14,"Since 1988, employment in U.S. operations of foreign corporations has risen by 2.3 million jobs to a total of 5.4 million, or roughly 5 percent of total U.S. employment.20 A relatively recent development in international direct investment is the rise of multinationals that have grown out of emerging markets, including companies such as Mittal Steel, Hyundai Motors, and the Haier Group of home-appliance makers."
15,"Opening up markets to greater competition leads to lower prices and higher-quality products, which translates into higher real incomes for most people."
16,"Indeed, recent research shows that multinationals have made a disproportionate contribution to the acceleration of U.S. productivity since the mid-1990s.22 So if globalization has helped to increase competition and variety while lowering costs, why do so many oppose it?"
17,"Economists who have studied rising income inequality in America generally conclude that, although international trade and migration have contributed slightly, the main factor by far has been progress in information technology, which has boosted the demand for educated workers relative to those with low skills.23 Yet another potential implication of globalization is that the distribution of incomes across countries will shift."
18,"Professors Edward Leamer of UCLA and Peter Schott of Yale have recently suggested that the significant gains in Chinese and Indian per capita income over the past twenty years may have come at the expense of income growth in the so-called ""middle income"" developing countries such as Argentina and Brazil."
19,The importance of managing risk related to foreign exchange rate fluctuations usually grows with the size of a firm's foreign sales and production.
20,"As society as a whole benefits from trade, so it is only fair that society assist the few who pay a price for our progress."
21,"A more flexible economy ought to be inherently more stable and more resilient to shocks, and thus present less need for activist policy to stabilize output and inflation."
22,"Globalization has progressed in conjunction with a substantial narrowing of inflation differentials across countries over the past twenty years, as the number of countries with high inflation has declined.26 It may be that globalized financial markets are more effective at punishing inflationary policies and that increased competition in goods markets helps to tame inflationary pressure."
23,But another explanation is simply that central banks around the world learned about the costs of inflationary policies after the experience of the 1970s.
24,"However, I tend to believe that these financial crises often arise from macroeconomic policies that are inherently unstable and from private-sector participants who fail to recognize and price risk appropriately."
25,The resulting financial flows drove up the prices of U.S. bonds and equities at the same time that Asian demand for U.S. exports fell and the U.S. current account deficit widened.
26,"In a simple macroeconomic model (IS/LM), globalization enhances the exchange rate channel of monetary policy.27 For example, stimulative monetary policy has a greater tendency to weaken a country's currency in a globalized world."
27,Of course this model makes some strong simplifying assumptions about expectations and price adjustment.
