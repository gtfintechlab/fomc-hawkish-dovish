2,"In the case of the Federal Reserve, our responsibilities include ensuring that banks are well supervised and regulated, working with other government agencies through the Financial Stability Oversight Council to promote financial stability, and, of course, conducting a U.S. monetary policy that aims to achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
3,"As the title of my talk suggests, my remarks today will focus on the importance of some specific global financial linkages that are relevant to the execution and communication of U.S. monetary policy aimed at achieving our domestic mandates."
4,"First, yield curves for nominal and inflation-indexed bonds provide usefulâ€”if also noisyâ€”information about the expected future path of the policy rate, inflation, the business cycle, and the term premium required to hold sovereign bonds."
5,"Second, yields on long-maturity bonds represent, generally, a key channel in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and, specifically, are a fundamental building block markets use to discount cash flows relevant for valuing financial assets."
6,"First, this correlation will be present if the underlying macro fundamentalsâ€”for example, productivity growth, savingâ€“investment imbalances, and longer-term inflation expectationsâ€”that drive the factors are correlated across countries.2 Second, as is emphasized in Clarida (2019c) and Obstfeld (2020), this correlation will also be present if countries are tightly financially integrated even if fundamentals themselves are independent across countries.3 Interpreting the Global Level Factor From any set of level and slope factors extracted across a collection of sovereign yield curves, one can in turn extract a global level factor and a global slope factor that account for the correlation among the country-specific level and slope factors.4 As can be seen in figure 1, the global level factor (the blue line) accounts for most of the evident downward trend and much of the variation relative to that trend in the estimated U.S., U.K., and German level factors."
7,"Plausibly, the global level factor embedded in these three sovereign yield curves reflects the contribution of possibly several global macro fundamental driversâ€”including global productivity growth, the balance between global saving and investment, and longer-term inflation expectationsâ€”and likely also other ""market"" or ""technical"" factors specific to the trading of these sovereigns in the global bond market."
8,"As can be seen in figure 2, however, most of the trend and variation in the global level factor about this trend can be accounted for by the evolution of estimates of the neutral real interest rates in these countries.5 Figure 2 plots the global level factor against a simple average of the Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017, henceforth HLW) time-series estimates of $$r\ast\ $$â€”the neutral real interest rate consistent with trend growth and stable inflationâ€”for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany."
9,"And because central banks, including the Federal Reserve, typically channel Milton Friedman (1968) and believe that the evolution of $$r\ast\ $$ primarily reflects nonmonetary factors that are beyond the central bank's control, an ""$$r\ast\ $$ theory"" of the level factorâ€”if trueâ€”has important implications for how central banks extract signal from noise from sovereign yield curves as well as for how they calibrate the stance of monetary policy consistent with a credible inflation target."
10,"Under this interpretation, and as was anticipated years ago by Greenspan (2005), Bernanke (2005), Clarida (2005), and others, credible inflation-targeting central banks operating in an integrated global capital marketâ€”at least when they are operating away from their effective lower bound (ELB)â€”are primarily in the yield curve ""slope"" business, but much less so in the yield curve ""level"" business.6 Figure 3 shows the relationship between the yield on a 10-year Treasury note and an estimate of the neutral nominal U.S. policy rate, which I set equal to the HLW estimate of $$r\ast\ $$ for the United States plus a 2 percent inflation objective, a proxy for the neutral nominal interest rate when longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2 percent target."
11,"As is evident from the figure and as can be verified econometrically, there has been since at least the 1990s a stable, mean-reverting dynamic relationship between the benchmark nominal Treasury yield and a neutral nominal interest rate proxy derived from the HLW time-series estimates for $$r\ast\ $$ in the United States."
12,Interpreting the Slope Factor I would now like to illustrate what I mean when I say that the slope of the yield curve is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted.
13,"Identifying Causation from Bond Yield Correlations It is a truism that ""correlation is not causation,"" and this is especially the case when trying to interpret contemporaneous correlation among asset prices generally and among bond yields in particular."
14,"There is a vast literature (Claessens, Stracca, and Warnock, 2016, provide an overview) that documents the existence of spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging market (EM) financial conditions, although the recent paper by Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2020) suggests that the degree of those spillovers depends importantly on the source of the shock that triggers changes in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy."
15,"In particular, as summarized in figure 5.1, they identified FOMC actions associated with ""growth news"" as those that were immediately followed by changes in the 10-year Treasury yield and the S&P 500 index in the same direction, whereas actions associated with ""monetary news"" elicited changes in yields and equity prices in opposite directions."
16,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 5.2, was that FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions."
17,"While I certainly believe that both fundamental and financial shocks originating in the United States propagate throughout the global financial system and likely account for a significant share of the asset price correlations across global markets that we observe in the data, the evidenceâ€”and introspectionâ€”suggests to me that causality can and often does run both ways.10 Anecdotally, it is not difficult to recall eventsâ€”plausibly exogenous to the United Statesâ€”that have triggered spillovers from foreign sovereign markets to the U.S. Treasury market."
18,"For instance, Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) examined 12 years of monetary policy announcements by the FOMC and the European Central Bank (ECB)â€”a combined total of 266 monetary policy communicationsâ€”focusing on how sovereign yields in one jurisdiction responded to monetary policy announcements made in the other."
