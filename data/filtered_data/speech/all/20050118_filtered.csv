1,"Labor markets have continued to improve gradually, with private nonfarm payroll employment posting a sizable gain in 2004."
2,"Consumer spending appears to have been robust during the holiday season, despite some restraint from higher energy prices, and business outlays for capital equipment are on an upward trend."
3,"On the inflation front, broad measures of consumer inflation have risen somewhat faster than they did in the year-earlier period, boosted by higher energy prices."
4,"Focusing on the core price index, which excludes food and energy, it has been a bit higher than it was the year before."
5,"This reflects changes in the pattern of prices of goods (as opposed to services) purchased by consumers, as prices of goods that had been falling in 2003 began to stabilize and rise slightly in 2004."

9,Some analysts have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years and the decline in the household saving rate.
10,"This rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices."
11,"Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years."
12,"Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these ""refis,"" often to pay down loans having higher interest rates."
13,"On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt."
14,"The low interest rates of the past few years, however, will give way as the economy continues to expand, and we have already seen an uptick in mortgage rates and on some other consumer loans during this past year."
15,"First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates."
16,"Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could occur rather slowly."
17,Another concern is that house prices will reverse and erase a considerable amount of home equity built up in recent years.
18,"Recent gains in house prices have been notable: the average house price rose 13 percent in the year through the third quarter of 2004, and cumulative gains since 1997 now top 60 percent.1 Despite a rise in mortgage debt, the current loan-to-value ratio for outstanding mortgages is estimated to be around 45 percent, roughly the level that has prevailed since the mid-1990s."
19,"While new originations of mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios in recent years would push this share up, the substantial house price appreciation in that same period likely improved the financial positions of the households with high loan-to-value ratios in 2001."
20,"While the experience of the past three years of exceptionally low interest rates and lower expected stock returns encouraged a rational consumer to spend and not save, as the markets return to more long-term trends, we should see consumers moderate their behavior as well."

23,Firms have taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to refinance high-cost debt.
24,"These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term."
25,"Moreover, research by the Board staff suggests that firms that rely more on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have in recent years tended to use derivatives to hedge some of their exposure to interest rate risk."
26,"Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and spread out over time."
27,"Also, as we learned from the episode of policy tightening in 1994, rising interest rates have little detrimental effect on the financial health of the corporate sector when the rate increases occur in the context of an expanding economy."
28,"Indeed, corporate credit quality improved on balance after 1994 with the pickup in economic activity and corporate profits."

31,"At the end of 2002, the majority of S&P 500 plans were underfunded, with a net shortfall that had grown to more than $200 billion, as stock market losses from 2000-02 eroded the value of assets and declining interest rates raised the current value of plan liabilities."
32,"Since then, companies have made large cash contributions to shore up these plans and equity prices have risen, reducing the aggregate underfunding for S&P 500 companies to around $125 billion at the end of 2004."
33,"As workers began to change jobs more frequently, however, they increased their demand for defined contribution retirement plans because of their portability and the more-even pattern of benefit accruals over a worker's career."
