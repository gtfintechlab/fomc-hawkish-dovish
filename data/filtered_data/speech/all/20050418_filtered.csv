2,"Consumer spending also has continued to expand, although higher energy prices may be crimping household purchases recently."
3,"On the inflation front, broad measures of consumer inflation have risen somewhat faster than they did in the year-earlier period, boosted by higher energy prices."
4,"Focusing on the core price index, which excludes food and energy, it too has been a bit higher than it was the year before, likely reflecting the indirect effects of rising energy prices and the falling dollar."
5,Productivity is slowing from its exceptional pace of the past couple years and unit labor costs are again increasing.
6,"Though inflation pressures have risen somewhat in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained."
7,"I believe that, while underlying inflation is expected to continue to be low, the Federal Reserve must be more alert to monitoring incoming data, and continue to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace, consistent with the incoming data and its commitment to maintain price stability."
8,Financial Conditions of Businesses Business expansion solidified last year and continued growth by businesses will depend in part on their financial conditions.
9,"In addition, firms have significantly cut costs through dramatic gains in productivity, which has boosted profits."
10,"In my view, even with a rise in interest rates and some moderation in profit growth, the business sector should remain financially strong and continue to expand."
11,Firms have taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to pay down short-term debt with longer-maturity debt.
12,"In addition, many firms have taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to refinance high-cost debt, and others have used profits from operations or asset sales to retire debt."
13,"These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term."
14,"Moreover, research by the Board staff suggests that firms that rely more on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have in recent years tended to use derivatives to hedge some of their exposure to interest rate risk."
15,"Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and spread out over time."
16,"Also, as we learned from the episode of policy tightening in 1994, rising interest rates have little detrimental effect on the financial health of the corporate sector when the rate increases occur in the context of an expanding economy."

20,"Household Financial Conditions In the household sector, some analysts have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years and the decline in the household saving rate."
21,"This rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates, strong growth in house prices, and an increasing share of households owning their home rather than renting."
22,"Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple years."
23,"Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these ""refis,"" often to pay down loans having higher interest rates."
24,"On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt."
25,"The low interest rates of the past few years, however, will give way as the economy continues to expand, and we have already seen an increase in mortgage rates and on some other consumer loans during this past year."
26,"First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates."
27,"Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could occur rather slowly."
28,Another concern is that house prices will reverse and erase a considerable amount of home equity built up in recent years.
29,"Recent gains in house prices have been notable: the average house price rose 11 percent in 2004, and cumulative gains since 1997 now top 65 percent.1 Despite a rise in mortgage debt, the current loan-to-value ratio for outstanding mortgages is estimated to be around 45 percent, roughly the level that has prevailed since the mid-1990s."
30,"While new originations of mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios in recent years would push this share up, the substantial house price appreciation in that same period likely improved the financial positions of the households with high loan-to-value ratios in 2001."
31,"However, we are beginning to see signs that housing prices may be reaching a peak in some markets."
32,"Not only will these households face higher monthly payments as interest rates rise, they are also not building equity in their homes as quickly as they would with a traditional amortizing mortgage."
33,"While the experience of the past few years of exceptionally low interest rates and lower expected stock returns encouraged a rational consumer to spend and not save, as the markets return to more long-term trends, we should see consumers moderate their behavior as well."
34,"In addition, as workers have become more mobile and more likely to change jobs several times over the course of their careers, they have increased their demand for retirement savings vehicles that are portable and have benefits that are less tied to longevity at a single firm."
