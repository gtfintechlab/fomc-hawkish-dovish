2,"From there, I will discuss my views on monetary policy, including the new long-run monetary policy strategy recently announced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
3,The momentum is feeding into many private-sector forecasts that suggest prospects are good for strong economic growth in the United States and other advanced economies over the rest of this year and next.
4,"Incomes and employment are likely to lag below pre-COVID event levels for some time, which would put stress on the finances of many families."
5,"These closures may lead to some longer-term scarring of the economy through lower investment, reduced capacity, and long-term unemployment leading some to drop out of the labor force altogether."
6,The historic collapse in economic activity in March and April will take time to reverse.
7,"For example, the Census Bureau reports that applications by people seeking to start new businesses have surged this summer.2 The median of projections for 2020 by FOMC participants in September showed that both gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation had been revised up significantly from the median in the June projections.3 I expect that robust GDP growth over the rest of this year and in 2021 will lead to strong employment gains and move inflation closer to 2 percent."
8,"Turning now to the labor market, unemployment was still at 8.4 percent in August and the labor force participation rate still down significantly from February."
9,"But the act's unemployment provisions have expired, and most of the businesses that received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans report that they have exhausted those funds.4 In addition, one area where increased understanding of the disease has, in many places, not led to general changes in practice is in the widespread school closures this fall."
10,"Although still unacceptably high, an 8.4 percent unemployment rate represents a considerable improvement from 14.7 percent in April and is already much lower than many thought possible this year.5 By comparison, after the onset of the Great Recession, it took more than two years to reduce unemployment from the peak of 10 percent to 8.4 percent."
11,"However, some indicators point to slower improvement in the job market going forward."
12,"Like employment, consumer spending has been much stronger than expected, even though spending on travel and many other categories of in-person services remains depressed."
13,"Retail sales were extremely strong from May through August, driven by demand for consumer durables such as automobiles, furniture, and home improvement."
14,The strength in the consumer and housing sectors is being supported by Fed action to lower interest rates and support credit availability for creditworthy borrowers.
15,"In addition, the recent high rate of household savings likely represents a significant source of pent-up demand."
16,"Since then, vacancy rates have risen significantly and rents have fallen sharply, putting at risk the high valuations that our May Financial Stability Report flagged as a vulnerability.10 The sharp decrease in output and employment, as well as continued slack in the economy, have put downward pressure on wages and the prices of goods and services affected by the COVID event."
17,The 12-month increase in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) dropped to about 0.5 percent in April.
18,"Although the recovery since then has helped prices retrace some of those declines, PCE inflation was still only 1 percent for the 12 months ended in July and is likely to end 2020 well below our 2 percent longer-run target.11 Indicators of future inflation do not point to rapid acceleration."
19,"Market measures of inflation expectations decreased sharply earlier this year before recovering to their previous levels recently, and inflation expectations in some surveys of professional forecasters have ticked down."
20,The Committee will be closely watching for a further recovery of inflation and signs that inflation expectations remain well anchored as we set monetary policy.
21,"Monetary Policy, Short Term and Longer Term In the near term, with both employment and inflation significantly short of the FOMC's economic goals, the prescription is for a sustained aggressive use of monetary policy to support the economy."
22,"Taking a step back, beginning in 2019, the FOMC undertook a public review of the conceptual framework for how we approach monetary policy."
23,"And last month, the FOMC updated its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which I will call the ""consensus statement."
24,I believe the new consensus statement lays out a strategy that is suited to the demands of setting monetary policy in our constantly changing economy.
25,"First, over the past two decades, the prevailing level of interest rates in many advanced economies has declined, leaving central bankers with less room to cut interest rates when the economy slows."
26,"In addition, experience over the past few decades has shown us that the traditionally strong relationship between unemployment and inflation has weakened, perhaps considerably.15 We saw this weakening relationship in the United States, as the robust expansion before the COVID event led to historic and broad-based labor market gains."
27,"Not only did the unemployment rate drop to long-time lows, but the wages of low- and moderate-income workers also accelerated, and unemployment rates for historically disadvantaged groups fell to record lows."
28,"Yet inflation continued to run modestly below our symmetric 2 percent target, for almost the entire period, and long-term interest rates remained very low by historical standards.16 This recent experience in the United States, which has also played out elsewhere, has led to a growing consensus in the economics profession that the relationship between unemployment and inflationâ€”commonly known as the Phillips curveâ€”has flattened."
29,"Therefore, given the considerable benefits that we observed when unemployment fell to very low levels in recent years, the Committee determined that a low unemployment rate, unless accompanied by worrisome developments in inflation or other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals, would not necessitate a policy response."
30,"We capture this change in the revised consensus statement by tying future policy decisions to ""shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than to ""deviations"" from the maximum level as in the previous statement."
31,"The new framework statement also highlights that the maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal, and it reiterates that the Committee will review a wide range of indicatorsâ€”not just the unemployment rateâ€”in its assessments of that level."
32,I believe these changes to the way the FOMC responds to labor market conditions will result in a stronger economy without jeopardizing our commitment to low and stable inflation.
33,"In fact, I think that meeting our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation as defined by the 12-month change in the overall PCE price index, which is unchanged by this revision, will help achieve the kind of labor market outcomes we have experienced in recent years."
34,"Even before the COVID event pushed inflation down to very low levels this year, PCE inflation had been running modestly below 2 percent for some time, and some measures of inflation expectations had decreased to the low ends of their historical ranges."
35,"These developments certainly bear watching, especially if inflation were to remain lower than it had been in previous years or if inflation expectations were to decrease further."
36,"A decrease in inflation expectations can lead to a downward spiral in actual inflation, which would further reduce already low equilibrium nominal interest rates and, among other consequences, leave the FOMC with less flexibility to address future economic slowdowns."
37,"In order to better anchor long-run inflation expectations at 2 percent, the consensus statement makes a distinct change from the old approach."
38,"The Committee will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, which means that we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods when inflation has been persistently below 2 percent."
39,"In the previous consensus statement, the FOMC committed to a 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation that was to be ""symmetric."""
40,"This wording already suggested some tolerance for inflation above 2 percent when it was consistent with meeting our employment mandate, and I certainly never viewed 2 percent inflation as a ceiling."
41,One reason to be comfortable with inflation at times running moderately above 2 percent is that defining and measuring inflation are very much an inexact science.
42,"For that reason, I have always considered alternative indicators of inflationâ€”such as the Dallas Fed trimmed mean and, of course, core inflationâ€”in my assessment of the likely longer-run path for the headline PCE price index."
43,"As a result, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored close to 2 percent, modest deviations of any particular measure of inflation around 2 percent are not a first-order concern in my decision framework."
44,"In fact, I likely will be even more patient in reacting to small upward deviations, given the Committee's move to focus on shortfalls of employment from maximum employment rather than deviations."
45,"By providing additional monetary policy accommodation through stronger, outcomes-based forward guidance, the Committee hopes to quicken the pace of the recovery."
46,"Conclusion In conclusion, the COVID event was an enormous economic shock in the first half of 2020, but a recovery is underway, and the world seems to be adjusting in ways that allow us to address public concerns about the virus without sudden stops in economic activity."
