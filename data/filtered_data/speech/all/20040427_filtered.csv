0,"Six years is a period long enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil and gas, and hence futures prices at that horizon can be viewed as effective long-term supply prices."
1,"These elevated long-term prices, if sustained, could alter the magnitude of and manner in which the United States consumes energy."
2,"Until recently, long-term expectations of oil and gas prices appeared benign."
3,"When choosing capital projects, businesses could mostly look through short-run fluctuations in prices to moderate prices over the longer haul."
4,"Although the effect of these developments on energy-related investments is significant, it doubtless will fall far short of the large changes in our capital stock that followed the 1970s surge in crude oil prices."
5,"Much of the energy displacement occurred by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil."
6,"This more-modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil and natural gas prices that prevailed between 1985 and 2000 and that carried over into electric power prices."
7,"One might expect that, as a consequence of what has been a dramatic shift from the hit-or-miss wildcat oil and gas exploration and development of the past to more-advanced technologies, the cost of developing new fields and, hence, the long-term supply price of new oil and gas would have declined."
8,"Still, distant futures prices for crude oil moved lower, on net, during the 1990s as a result of declining long-term marginal costs of extraction."
9,The most-distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel just before the first Gulf War to $16 to $18 a barrel in 1999.
10,"Distant futures for natural gas, which were less than $2 per million Btu at the time of the first Gulf War drifted up to $2.50 per million Btu by 1999, although those prices remained below the prices of oil on an equivalent Btu basis."
11,Such long-term price tranquility has faded noticeably over the past four years.
12,"Between 1990 and 2000, although spot prices ranged between $11 and $35 per barrel, distant futures exhibited little variation."
13,"Currently prices for delivery in 2010 of light sweet crude, roughly equal to West Texas intermediate, have risen to more than $27 per barrel."
14,Even the spikes in the spot price in 2000 had only a temporary effect on distant natural gas futures prices.
15,"That situation changed in 2001, however, when the distant futures prices for gas delivery at the Henry Hub began a rise from $3.20 per million Btu to almost $5 today."
16,"The reasons for the sharp increases in both crude and gas distant futures prices seem reasonably straightforward, though they differ in important respects."
17,The strength of crude oil prices presumably reflects fears of long-term supply disruptions in the Middle East that have resulted in an increase in risk premiums being added to the cost of capital.
18,"Although there are competitive spillovers from the higher price of oil, the causes of the rise in the long-term supply price of natural gas appear related primarily to supply and demand in North America."
19,"Dramatic changes in technology in recent years, while making existing natural gas reserves stretch further, have been unable, in the face of inexorably rising demand, to keep the underlying long-term price for natural gas in the United States from rising."
20,"* * * Over the past few decades, short-term movements in domestic prices in the markets for crude oil have been determined largely by international market participants, especially OPEC."
21,"Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller endeavored with some success to control those prices."
22,"After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing power remained with the United States--first with the U.S. oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised allowable output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp declines."
23,"However, that historical role came to an end in 1971, when excess capacity in the United States was finally absorbed by rising demand."
24,"During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura rose to more than $11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per barrel that had been unchanged from 1961 to 1970."
25,The sharp price increases of the early 1970s brought to an abrupt end the extraordinary period of growth in U.S. oil consumption and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades immediately following World War II.
26,"Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of oil products rose at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth of real gross domestic product."
27,"Although OPEC production quotas have been a significant factor in price determination for a third of a century, the story since 1973 has been as much one of the power of markets as of power over markets."
28,The signals provided by market prices have eventually resolved even the most seemingly insurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply in the United States.
29,The gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period was feared by many to be so large that rationing would be the only practical solution.
30,"To be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks accompanied slower growth of gasoline demand."
31,"Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that were imported into the United States markets grew significantly in the late 1970s after the Iranian Revolution drove up crude oil prices to nearly $40 per barrel."
32,"Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher."
33,Our Department of Energy had baseline projections showing prices reaching $60 per barrel--the equivalent of more than twice that in today's prices.
34,The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of markets and the technologies they foster.
35,"Today, despite its recent surge, the price of crude oil in real terms is only half of what it was in December 1979."

37,"OPEC, the source of greatest supply flexibility, has endeavored to calibrate crude oil liftings to price."

39,"Natural gas pricing, on the other hand, is inherently far more volatile than oil, doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed, price-damping global trade."
40,And high natural gas prices projected by distant futures prices have made imported gas a more attractive option for us.
41,"The prices of crude oil and products are subject to much price arbitrage, which has the effect of encouraging the transportation of supplies from areas of relative surplus to those of relative shortage and of thereby containing local price spikes."
42,"Without the flexibility such facilities impart, imbalances in supply and demand must inevitably engender price volatility."
