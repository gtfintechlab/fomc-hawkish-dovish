0,"Owing largely to the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than three decades and rising home prices, close to 10 million regular home mortgages were refinanced."
1,"Of last year's cash-outs, approximately $70 billion was apparently applied to repayment of home-equity loans, and a significant part was employed to reduce higher-cost credit card debt, judging from the slowed pace of growth in installment debt outstanding."
2,"An even greater support to the economy than cash-outs last year was the extraction of home equity associated with a record 6.4 million existing home sales, including condos, at record prices."
3,"Despite the exceptionally large extraction of equity, the total remaining equity at the end of 2002 was higher in dollar terms than at the beginning of the year, owing to a 7 percent increase in existing home prices over the four quarters of last year and $300 billion in new home construction, net of mortgage extensions on those homes."
4,"With home price increases now subsiding, and mortgage interest rates no longer declining at last year's impressive pace, some slowdown in the rate of mortgage debt expansion is to be expected."
5,"Home price change, of course, is also a factor, but it is the average change over the length of occupancy--nearly ten years for the typical homeowner--that matters, not recent price trends."
6,"Similarly, refinancing and the cash-outs associated with them accelerated last year as the decline in mortgage interest rates on new loans far exceeded the modest decline in the average rate on all outstanding regular home mortgages."
7,So any stabilizing of rates on new mortgages would narrow the spread as portfolio rates continue to decline as a consequence of continued refinancing at interest rates still below the portfolio average.
8,"Existing home prices (as measured by the repeat-sales index) rose by 7 percent during 2002, and by a third during the past four years."
9,"And recently, price increases have clearly slowed."
10,"It is, of course, possible for home prices to fall as they did in a couple of quarters in 1990."
11,"Local conditions dominate, even though mortgage interest rates are similar throughout the country."
12,"Home prices in Portland, Maine, do not arbitrage those in Portland, Oregon."
13,"The level of overall new home construction, including manufactured homes, appears to be well supported by steady household formation and not dependent on high and variable replacement needs or second-home demand."
14,"In evaluating the possible prevalence of housing price bubbles, it is important to keep in mind that home prices tend to consistently rise relative to the general price level in this country."
15,"In fact, over the past half century, the annual pace of home price increases has been approximately 1 percentage point faster on average than the rise in the GDP deflator."
16,This is apparently the result of productivity growth on largely custom built new home construction persistently lagging productivity in the economy overall.
17,"This lag in productivity growth drives up new home prices relative to the general price level and, by arbitrage, it drives up the prices of existing homes as well."
18,"In addition, local building and land use restrictions continue to constrain the supply of buildable land in many areas, whose price increases also tend to outstrip the rate of inflation."
19,"Clearly, after their very substantial run-up in recent years, home prices could recede."
20,"Nonetheless, even modestly declining home prices would reduce the level of unrealized capital gains and presumably dampen the pace of home equity extraction."
21,Home mortgage cash-outs and home equity loan expansion would likely decline in the face of declining home prices.
22,"However, the five-year old home building and mortgage finance boom is less likely to be defused by declining home prices than by rising mortgage interest rates."
