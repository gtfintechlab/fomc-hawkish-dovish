4,Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.
5,The job market remains strong.
6,The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half.
7,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.

9,"Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent."
10,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges."
11,We’re mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations.
12,"However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent."
13,"Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely."

15,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks."
16,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year."

19,"We believe monetary policy October 30, 2019 is in a good place to achieve these outcomes."
20,Let me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations.
21,"In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime."
22,These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.
23,They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
24,"In those programs, we purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions."
25,"In contrast, October 30, 2019 increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short-term Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly."
26,"The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending."
27,"But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up."
28,"It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective."
29,"So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure."
30,"What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter."
31,"Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now."
32,"The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, October 30, 2019 you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that’s their principle focus."
33,"So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now."
34,Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.
35,"And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of, really, the recent months."
36,"And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis."
37,"So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate—likely to remain appropriate—as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent."
38,"So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are—they’re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation."
39,We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
40,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time."
41,But we’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation.
42,"And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area."
43,"These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say."
44,Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.
45,"I wouldn’t expect that the effects on activity or confidence Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL would be immediate, or—would there be immediate effects in economic activity."
46,So that’s really about inflation.
47,"And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back."
48,So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.
49,You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.
50,"And we’ve had inflation, which—we’ve called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address."
51,"That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent."
52,"We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity."
53,"You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths, I think, this quarter."
54,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is."
55,"Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand."
56,"I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver."
57,"And, you know, there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now."
58,And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy.
59,"In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years."
60,"That’s why we—you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet."
61,"So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend."
62,I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future.
63,"You know, it’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument."
64,"So we can’t—obviously, we can’t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places."

66,"The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes."
67,"Let me put it this way: We do what we do, which is, we’re assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices."
68,"The U.S. economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things."
69,"But if you really want the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need—you need proper monetary policy."

74,"So we—we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world."
75,"But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places."
76,"But we don’t think—again, we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
77,It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.
78,"The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very hard for them to get off."
79,"Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down."
80,"You have less—interest rates move down as well, because there’s an inflation component in interest rates."
81,"And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
