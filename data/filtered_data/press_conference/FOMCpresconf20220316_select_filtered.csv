0,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
1,"Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
2,"The economy is very strong, and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
3,"Economic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
4,The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year.
5,"Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth."
6,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024."
7,"Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs."
8,"In February, the March 16, 2022 unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
9,"Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
10,"FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and remaining near that level thereafter."
11,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
12,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
13,"These supply disruptions have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
14,"Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation."
15,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home.
16,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
17,We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.
18,"As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
19,"That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price-stability goal than previously expected."
20,"The median inflation March 16, 2022 projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside."
21,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
22,Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
23,"In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability."
24,"In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains—which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade March 16, 2022 and other channels."
25,Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
26,We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.
27,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
28,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
29,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
30,"Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices."
31,"I don’t think—I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there."
32,"But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth."
33,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth."
34,"So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth."
35,"I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year."
36,"So now we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short-term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices."
37,So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.
38,"But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year."
39,We expect growth to continue.
40,As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.
41,"And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’s meeting, I saw a Committee that’s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that."
42,"But if you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint."
43,But we do know that we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.
44,"So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include, potentially, the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certainly base effects."
45,"You’re lapping—as you know, when you look at a 12-month trailing window, you’re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year."
46,"Really what we’re looking for, though, is month-by-month inflation coming down."
47,"You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course."
48,"The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now."
49,We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL improvement on inflation.
50,We’ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement.
51,"And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ll do so."
52,"And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet."
53,"We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market."
54,"We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that’s part of what’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis."
55,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services."
56,"So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so."
57,"But if you look, people do have their in—by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate."
58,"So that should stop pushing—that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically."
59,"One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight."
60,"But this is—clearly, what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that, the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they’re pushing up inflation anymore."
61,"And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down."
62,"But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched."
63,"So, in principle, if you were—let’s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market."
64,"And, basically, across the economy, we’d like to slow demand so that it’s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand."
65,"And that, over time, should bring inflation down."
66,"And I’ll say again, though, you know, we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability."
67,"You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there—you really can’t have a sustained period of maximum employment."
68,"It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability."
69,"Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
70,But we have to restore price stability.
71,"And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk."
72,"But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well."
73,"It’s not the only thing we’re looking for, though, from inflation."
74,"And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic."
75,"And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels."
76,"And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy."
77,And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates.
78,"What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don’t see inflation, then we’re not going to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation."
79,"There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates."
80,The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
81,"It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation."
82,"Yes, there are threats to growth March 16, 2022 from, you know, from what’s going on in Eastern Europe."
83,"And, but, nonetheless, in the base Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL case, there’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth."
84,But inflation is far above our target.
85,"And so we’re looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we’re committed to doing that."
86,"The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
87,"But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal."
88,"We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market."
89,"But we do understand also that, really, you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability."
90,"So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong."
91,We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.
92,So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.
93,"We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people’s well-being."
94,"And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone."
95,"But it’s really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I mean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to absorb some inflation."
96,"If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up."
97,"But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier."
98,"It may take longer than we like, but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down."
99,"So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy."
100,"And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply."
101,And that brings—that will bring inflation down over time.
102,"I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it’s our obligation to restore price stability."
103,"And, you know, we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted."
104,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.
105,"And, you know, we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which—our target is 2 percent inflation."
106,"And I just would want people to understand that, and that’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet."
107,"And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity."
108,"And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases."
109,"Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong."
110,"If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output."
111,"But we do believe that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation."
112,So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.
113,"And when that happens, prices go up."
114,And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.
115,"And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity."
116,"But right now, they’re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time."
117,"But it comes back to, you know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply, March 16, 2022 particularly in the labor market."
118,And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.
119,"And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
120,"We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy."
121,"But, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it’s good to see that moving up."
122,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.
123,"So I think if we March 16, 2022 knew now—of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages, really, and the inflation Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes."
124,We’re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market.
125,"And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that."
126,We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched.
127,"No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down."
128,"And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate."
