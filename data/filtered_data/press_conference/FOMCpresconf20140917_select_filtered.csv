0,"The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its meeting earlier today and, as usual, released its monetary policy statement."
1,The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.
2,The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.
3,"Although the pace of job growth has slowed some recently, job gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month over the past three months."
4,"The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at the time of the June FOMC meeting."
5,These developments continue the trend of gradual progress toward our employment objective.
6,"Indeed, private domestic final demand—that is, spending by domestic households and businesses—grew about twice as fast as GDP."
7,"Indicators of spending and production for the third quarter suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward."
8,"Inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, but with longer-term inflation expectations appearing to be well anchored and the economic recovery continuing, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective."
9,"Moreover, inflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Committee believes that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished."
10,"As is always the case, the Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
11,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
12,The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the June projections and now stands at 5.9 to 6.0 percent at the end of this year.
13,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level over the course of 2016 and edging a bit below that level in 2017.
14,"The central tendency of September 17, 2014 the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL projections."
15,"Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth."
16,"Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent."
17,"The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
18,"Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired without additional policy accommodation."
19,The intent of the program was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.
20,"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the program, and with the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset purchases again at this meeting."
21,"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in the labor market and inflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting."
22,"The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial September 17, 2014 conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL inflation of 2 percent."
23,"Regarding interest rates, the Committee reaffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
24,"Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
25,"Notably, although the central tendency of the unemployment rate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a percentage point below the longer-run value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants."
26,"Although FOMC participants provide a number September 17, 2014 of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its longer-run normal level at that time, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are likely to continue to restrain household spending, constrain credit availability, and depress expectations for future growth in output and incomes."
27,"If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged."
28,Let me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” This statement is intended to provide information to the public about the eventual normalization process; it does not signal a change in the current or future stance of monetary policy.
29,"As is always the case in setting policy, the FOMC will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
30,"Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation using nontraditional tools of monetary policy."
31,"As was the case before the crisis, the Committee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily through actions that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates, not through active management of the balance sheet."
32,"It’s the Committee’s intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these securities will primarily consist of Treasury securities."
33,"As I stated earlier, today’s release of the Committee’s updated normalization plans is in no way intended to signal a change in the stance of monetary policy."
34,This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
35,"So the outlook is little changed—a slight decline in the anticipated path of the unemployment rate and a very slight uptick in the inflation projection, but really quite minimal."
36,"It has said that it will be looking at the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and inflation, and our goals for those variables, are closing."
37,And then what the Committee does at each meeting is—after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the implications of its view of the data at that time.
38,"The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective."
39,"Well, the growth projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower."
40,"So while the projected path of the labor market—unemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on the growth outlook."
41,"And the Committee assesses that the labor market is continuing to improve, and you see a small reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period."
42,"But, as a guess, I would hazard—first, I would say, there is relatively little upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very slight upward change in the projection for inflation."
43,"So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between performance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change."
44,"Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five years."
45,"And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most September 17, 2014 FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent."
46,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.
47,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors."
48,"Market participants, understanding that there are a range of possible outcomes, with upside and downside possibilities, are doing something slightly different, I think, when they’re determining market prices."
49,"They are taking into account the possibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including—even if they’re not very likely—ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth and the appropriate path of rates will be low."
50,"So, I think the Committee would—will be focused on—we intend to use the path of short-term interest rates as our key tool of policy."
51,"And, of course, market participants will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when that time comes."
52,"We have been at zero for a very long time and below the levels that some common policy rules would now be suggesting, given the level of unemployment and inflation."
53,"And once we decide it’s appropriate to begin to normalize policy and to raise the level of our target for September 17, 2014 short-term interest rates, it would still take some time for rates to get back to levels—you can see Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL in our projection that by the end of 2017, the participants are, on average, projecting that rates will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run."
54,"I think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial stability concerns."
55,"So there’s been a little bit of downgrading, I think, even this time in the longer-run normal growth rates that Committee participants have written down."
56,"You are certainly right in saying that over a number of years now, there’s been a pattern of forecast errors in which either we’ve been on track with respect to unemployment or unemployment has come down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been surprising the Committee to the downside."
57,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing."
58,"So we have had downward revisions in the level of potential output and to some extent, at least for a time, in the projected pace of growth."
59,There are a range of views about long-run growth.
60,"Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have discussed the outlook for Europe—the very low level of inflation that they have seen recently and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectations, in the slow pace of growth."
61,"It is one of a number of risks to the global economy, and we certainly hope that they will be successful in seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global economy and the United States."
62,"They want to make sure that if progress really does turn out to be faster than we have—we would expect, that the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy."
63,"So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think are normal longer-run levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016."
64,"But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulting from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating—an example would be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit."
65,"In addition, we have had slow productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment spending."
