0,"As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC “reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.” The Committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, indicating that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.” This new language does not represent a change in our policy intentions and is fully consistent with our previous guidance, which stated that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the end of our asset purchase program."
1,"In the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment."
2,"The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly 280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month."
3,"The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, three-tenths lower than the latest reading available at the time of the September FOMC meeting."
4,"Smoothing through the quarterly ups and downs earlier this year, real GDP expanded around 2½ percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, and the available indicators suggest that economic growth is running at roughly that pace in the current quarter."
5,The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward.
6,"Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the recent sizable declines in oil prices will likely hold down overall inflation in the near term."
7,"But as the effects of these oil price declines and other transitory factors dissipate and as resource utilization continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective."
8,"In making this forecast, the Committee is mindful of the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation."
9,"At this point, the Committee views these movements as likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
10,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
11,"The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the September projections and now stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line with its estimated longer-run normal level."
12,"Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further over December 17, 2014 the course of 2016 and 2017."
13,"The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections."
14,"Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth."
15,"Finally, although FOMC participants project inflation in the near term to be lower on account of the decline in energy prices, they continue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent."
16,"The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next year, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
17,"As I noted earlier, the Committee “reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.” Regarding forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of our asset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal."
18,"Today’s statement, which indicates that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,” does not signify any change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements."
19,"As before, this judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
20,"Employment is rising at a healthy rate and the U.S. economy is strengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
21,"Of course, inflation has been running somewhat below our goal of 2 percent, but we project that gap to close gradually over time."
22,"As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation."
23,"If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated."
24,"Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it continues to be the Committee’s assessment that, “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy given by FOMC participants."
25,"By the time December 17, 2014 of liftoff, participants expect to see some further decline in the unemployment rate and additional Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL improvement in labor market conditions."
26,They also expect core inflation to be running near current levels but foresee being reasonably confident in their expectation that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective over time.
27,"By late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains more than 1 percentage point below the longer-run value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below its estimated longer-run value and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective."
28,The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
29,"You asked also, I think, about inflation."
30,"And, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflation that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import prices, we certainly expect headline inflation to December 17, 2014 be under downward pressure for a while."
31,And they do largely expect that inflation will be—core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.
32,And headline inflation could even be lower.
33,"And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that’s likely to occur."
34,The very substantial decline we have seen in oil prices is one of the most important developments shaping the global outlook.
35,"I think the judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S. outlook, that the decline we have seen in oil prices is likely to be, on net, a positive."
36,"With respect to deflation, we see downward pressure on headline inflation from declining energy prices."
37,"We certainly recognize that that is going to be pushing down headline inflation and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation."
38,"But, at this point, although we indicated we’re monitoring inflation developments carefully, we see these developments as transitory."
39,"And the Committee continues to believe—especially with the improvement we’re seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue—that inflation will move back up to our December 17, 2014 2 percent objective over time."
40,"But other alternatives, I think, are priced into the market."
41,And one reason that the market prices may be different than the Committee’s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast.
42,"There are a number of different factors that are bearing on the path of market interest rates, I think, including global economic developments."
43,"It is often the case that when oil prices move down and the dollar appreciates, that that tends to put downward pressure on inflation compensation and on longer-term rates."
44,"Well I—I’d say, you know, that I think what we have seen since the mid-’80s is that, in an environment where inflation expectations are well anchored, that movements in oil and commodity prices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the inflation outlook."
45,"There were many years in which we had unanticipated increases in oil prices, really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upward pressure on headline inflation and sometimes even spilled through into core, and, typically, the Committee looked through those impacts on inflation with the view that they would be transitory."
46,"Inflation, even core inflation, has been running below our inflation objective."
47,"Movements in oil, you know, now down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation."
48,"So as long as participants December 17, 2014 feel reasonably confident that the inflation projection is one where we expect to meet our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective over time, that’s what I think how they’ll be looking at things as we decide on the path for the funds rate."
49,"And with respect to inflation—our forecast for inflation and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it’s important that monetary policy be forward looking."
50,"The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future."
51,"Typically, we have seen that as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, that as the labor market recovers, we’ll gradually see upward pressure on both wages and prices, and that inflation will tend to move back toward 2 percent."
52,"I think historically we have seen, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gradually rise over time."
53,"So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like."
54,"And I really don’t have much for you other than to say that they will be data dependent—that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a track where we see continuing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability."
55,We are providing a very highly accommodative monetary policy.
56,"And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary policy, when that becomes appropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will still be very accommodative for a long time."
57,"And, I think, in part, the reason for that is that inflation is running below our objective, and the Committee wants to see inflation move back toward our objective over time."
58,And a short period of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below the natural rate will facilitate a slightly faster return of inflation to our objective.
59,"It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation where there is great uncertainty about exactly what constitutes maximum employment or a longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
60,We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.
61,"The standard unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has been signaling a little bit less slack in the labor market than measures that are somewhat broader that, for example, include the unusually large number of people who were part-time employed but would prefer full-time jobs."
62,"And so it may be that with a very small undershoot of this longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate, as measured by the standard unemployment rate, we’ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack."
63,But it’s important to point out that the Committee is not anticipating an overshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective.
64,"Well, what I would say, we refer to this in the statement as “inflation compensation” rather than “inflation expectations.” The gap between the nominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for example, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation compensation."
65,"That could reflect a change in inflation expectations, but it could also reflect changes in assessment of inflation risks."
66,"The risk premium that’s necessary to compensate for inflation, that might especially have fallen if the probabilities attached to very high inflation have come down."
67,So I think the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward move in inflation compensation.
68,And we indicated that we are monitoring inflation developments carefully.
69,"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent."
70,"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them."
71,"They see the longer-run normal level of interest rates as December 17, 2014 around 3¾ percent."
72,So there’s no view in the Committee that there is secular stagnation in the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL sense that we won’t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates.
73,"But they have said, it’ll, you know, the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of monetary policy accommodation; we expect to be able to normalize policy."
74,"But, until those conditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, monetary policy will need to stay accommodative."
75,"So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us important tasks in monetary policy and in other roles that we perform, and the Federal Reserve is highly focused on attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy."
76,"It’s our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re working on."
77,"You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about monetary policy that it regards as in the best longer-run interests of the economy, free of short-run political interference, is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy."
78,"So I do think central bank independence is very important, and that it’s important to make sure that we can make the decisions we think are best, free of short-run political interference with respect to monetary policy."
79,"Back in 1978, Congress explicitly passed legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking— namely, policy audits."
80,"Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the decline in oil prices, and the ruble has depreciated enormously in value, and this is posing a series of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy."
81,"I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield bonds, where there’s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or a decline in their earnings, and we have seen some increase in spreads on high-yield bonds more generally."
82,But the movements in oil prices have been very large and undoubtedly unexpected.
83,"We—in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by movements in oil prices, leverage in the financial system, in general, is way down from the levels before the crisis."
84,There have been large and unexpected movements in oil prices.
85,"So I agree, and that’s why we stated that we typically think of the monetary policy impact of our asset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we’re reminding the public that we continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in longer-term yields."
86,"Rather than actively planning to sell the assets that we’ve put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we begin raising our targets for short-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial conditions, we’re likely to reduce or cease reinvestment and gradually run down the stock of our December 17, 2014 assets."
87,"But our active tool for adjusting monetary—the stance of monetary policy so that it is Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL appropriate for the economic needs for the country, that will be done through adjusting our short-term target range for the federal funds rate."
