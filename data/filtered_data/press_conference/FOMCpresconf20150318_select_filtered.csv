0,"Moreover, even after the initial increase in the target funds rate, our policy is likely to remain highly accommodative to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
1,We have seen continued progress toward our objective of maximum employment.
2,"The pace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains averaging nearly 290,000 per month over the past three months."
3,The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in February; that’s three-tenths lower than the latest reading available at the time of our December meeting.
4,Broader measures of job market conditions—such as those counting individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time—have shown similar improvement.
5,"Meanwhile, the labor force Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL participation rate—the percentage of working-age Americans either working or seeking work—is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists."
6,We continue to expect sufficient underlying strength in economic growth to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.
7,"After averaging about 2½ percent over 2014, growth of real gross domestic product appears to have slowed in the first quarter of this year, in part reflecting a moderation in household spending."
8,"In addition, the recovery in the housing sector remains subdued, and export growth looks to have weakened."
9,"Looking ahead, however, the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of GDP growth, with robust job gains and lower energy prices supporting household spending."
10,"Inflation has declined further below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower energy prices I just mentioned."
11,"Declining import prices have also restrained inflation, and in light of the recent appreciation of the dollar, will likely continue to do so in the months ahead."
12,"My colleagues and I continue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term."
13,"In making this forecast, we are attentive to the low levels of market-based measures of inflation compensation."
14,"In contrast, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
15,The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
16,"As always, each participant’s projections March 18, 2015 are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
17,The unemployment rate Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL projections over the next few years and in the longer run are generally a bit lower than the December projections.
18,"At the end of this year, the central tendency for the unemployment rate stands at 5 to 5.2 percent, in line with participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
19,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.
20,"For economic growth, participants generally reduced their projections since December, with many citing a weaker outlook for net exports."
21,"Nonetheless, the central tendency of the growth projections for this year and next, at 2.3 to 2.7 percent, remains somewhat above estimates of the longer-run normal growth rate."
22,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and import prices."
23,"The central tendency of the inflation projections for this year is now below 1 percent, down noticeably since December."
24,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate, the central tendency rebounds to 1.7 to 1.9 percent next year and rises to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
25,"Returning to monetary policy, as I noted at the outset, the Committee reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
26,"In December and January, the Committee judged that it could be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
27,"As we noted in our statement, the decision to raise the target range will depend on our assessment of realized and expected progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
28,"We continue to base that assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
29,We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
30,"Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, we continue to expect that—in the words of our statement—“even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy reported by FOMC participants."
31,"Compared with the projections made in December, most participants lowered their path for the federal funds rate, consistent with the downward revisions made to the projections for GDP growth and inflation as well as somewhat lower estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
32,"The median projected rate in 2017 remains Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL below the 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants as the rate’s longer-run value, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below that of its estimated longer-run value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective."
33,"I would like to emphasize that these forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are conditional on participants’ individual projections for economic output, inflation, and other factors."
34,"Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep."
35,"Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaining to the first quarter, that real GDP growth has declined somewhat below where it was for the last several quarters of last year."
36,And that’s really why the Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.
37,There has been a slight downgrading of estimates of growth for this year.
38,We noted that export growth has weakened.
39,"The strength of the dollar is also one factor that, as I noted, is holding down import prices and, at least on a transitory basis at this point, pushing inflation down."
40,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here."
41,"Taking everything into account, we continue to project above-trend growth."
42,"The central tendency of the participants is, they’re looking for an unemployment rate that will be down to 5.0 to 5.2, which is consistent with their estimates of its longer-run normal value."
43,"And a stronger labor market with less labor market slack is one factor that would tend to, certainly for me, increase my confidence that as slack diminishes, that inflation will move up over time."
44,"Other things I will be looking at—of course, the inflation data, but as we said, we expect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines and the dollar."
45,"But we will be looking at the inflation data carefully to see if we can interpret, for example, low levels of inflation—if we see that, which we expect, as reflecting those influences."
46,We will be looking at wage growth.
47,We have not seen wage growth pick up.
48,"We may not see wage growth pick up, I wouldn’t say either that that is a precondition to raising rates."
49,"But if we did see wage growth pick up, that would be at least a symptom that inflation would likely move up over time."
50,We’ll be watching inflation expectations.
51,And market-based measures of inflation compensation have fallen.
52,"For one thing, you do see meaningful downward adjustment in the inflation forecast, certainly for this year."
53,"In addition, importantly, a number of participants have marked down their estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate."
54,And downward revisions to the longer-run normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more slack in the economy now than they previously did.
55,"If there are adverse shocks to demand that tend to push inflation and economic performance in an adverse direction, it’s not possible to lower rates."
56,"So, in terms of certainty and providing metrics, we provided a metric or a threshold of 6½ percent several years ago and told market participants and the public that we wouldn’t consider it appropriate to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than that level, as long as inflation was well contained."
57,"We need to see, as we have said, we want to see further improvement in the labor market, and we want to feel reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective."
58,"And the mean—often the mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation, so they seem to be biased."
59,"Nevertheless, they do seem to be useful in predicting actual movements in inflation."
60,"And because we think inflation expectations are a determinant of price setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, even if it’s imperfect, in trying to gauge inflation expectations."
61,"Now, the fact that survey measures are stable, even if they are stable at levels consistent with inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve, that’s not a guarantee that inflation March 18, 2015 will, over time, move to be consistent with those expectations."
62,"An example is Japan, I would Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL give you, where for many years the households and businesses expected positive inflation but there was a consistent undershoot."
63,We also look at measures of inflation expectations based on market differentials between nominal and real or TIPS yields.
64,"They’re also informative but can move around for reasons pertaining to liquidity in the Treasury market and in the TIPS market, and also because of changing perceptions of inflation risk."
65,"And in addition to looking at asset valuations, we also look at measures of credit growth, of the extent of leverage being used in the economy and in the financial sector, and the extent of maturity transformation."
66,"We provide an immense amount of information, both financial—about our balance sheet—and our monetary policy operations."
67,"With respect to congressional changes that are under consideration that would politicize monetary policy by bringing Congress in to make policy judgments about, in real-time, on our monetary policy decisions."
68,"Congress itself decided in 1978 that that was a bad thing to do, that it would lead to poor economic performance, and they carved out this one area of policy reviews, March 18, 2015 of monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits."
69,The global experience shows that giving central banks independence to make monetary policy decisions that they think are in the best interest of the country and consistent with their mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic outcomes.
70,"Of course, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed’s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere."
71,"With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and long have—as a kind of benchmark for thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of policy."
72,"But to chain a central bank to follow a simple mathematical rule that fails to take account of many things that are very important in making monetary policy—for example, I was earlier asked about being against the zero lower bound, which is an important special consideration—that would be a very foolish thing to do, and I oppose it."
73,"But, remember, we have to put that in context: There are a lot of things that affect the U.S. outlook, and while that is serving as a drag on economic growth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient strength—particularly in private spending—that we are expecting above-trend growth, even so."
74,"We have pledged to communicate as clearly as we can about monetary policy, and I am trying to do that, and will continue to do so."
75,"Many, many studies over decades and decades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary policy affects the economy, and, therefore, monetary policy does have to be forward looking."
76,"In spite of the fact that they are projecting that inflation will be low, they’re looking forward and they see that, by the end of 2016 or 2017, with the labor market recovering, and assuming that inflation expectations remain stable and transitory influences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation heading back to our 2 percent objective."
77,"We said we would do that when economic conditions were appropriate after we begin raising rates, because we want changes in the—our target range for the federal funds rate to be the main tool by which we shift the stance of monetary policy."
78,A positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is that the labor market has improved more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of economic growth.
79,"So the unemployment rate has come down more rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected."
80,"I would expect it to pick up, and as you can see Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above current levels."
81,"But it means it’s something that would, if it persists, retard living standards and would likely retard real wage growth and improvement in living standards for ordinary households."
