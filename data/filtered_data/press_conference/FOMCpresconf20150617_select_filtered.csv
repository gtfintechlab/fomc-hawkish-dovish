0,"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, but some of the downward pressure on inflation resulting from earlier sharp declines in energy prices is abating."
1,The Committee continues to judge that the first increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
2,Let me emphasize that the importance of the initial increase should not be overstated: The stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the initial increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
3,"Growth in household spending slowed, business fixed investment edged down, and net exports were a substantial drag on growth."
4,"Looking ahead, the Committee still expects a moderate pace of GDP growth, with Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL continuing job gains and lower energy prices supporting household spending."
5,"The labor market data so far this year have shown further progress toward our objective of maximum employment, although at a slower pace than late last year."
6,"Over the past three months, job gains have averaged about 210,000 per month, down from an average pace of 280,000 per month over the second half of last year, but still well above the pace consistent with trend labor force growth."
7,"Although the unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in May, was unchanged from the latest reading available at the time of our April meeting, the labor force participation rate edged up."
8,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time has continued to improve.
9,"But it seems likely that some cyclical weakness in the labor market remains: The participation rate remains below most estimates of its underlying trend, involuntary part-time employment remains elevated, and wage growth remains relatively subdued."
10,"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices."
11,Declines in import prices have also restrained inflation.
12,"However, energy prices appear to have stabilized recently."
13,"My colleagues and I continue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves further, inflation will gradually move back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term."
14,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, though they have risen some from their levels earlier this year, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
15,The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
16,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
17,"For economic growth, participants reduced their projections for this year, in line with the disappointing data for the first quarter."
18,"The central tendency of the growth projections for 2015 is now 1.8 to 2.0 percent, down a little more than ½ percentage point from the March projections."
19,"The central tendency rises to 2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the longer-run growth rate."
20,The unemployment rate projections for this year are a little higher than in March.
21,"At the end of this year, the central tendency for the unemployment rate stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent, a bit above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
22,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.
23,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and non-energy import prices."
24,"The central tendency of the inflation projections for this year is below 1 percent, unchanged since March."
25,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate, the central tendency rises to 1.6 to 1.9 percent next year and to 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
26,"Returning to monetary policy, as I noted, the Committee reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
27,"As we said in our statement, the decision to raise the target range will depend on our assessment of realized and expected progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
28,"We continue to base that assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
29,"And we continue to anticipate that it will be June 17, 2015 appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
30,"While the Committee views the disappointing economic performance in the first quarter as largely transitory, my colleagues and I would like to see more decisive evidence that a moderate pace of economic growth will be sustained, so that conditions in the labor market will continue to improve and inflation will move back to 2 percent."
31,"Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, we continue to expect that—as we say in our statement—“even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” In other words, although policy will be data dependent, economic conditions are currently anticipated to evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the target federal funds rate."
32,"Compared with the projections made in March, most FOMC participants lowered somewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, consistent with the revisions made to the projections for GDP growth and the unemployment rate."
33,"The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the 3¾ percent or so projected by most FOMC participants as the longer-run value of the federal funds rate even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is June 17, 2015 slightly below its estimated longer-run value and the central tendency for inflation is close to our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective."
34,"I would like to emphasize that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are conditional on participants’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
35,"Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep."
36,"On the one hand, waiting too long to begin normalization can risk significantly overshooting our inflation objective given the lags in the operation of monetary policy."
37,"So I can’t provide you—it would be wrong for me to provide you a roadmap that said something as simple as, if the unemployment rate declines to X, that then the labor market will have improved enough for us to begin to raise policy."
38,"We have to look at what’s happening to labor force participation, to part-time employment for economic reasons, to job openings, to the pace of quits, to wage inflation, and other indicators of the state of the labor market."
39,"I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has diminished to some extent in the intermeeting period, and, clearly, over a longer span of time, over the last several years, obviously we’ve made considerable progress in moving toward our goal of maximum employment."
40,"On inflation, again, there has been some progress, in the sense energy prices appear to have stabilized."
41,"Now, inflation is going to—overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a substantial period of time."
42,"The big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and they’re not going to wash out of the inflation data until late in this year."
43,But the fact that energy prices have stabilized means that the pressure from that source is diminishing.
44,"And, with respect to core inflation, it has been running under our 2 percent objective, but declining import prices have been reducing that pressure."
45,"I believe that as the labor market continues to improve and as our confidence in that forecast rises, at least for me, my confidence will also rise that inflation will move back up toward 2 percent."
46,"I expect that to, over time, put upward pressure on core inflation."
47,"We place high priority on being an accountable and transparent central bank, and I think that if you compare the transparency of monetary policy decisions in the Federal Reserve with other central banks, we are one of the most transparent central banks in terms of the information that we provide to the public in a whole variety of ways."
48,"The last paragraph of the Federal Open Market Committee statement says: “The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” That’s kind of a mouthful."
49,"Now, that assumes, as you can see, that they’re expecting a pickup in growth in the second half of this year and further improvement in labor market conditions."
50,So we are—productivity growth has been—is a factor that affects the pace of improvement in the labor market.
51,"Productivity growth has been extremely slow for the June 17, 2015 last couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improvement in the labor market that we’re Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL projecting reflects the notion that there’s likely to be some pickup in the pace of productivity growth."
52,"Obviously, that’s something that’s quite uncertain, and it’s conceivable that if productivity growth disappoints—something I hope that we won’t see, because that has very negative implications for living standards—we could conceivably see faster improvement in the labor market."
53,"But, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don’t show up in the unemployment rate."
54,"I expect that to continue, and I would expect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employment that’s for economic reasons."
55,So the Committee estimates that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.
56,"At 5.5 percent, where we have an unemployment rate that still exceeds the Committee’s best attempts to estimate what is a normal unemployment rate for this economy, and, as I mentioned, there appear to be unusually large elements of slack over and above that in the form of somewhat still-depressed labor force participation and part-time work June 17, 2015 for economic reasons."
57,"So I think it’s fair to say that most members, most participants on the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL Committee, wouldn’t judge yet—although some might—that most wouldn’t judge us to be at, quote, “maximum employment.” Wage increases are still running at a low level, but there have been some tentative signs that wage growth is picking up."
58,We have seen an increase in the growth rate of the employment cost index and a mild uptick in the growth of average hourly earnings.
59,I would call these tentative signs of stronger wage growth.
60,"Still, however, inflation—not only headline, but, stripping out food and energy underlying inflation, core inflation—is still running below the Committee’s objective."
61,"So I think we need to see additional strength in the labor market and the economy moving somewhat closer to capacity—the output gap shrinking—in order to have confidence that inflation will move back up to 2 percent, but we have made some progress."
62,"Well, I mean, the house—the increase in house prices is restoring wealth of many households who have that as their major asset."
63,"And for all of the households that were underwater, those house price increases are improving their financial condition, although, of course, at the same time, it’s making housing less affordable for those who look to buy."
64,"Anyone who doesn’t have a pristine credit rating is—finds it very difficult at this point to qualify for a mortgage, and I think we’re seeing quite a bit of reluctance, given the job market and given what the history of what’s happened to house prices, of young people to want to buy homes."
65,"So the demand for multifamily housing to rent is very high, and rent prices are moving up, I think, because of that."
66,There are questions at this point about just how much impact we’ve seen of lower energy prices on consumer spending.
67,"The decline in oil prices translates into an improvement in household income, on average, of something like $700 per household, and I’m not convinced yet by the data that we have seen the kind of response to that that I would ultimately expect."
68,We—our charge from Congress is to pursue the goals of maximum employment and price stability.
69,"And obviously there are benefits from a strong economy to every household in the economy, including savers, from having a better job market and a more secure economy."
70,"I can’t give an ironclad promise, but I think it’s clear from our Summary of Economic Projections that we anticipate that the economy will grow, that the labor market will improve, that inflation will move back up to 2 percent as we—is our objective over the medium term."
71,"With respect to market reactions, we always, in evaluating the economic outlook, have to take account of financial conditions, whether it’s the level of long-term interest rates or the value of the dollar in assessing the economic outlook."
72,"In addition, import prices for non-oil imports continue to fall, and I think that’s serving to push down core inflation a little bit."
