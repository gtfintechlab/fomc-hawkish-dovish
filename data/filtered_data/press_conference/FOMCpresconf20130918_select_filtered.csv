0,"Economic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace, with continued—albeit somewhat uneven—improvement in labor market conditions."
1,"Of course, to say that the job market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory."
2,"Notably, at 7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels."
3,Long-term unemployment and underemployment remain high.
4,"In the Committee’s assessment, the downside risks to growth have diminished, on net, over the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of households and firms in the staying power of the U.S. recovery."
5,"In addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk."
6,"Apart from some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective."
7,"The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
8,"However, the unwinding of some transitory factors has led to moderately higher inflation recently, as expected."
9,"And, with longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, the Committee anticipates that inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent."
10,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
11,"Generally, the projections of individual participants show that they continue to expect moderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards levels of unemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
12,"More specifically, participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016."
13,"For the unemployment rate, the central tendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, declining to 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014 and, by 2016, to 5.4 to 5.9 percent—about the longer-run normal level for the unemployment rate."
14,Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.
15,"The central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016."
16,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies."
17,"As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering its target for the short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate."
18,"We stated that, subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program, purchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
19,"As I noted earlier, conditions in the job market today are still far from what all of us would like to see."
20,"For example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent at the time of our announcement to 7.3 percent today, and about 2.3 million private-sector jobs have been created over the same period."
21,"Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly new claims for unemployment insurance have fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that households perceive jobs as more readily available."
22,"Importantly, these gains were achieved despite substantial fiscal headwinds, which are likely slowing economic growth this year by a percentage point, or more, and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs."
23,"However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook—in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee’s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards its 2 percent objective over time."
24,"At the meeting concluded earlier today, the sense of the Committee was that the broad contours of the medium-term economic outlook—including economic growth sufficient to support ongoing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving towards its objective—were close to the views it held in June."
25,"Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further."
26,"As noted in today’s statement, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back towards its longer-run objective."
27,"The Committee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved as described in our statement."
28,"For example, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but would, instead, indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase."
29,"The Committee would be unlikely to increase rates if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for some time, for example; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into account additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains."
30,"Thus, the first increases in short-term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 6½ percent."
31,"Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6½ percent, 12 of the 17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in 2016."
32,"And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer-run normal values for those variables, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 is 2 percent, well below the longer-run normal value for the federal funds rate of 4 percent or so projected by most participants."
33,"Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery will abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patient policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate below its longer-run normal value for some time."
34,"Let me close by noting that although the FOMC is employing two instruments of policy—asset purchases and forward guidance about short-term interest rates—the overall stance of monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation."
35,"Our program of asset purchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was initiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion."
36,"However, even after asset purchases are wound down—which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data—the Federal Reserve’s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings of securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
37,"So, I think there is a cyclical component to participation, and, in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment, if you will, in the economy."
38,"Over the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight-tenths of a percentage point."
39,"So, in other words, I think it would be fair to say that most of the improvement in the unemployment rate—not all, but most of it in the last year—is due to job creation rather than lower participation."
40,"I would also note that if you look at the broader measures of unemployment that the BLS publishes, including part-time work, including discouraged workers and so on, you’ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as the overall standard civilian unemployment rate."
41,"But I also would agree with you that the unemployment rate, while perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor market, is not by itself a fully representative indicator."
42,"So to answer the first part of your question, I think there’s no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible, and that’s what we tried to do."
43,"We have a three-part baseline projection, which involves increasing growth that’s picking up over time as fiscal drag is reduced, continuing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving back towards objective."
44,"And, secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal tool of monetary policy, it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide the support necessary for our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens."
45,"But, as my first answer suggested, the unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in all circumstances, of the state of the labor market overall."
46,"For example, just last month, the decline in the unemployment rate came about more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs."
47,"So what we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment rate, but including other factors as well."
48,"I hope to have more information for you at some reasonably soon date, but today I want to focus on monetary policy."
49,"Part of it reflects views about monetary policy, and that we want to make sure we get straight."
50,"I think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and levered positions in the markets, and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that those unwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred."
51,"Let me first restate the—I think the key point here, which is that the large majority of the participants of the FOMC, including voting and nonvoting members who are asked to describe their own assessment of optimal policy—the large majority of them estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 2 percent, even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment, according to our best projections."
52,"And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using rates lower than, sort of, the long-run normal."
53,"So, in other words, in economics terms, the equilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time because of these headwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth."
54,"So that’s why we expect to see growth that—I mean, rates at an unusually low level."
55,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth."
56,"One reason for it, though, is that it appears—and I talked about this in a speech last year—it appears that, as part of the aftermath of the financial crisis, that, at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the economy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at the same rate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is slower, et cetera."
57,"So it appears, again, that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been slowed somewhat, at least temporarily, by the recession and the financial crisis, and you can see that in the slower productivity figures."
58,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth."
59,"Now, it’s important to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long-run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and employment from its normal level."
60,"Our predictions of unemployment, for example, have been better than our predictions of growth."
61,"And, in particular, one thing that’s been quite striking is that unemployment—we were too pessimistic on unemployment for this year."
62,Unemployment has fallen faster than we anticipated.
63,"We’re looking, again, to see confirmation of our broader scenario, which basically is that we’ll continue to see progress in the labor market, that growth will be sufficient to support that progress, and that inflation will be moving back towards target, and that’s what will determine our policy decisions."
64,"So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’re seeing interest rate projections and inflation projections separately."
65,"I think you’re right, I mean, that we should be very reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target, and that’s one of the reasons that I think we can be very patient in raising the federal funds rate since we have not seen any inflation pressure."
66,"On having an inflation floor, that would be in addition to the guidance."
67,"And, of course, implicit in our policy strategy is trying to reach that target for inflation, but that—an inflation floor is certainly something that, you know, could be a sensible modification or addition to the guidance."
68,"And our assessment of the data since June is that, taken collectively, that it didn’t quite meet the standard of satisfying our—or of ratifying or confirming our basic outlook for, again, increasing growth, improving labor markets, and inflation moving back towards target."
69,"You know, I think we did what we could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated entirely by the interest of the broader public, that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so that it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more—that would have been even more severe by many times than what we actually saw."
70,"And that these policies have been successful in strengthening financial conditions, lowering interest rates, and thereby promoting recovery."
71,"And, importantly—as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement—that happened notwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and 1½ percentage points of real growth and hundreds of thousands of jobs."
72,"So the fact that we have maintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year, notwithstanding this fiscal drag, is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from monetary policy."
73,"Now, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can’t address."
74,"The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth."
75,"And when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full employment that rate policy will be sufficient, I think that we will still be able to provide—even if asset purchases are reduced—we will still be able to provide a highly accommodative monetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full employment."
76,"I won’t overstate it, but we do want to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy, particularly in mortgage rates, on housing."
77,"But we have developed a variety of tools, and we think we have numerous tools that we—can be used to both manage interest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes."
78,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period."
79,"For example, Mr. Ip mentioned an inflation floor."
80,"The Federal Reserve is—we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American, because one of our principal goals—we have two principal goals, one is maximum employment, jobs."
81,The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities.
82,"We’re still not satisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is."
83,"And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of course, also helps make the economy work better for people in the middle and the lower parts of the distribution."
84,"It would be better to have a mix of tools at work—not just monetary policy, but fiscal policy and other policies as well."
85,"Again, our objective—our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite consistent with helping the average American, but there’s limits to what we can do about long-run trends, and I think those are very important issues that Congress and the Administration, you know, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there."
86,"Let me just first say that we have a lot of economists who spend all of their time looking at international aspects of monetary policy, and we spend a lot of time looking at emerging markets."
87,"It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows."
88,"Those include changes in risk preference by investors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within emerging markets across different countries."
89,"The main point, I guess, I would end with, though, is that what we’re trying to do with our monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize, is trying to create a stronger U.S. economy."
