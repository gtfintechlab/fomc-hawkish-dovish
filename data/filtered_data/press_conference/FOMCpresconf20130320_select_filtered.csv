2,"However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated."
3,The Committee also remains concerned that restrictive fiscal policies may slow economic growth and job creation in coming months.
4,"We continue to monitor the recent increases in gasoline prices, which appear to be due mostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance."
5,"Apart from temporary variations in energy prices, inflation is running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent."
6,"Importantly, longer-term inflation expectations remain stable."
7,"Overall, still-high unemployment, in combination with relatively low inflation, underscores the need for policies that will support progress towards maximum employment in a context of price stability."
8,"March 20, 2013 As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy."
9,"To summarize, the participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent in 2015."

11,Most participants see inflation gradually increasing toward the Committee’s longer-run target; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.
12,"Although estimates of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases—by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates—continue to provide meaningful support to economic growth and job creation."
13,"It bears emphasizing that the Committee has described this program in terms of a monthly pace of purchases, rather than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tied the evolution of the program to economic criteria—specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
14,"Second, the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and reaffirmed its expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
15,"In particular, we anticipate that this exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
16,"This guidance will help market participants assess how the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is likely to respond to economic developments, but its broader purpose is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up."

22,"I would say that we’ll be looking for sustained March 20, 2013 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including, obviously, payrolls, Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on."
23,And since we’re looking at the outlook—we’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market— we’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there’s sufficient momentum in the economy to provide demand for labor going forward.
24,"Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by “substantial improvement,” it’s a broad-based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and labor demand."

32,"Clearly, financial instability, if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious, would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs, and a threat to production."
33,That does have some effect on monetary policy.
34,"I would say one thing, which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up."
35,"So, to some extent, not—I don’t want to overstate it—but to some extent, monetary policy—by strengthening the housing market, helping support house prices—is bringing more people into the mortgage market."
36,We’re not targeting asset prices.
37,"We’re measuring success in terms of our mandate, which is employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve."

40,"And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures, including the fiscal cliff deal, the sequester, and other cuts, that federal fiscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant."
41,"That being said, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fiscal restraint of that magnitude, and so the final outcome will be worse—or, in terms of jobs—than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint."
42,"There’s been some disconnect, at least in the short run, between unemployment rate changes and March 20, 2013 growth during this recovery, and there’ve been periods, at least, where unemployment has fallen Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited."
43,You’re right that we’re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.

46,"But you didn’t under the merely adverse scenario, which featured an inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short-term rates."
47,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time."
48,"We could lower even further, say, the unemployment rate number that we hit."
49,"But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approximate the—what’s called the optimal control path of interest rates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that’s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have."

57,"And I think that’s—we’d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned."
58,"But I doubt that, in the near term at least, that we’ll see an increase in labor force participation because—besides the effects of the slow recovery, high unemployment, we’ve had a downward trend in the U.S., which is not due to the recession, it’s due to underlying demographic factors."
59,"Well, I still believe the following, which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument."
60,"If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, you might, at the same time, be throwing the economy into recession, which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy."
61,"And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to affect the way that financial markets respond to monetary policy."
62,"That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ve had—not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years—that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy."
63,"I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low for that purpose, it’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you’re concerned about some sector in the financial sphere."
