0,"At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged."
1,My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2,"Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker."
3,"The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment."
4,"Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed."
5,"Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year."
6,The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
7,"For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization."
8,"But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up."
9,"From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent."
10,"Overall inflation May 1, 2019 fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moves mostly due to changes in energy prices."
11,"As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system."
12,Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.
13,"Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months."
14,"Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective."
15,"At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations."
16,"Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy."
17,"The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy."
18,"In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves."
19,"In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery."
20,"Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate."
21,The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.
22,"So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis."
23,I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.
24,So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.
25,"And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things."
26,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much."
27,"But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy."
28,"That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control."
29,"But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices."
30,"And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so."
31,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.
32,Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.
33,"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there."
34,And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.
35,"If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy."
36,I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.
37,"Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times."
38,"Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going to move around."
39,"So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation May 1, 2019 expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL not been pushed by those other factors."
40,"And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up."
41,Growth is at a healthy level.
42,"Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent."
43,"This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history."
44,"And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent."
45,"We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy."
46,"And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is."
47,"And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments."
48,"So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below."
49,"And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges."
50,"One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower—will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates."
51,"And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem."
52,"Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth."
53,"So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector."
54,"Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year."
55,"And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up."
56,"Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors."
57,"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag."
58,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution."
59,"Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low."
60,"And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned."
61,"So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all."
62,"Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019 very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated."
63,"And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation."
64,"We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective."
65,"Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent."
66,"I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned."
67,And we’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.
68,"We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year."
69,"Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all."
70,It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity.
71,You mentioned productivity.
72,So productivity is really very difficult to predict.
73,"But I will say this: Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years."
74,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher."
75,"Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity."
76,"It suggests that a less tight economy, a less, you know—may be part of the explanation for lower inflation."
