0,The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation in the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
1,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run."
2,These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.
3,"The longer-run projections, shown at the right of each figure, represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy."
4,"The longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent—the same as in our April projections."
5,These projections may be interpreted as indicating participants’ current estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run respectively.
6,"It should be noted that these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision, because longer-run rates of economic growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that often cannot be directly measured."
7,"The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent."
8,"Since the longer-run inflation outlook is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, these projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that each of the participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices."
9,"In effect, the “mandate consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less."
10,"For example, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.3 percentage points since March, and new claims for unemployment insurance have moved somewhat higher."
11,"In particular, consumers’ purchasing power has been damped by higher food and energy prices; and the aftermath of the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan has been associated with disruptions in global supply chains, especially in the auto sector."
12,"However, some moderation in gasoline prices is now in prospect, and the effects of the Japanese disaster on manufacturing output are likely to dissipate in coming months."
13,"Specifically, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of about 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year and 3.3 to 3.7 percent for next year—growth rates faster than we have seen so far in 2011."
14,"However, Committee participants have also generally responded to the recent slowing by marking down the growth projections for 2011 and 2012, which are nearly a half percentage point lower than our April projections."
15,"Looking further ahead, the central tendency of the growth projections for 2012—2013, sorry—is 3.5 to 4.2 percent, essentially the same as in the April projections."
16,"As shown in the second figure, entitled “Unemployment Rate,” the unemployment rate is expected to resume its gradual decline towards levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with this dual mandate."
17,"In particular, the unemployment rate is projected to edge down over coming months to 8.6 to 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then decline gradually over the subsequent two years to a level of 7.0 to 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run unemployment projections."
18,"In short, we expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline, but the pace of progress remains frustratingly slow."
19,"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods."
20,"In addition, prices of motor vehicles have risen notably as a result of the recent supply chain disruptions."
21,"However, as the effects of these factors dissipate, the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside in coming quarters to levels at or below its mandate-consistent rate, as shown in the figure entitled “PCE Inflation.” Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.3 to 2.5 percent for this year but declines to 1.5 to 2.0 percent in both 2012 and 2013—a trajectory that is broadly similar to that of our April projections."
22,"In particular, the Committee’s policy strategy is intended to foster both aspects of our dual mandate—that is, promoting the economic recovery so that the unemployment rate returns over time to its longer-term normal level, and ensuring that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with our mandate."
23,"At 9.1 percent, the current unemployment rate remains elevated, and progress towards more normal levels of unemployment is likely to be slow, as I noted."
24,"Moreover, the inflation rate, which picked up in recent months, is expected to subside to levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit less, that most participants judge to be most consistent with the dual mandate."
25,The ongoing labor market slack and the subdued inflation outlook are key reasons for the Committee’s decision to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation and for our judgment that exceptionally low levels of the funds rate are likely to be warranted for an extended period.
26,We do believe that growth is going to pick up going into 2012 but at a somewhat slower pace from—than we had anticipated in April.
27,We don’t have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting.
28,"You note that, in 2013, we have growth at about the same rate that we anticipated in April."
29,"I think the point I would make, though, in terms of where we are today versus where we were, say, in August of last year when I began to talk about asset purchases, is that at that time, inflation was very low and falling."
30,I don’t think people appreciate necessarily that deflation can be a very pernicious situation where it could have very long-lasting effects on economic growth.
31,"In addition, growth in payrolls has actually picked up."
32,"Inflation was too low and falling, and unemployment looked like it might be even beginning to rise again."
33,"By taking a long-run perspective, we can help the economy by reducing the risk that interest rates might rise suddenly."
34,And so I think it’s very desirable that we take strong action to lower our budget deficits over the longer term.
35,It just is a negative for growth.
36,"I don’t think that sharp, immediate cuts in the deficit would create more jobs."
37,"But by taking a long-run perspective and making a credible plan for reducing future deficits, we’ll lower interest rates, or at least prevent them from rising, and we will increase confidence."
38,"Well, Neil, as you know, I’ve been a long-time proponent of an inflation target."
39,I think that it would help anchor inflation expectations; it would make it easier to reach our inflation objective.
40,"At the same time, it’s not at all inconsistent with our employment objective because keeping inflation low and stable, keeping inflation expectations low and stable, actually gives the Fed more leeway to respond to short-term shocks to the economy."
41,"So, for example, in the European Central Bank, that bank has a mandate for price stability, period."
42,"Without sufficient explanation and background, many people might think that we were somehow abandoning our employment target."
43,"It would have a big impact on credit spreads, on stock prices, and so on."
44,"Moreover, we have worked with—the Federal Reserve has worked actively with the BIS, the Basel Committee, to do analyses of the effects of capital requirements, on the one hand, on the probability of a crisis, and on the other hand, on the cost of lending and the effect on growth."
45,"And if you look at them, you’ll see that we believe that the capital which has been imposed so far would significantly reduce the threat of a massive financial crisis and, on the other hand, have very small effects on growth."
46,"As you saw from the—but as you saw from the projections we just put out, the Committee—every member of the Committee sees the long-run unemployment rate—the NAIRU, as it’s called by economists—somewhere around 5½ percent, basically."
47,"With respect to core inflation, some of the effects, at least there, are also temporary."
48,"To name two examples, the supply chain disruptions brought about by the Japanese disaster have led to a very significant increase in auto prices, both new and used automobiles, last month."
49,As these problems are resolved—and they appear to be very much on the way to being resolved—we would assume that the auto prices would come back down and incentives would be restored as competition increases and costs are reduced.
50,"Another would be the fact that energy prices have passed through to a number of—despite the fact that core is defined excluding energy, that’s only the energy, direct energy products—things like airfares, for example, which are very sensitive to the cost of jet fuel, are also a part of the core."
51,"So you would imagine that, as the price of oil declines, that you would see some bounce—decline in, also in—in the core measures of inflation."
52,"So given that there’s still a large output gap, given that inflation expectations remain well anchored, given that some of the temporary factors affecting inflation, including core inflation, are likely to recede, I think it’s reasonable to think that core inflation will fall back towards mandate-consistent levels."
53,"I think the—I think the thrust of “extended period” is that we believe we’re at least two or three meetings away from taking any further action, and I emphasize “at least.” But depending on how the economy evolves, and inflation and unemployment, it could be, you know, significantly longer."
54,"If we do get both improved job creation and inflation close to our—close to or even above our mandate-consistent level, then that would be a sign that we need to consider beginning an exit process."
55,"Well, if the economy worsens and inflation remains relatively low, then we wouldn’t begin to exit, and, therefore, we wouldn’t change the language."
56,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward."
57,"At the same time, I did—I do think that, given that we can’t explain the entire slowdown, that the best guess would be that growth, at least in the near term, might be a little bit less than we anticipated."
58,"But I do think, in my role as someone who’s extremely interested in financial stability, that addressing the medium- to long-term deficit problem is very urgent."
59,"Well, we expect—as the projections show, we expect growth in the second half of this year and next year to be certainly faster than it’s been so far in 2011."
60,"In terms of the unemployment rate, though, given that growth is not much above the long-run potential rate of growth—and we have in our projections an estimate of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, we haven’t really done much better than that—it takes growth faster than potential to bring down unemployment."
61,"And since we’re not getting that, we project unemployment to come down very painfully slowly."
62,"At some point, if growth picks up as we anticipate, job numbers will start getting better."
63,"We’re still some years away from full employment in the sense of 5½ percent, say, and that’s, of course, very frustrating because it means that many people will be out of work for a very extended time."
64,"Inflation is above—at the moment, is above target."
65,"After all, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, a central bank can always create money, and so on."
66,"I also argued—and I think it’s well understood that deflation, persistent deflation can be a very debilitating factor in—in growth and employment in an economy."
67,"We could infer from, say, TIPS prices—inflation index bond prices—that investors saw something on the order of a one-third chance of outright deflation going forward."
68,I think also that our policies were constructive on the employment side.
69,"But we did take actions as needed, even though we were at the zero lower bound of interest rates, to address deflation."
70,"Each has his or her own view on the outlook, on the efficacy of monetary policy, and on the risks to inflation and unemployment."
71,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago."
72,"There’s also evidently a lot of uncertainty about employment, about the economic recovery, and that’s affecting people’s willingness to make the commitment to buy a house."
73,"Of course, our monetary policy is intended to try to promote employment and income gains, which, of course, will help housing demand."
74,"I think otherwise I’d like to see just further efforts to—first of all, to modify loans where appropriate; to—and where not appropriate, to speed the process of foreclosure and disposition of the foreclosed homes in order to clear the market; get these homes out of the pipeline; and allow people to, you know, to operate in a market where they’re more confident that prices will be stable rather than falling."
75,"It’s interesting now that—although house prices overall are declining, all of that is concentrated in distressed properties; that is, houses which are not being sold on a distressed basis have much more stable prices than those which are being sold on a distressed basis."
