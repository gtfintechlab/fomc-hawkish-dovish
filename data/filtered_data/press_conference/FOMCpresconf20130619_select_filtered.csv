0,"The labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment averaging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months."
1,"However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment."
2,Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent for some time and has been a bit softer recently.
3,"The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors, and with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, the Committee expects inflation to move back towards this 2 percent longer-term objective over time."
4,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
5,"Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards levels of unemployment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
6,"In brief, participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent in 2015."
7,"The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent, declining to 5.8 to 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2015."
8,Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer-run objective; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 percent for this year and 1.6 to 2.0 percent for 2015.
9,"While participants continue to think that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio should consist predominantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or eliminate residual MBS holdings."
10,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies."
11,"As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering the target for the short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate."
12,"First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the senses described in the FOMC statement."
13,"As I have noted frequently, the phrase “at least as long” in the Committee’s interest rate guidance is important."
14,"For example, assuming that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase."
15,"All else equal, the more subdued the outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would likely be in making that assessment."
16,"Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee’s balanced approach to meeting its employment and price stability objectives."
17,The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.
18,"When our program of asset purchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability and noted it would also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program."
19,"Going forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near-term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes."
20,We also see inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time.
21,"In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program."
22,"Indeed, should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability."
23,These large and growing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.
24,"In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the Federal Reserve remains committed to fostering substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
25,"In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis, is now, obviously, a support to growth."
26,"It’s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise, increased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment."
27,"The main drag, or the main headwind, to growth this year is, as you know, is the federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1½ percentage points of growth."
28,"But we’re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections—and again, these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the Committee—we’ll be obviously very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate."
29,"Rates have tightened some, but, you know, other factors have been more positive—increasing house prices, for example."
30,"They expect house prices to continue to rise, and we see that, for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey."
31,"So, yes, our forecast—our projections do factor that in, and if interest rates go up for the right reasons—that is, both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy—that’s a good thing."
32,"So, I’m agreeing with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy."
33,"Well, Ylan, we just spent two days working on monetary policy issues, and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the questions here on policy."
34,"In other words, when we get to that point, we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate, and among the things we would take into account, first of all, is inflation, and inflation obviously is very low and expected to stay low."
35,"And, as you pointed out, we have underemployment, part-time work, people leaving the labor force, reduced participation, long-term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe the 6.5 percent is a little bit—not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point."
36,"People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or early 2015, but they’re saying that increases in rates may not follow but several quarters after that."
37,I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.
38,"And then, essentially, to allow the low interest rate policy which—to carry us through."
39,"The first is, our target is not 7, it’s not 6½, our target is maximum employment, which, according to our projections, most people on the Committee think is somewhere between 5 and 6 percent unemployment, and that’s where we’re trying to get to."
40,"And if the stock theory of the portfolio is correct, which we believe it is, holding all of those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the, you know, rolling-over maturing securities, will still continue to put downward pressure on interest rates."
41,"And so, between our commitments to a low federal funds rate and the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of stimulus—in our view, enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without incurring unnecessary costs or risks."
42,"You, in your statement before the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that inflation readings have been low."
43,But you maintain that inflation expect—longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
44,"There are a number of, as I mentioned in the statement, there are a number of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate."
45,"For example, the effects of the sequester on medical payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now."
46,So these are some things that we expect to reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit.
47,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down."
48,"And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations, be it forecasts by professional forecasters, whether it’s survey measures from firms or households, those are all still pretty much in the same places they were."
49,"And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin, at least gradually, to return towards our 2 percent objective."
50,"And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only—we want to keep inflation near its objective, not only avoiding inflation that’s too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that’s too low."
51,"Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast that this becomes a problem."
52,"So that’s not inconsistent, that’s just saying that people are looking at a variety of factors, including inflation, which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in thinking about when it’ll be appropriate to start increasing rates."
53,"But our assessment—and, of course, we’re in that market quite a bit, so we have a lot of information about it—our assessment is that that market is still working quite well, and that our purchases are not disrupting the normal price discovery and liquidity functions of that market."
54,"But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically, as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint; where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September—and we have made some progress since last September; and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent."
55,"Again though, it’s very important to understand that that’s—if we do that, that would basically say that, you know, that we’ve had a relatively decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment."
56,"We do believe—although, you know, there’s room for debate—we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets, and the prices of those assets have to adjust to balance supply and demand."
57,"And we’ve taken out some of the supply, and so the prices go up, the yields go down."
58,I think low—inflation that’s too low is a problem.
59,It raises real interest rates.
60,"And, as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that meaningful economically—for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the temporary movements in nonmarket prices, things of that sort."
61,"And so we expect inflation to come back up, that’s our forecast."
62,"We would like to get inflation up to our target, and that will be a factor in our thinking about the thresholds."
63,"And, you know, we’ve got a dual mandate, and it’s maximum employment and price stability."
64,"And there’s a reason why we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is, in fact, you know, some room for real interest rates to move."
65,"Well, when we—as I recall, I believe I have this right—when we introduced the second round of LSAPs, properly known as QE2, in, I think, November 2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time, and there was a lot of complaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices, and that that’s a negative for people around the world."
66,"And we argued at the time that the effects of the Federal Reserve’s policy on global commodity prices was probably pretty small, and that it operated—to the extent it did have an effect—it operated through growth—mostly through growth expectations."
67,"That is, a stronger global economy tends to drive up commodity prices."
68,We haven’t really seen much increase in commodity prices.
69,Commodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year.
70,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker."
71,"And that explains, I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much."
72,"So I think that’s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on commodity prices—I’m not saying it’s zero, but I don’t think that it’s nearly as big as some folks have suggested."
73,"In terms of wages, I think that’s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment, at 7.6 percent, is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied."
74,"Maximum employment, we think, is, again, between 5 and 6 percent, although these are very difficult numbers to estimate."
75,"So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupations, is indicative to me of a labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies, I think—together with low inflation—justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative policy."
76,"And, of course, deflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years, which means that expectations are very much—the public’s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very aggressive policies to break those expectations and to get inflation up to the 2 percent target that the Bank of Japan has set."
77,Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations.
78,"For example, we’ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently."
79,"Some of it has to do with risk-on, risk-off behavior, and some of it probably does have to do with monetary policy in advanced economies, which includes, of course, the United States."
80,"I think the right way to think about it is that, as the G-7 and the G-20 both have noted, that what U.S. monetary policy, like that of Japan, is trying to do is trying to help this economy grow."
81,"And a global recovery, a global—strong global growth depends very much on the U.S. growing at a reasonable rate."
