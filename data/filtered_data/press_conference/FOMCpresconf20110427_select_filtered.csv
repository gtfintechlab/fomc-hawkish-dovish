0,"I’ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committee’s quarterly economic projections also being released today, and I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of the Committee’s projections and the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
1,"The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
2,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run."
3,These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.
4,"I call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy."
5,"As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey."
6,"The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in January."
7,"These figures may be interpreted as participants’ current estimates of the economy’s normal, or trend, rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively."
8,"The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of these rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time."
9,"The central tendency of the longer-run projection for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent."
10,"In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the longer-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that Committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices."
11,"At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-consistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons."
12,"Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at zero would increase the risk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and prices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a protracted period."
13,"Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate."
14,"Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at about 2 percent."
15,"For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employment increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement."
16,"Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013."
17,"Specifically, as the table shows, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013."
18,These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-anticipated pace of growth in the first quarter.
19,"The outlook for above-trend growth is associated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent."
20,The projected decline in the unemployment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.
21,"On the inflation front, commodity prices have risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors."
22,Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.
23,"However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased modestly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
24,"Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level."
25,"Specifically, participants’ projections for inflation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the January projections, before declining to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January."
26,"Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy."
27,"The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Committee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer, depending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and price stability."
28,"To foster maximum employment, the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level."
29,"At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow."
30,The substantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relatively slow pace of improvement remain important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy.
31,"In the medium term, the Committee also seeks to achieve a mandate-consistent inflation rate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less."
32,"Although the recent surge in commodity prices has led inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed."
33,"Consequently, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture."
34,"Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages."
35,"Thus, besides monitoring inflation itself, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects."
36,"In providing extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially."
37,The Committee remains confident that it has the tools that it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.
38,Most of the factors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be transitory.
39,"They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, which will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like weather and so on."
40,"At the same time, we’re also looking very carefully at inflation, the other part of our mandate."
41,"As I’ve noted, inflation—headline inflation—is at least temporarily higher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices."
42,Our expectation is that—that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.
43,"But we’ll be watching that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re going to see inflation remain under good control."
44,"The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points: “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations."
45,"First, we are trying to maintain low and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the purchasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low."
46,The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximum employment.
47,"So in our view, if we do what’s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that will also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term."
48,"Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong economy."
49,"So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly."
50,"And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great deal of financial hardship for a lot of people."
51,So it’s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.
52,"Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable."
53,"On the one hand, obviously, the higher gas prices add to inflation."
54,"On the other hand, by draining purchasing power from households, higher gas prices are also bad for the recovery."
55,They cause growth to decline as well.
56,So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.
57,"Now, our—our interpretation of the increase in gas prices is the economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand."
58,"Emerging market economies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong."
59,"Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last couple of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies."
60,"In the United States, our demand for oil—our imports have actually been going down over time."
61,So the demand is coming from a growing economy where we’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emerging market output in the last—since before the crisis.
62,"That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly."
63,"It accounts in the short run for the increase in our—pretty much almost all of the increase in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term."
64,"There’s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is certainly not the right way to go."
65,We don’t control the growth rates of emerging market economies.
66,"What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish."
67,"Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure, but we’ll be watching carefully—our view is that gas prices will not continue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stabilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front."
68,"Last August when we began to talk about another round of securities purchases, growth was very moderate."
69,And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.
70,"And that picked up in the most recent few months, together with the decline in the unemployment rate from, you know, 10 percent down to the current rate of 8.8 percent."
71,"Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are concerned about are medium-term inflation expectations."
72,"So we’ve seen, for example, in the financial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan survey, we’ve seen near-term inflation expectations rise fairly significantly, which is reasonable given higher commodity prices, higher gas prices."
73,"But for the most part, although there’s been some movement here and there, for the most part, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not really moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medium term will be close to what I’ve called the mandate-consistent level."
74,"Ultimately, if—if inflation persists or if inflation expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action."
75,"I think—while it is very, very important for us to try to help the economy create jobs and to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low and stable is absolutely essential to a successful economy."
76,"Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purchases, which—by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserve holds."
77,"Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant going forward from—from June."
78,"That being said, we therefore have to make that decision based on the outlook, based on our view of how sustainable the recovery is and what the condition—the situation is respect to inflation."
79,"Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy."
80,"And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing financial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and for employment."
81,"But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual mandate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate."
82,"And as I was indicating earlier, I think that—even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant."
83,The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.
84,And we saw increases in stock prices.
85,"Now, the conclusion, therefore, that the second round of securities purchases was ineffective could only be validated if one thought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return us to full employment overnight."
86,Inflation has gotten higher.
87,Inflation expectations are a bit higher.
88,It’s not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.
89,"And, in my view, if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to keep inflation under control."
90,Our anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down.
91,"If that happens or if at least oil prices don’t increase significantly further, then inflation will—will come down, and we’ll have—we’ll be close to our medium-term objectives."
92,"So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situation."
93,"I do think that one of the key things that we’ll be looking at will be inflation expectations because, if medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on—at least on an ongoing, sustained basis—these higher costs into broader prices, into creating a broader inflation in the economy, as long as inflation expectations are well—are well stabilized, that won’t happen, then we’ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things evolve."
94,"Again, if we fear that inflation expectations look like they’re becoming less anchored, we would have to respond to that."
95,Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.
96,"And we saw in the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, that a period of high unemployment with very long-term unemployment spells can actually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period."
97,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time."
98,"As the situation drags on and as the long-term unemployed lose skills and lose contact with the labor market or perhaps just become discouraged and stop looking for work, then it becomes really out of the scope of monetary policy."
99,"At that point, job training, education, and other types of interventions would probably be more effective than monetary policy."
100,"That being said, we don’t have any tools for targeting long-term unemployment specifically."
101,We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.
102,"And if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living."
103,"Well, first let me say that, addressing the fiscal deficit, particularly the long-run unsustainable deficit, is a top priority."
104,I would also say that the cuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-term economic activity.
105,"Now, my preference in terms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is to take a long-term perspective."
106,"If the changes are focused entirely on the short run, then they might have some consequences for growth."
107,"And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is, as always, going to try to set monetary policy to meet our mandate, would take those into account appropriately."
108,"I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging markets which have affected commodity prices and other things."
109,"Well, we—we view our monetary policies as being not that different from ordinary monetary policy."
110,"But those tools are operating through financial conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditions—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and so on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation."
111,"And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market."
112,"So we anticipate that we will tighten at the right time and that we will thereby allow the recovery to continue and allow the economy to return to a more normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable."
113,"Our view is that the best thing we can do for the dollar is, first, to keep the purchasing power of the dollar strong by keeping inflation low and by creating a stronger economy through—through policies which support the recovery and, therefore, cause more capital inflows to the United States."
114,"And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high oil prices and other things."
115,"The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, and high foreclosure rates is a terrible combination."
