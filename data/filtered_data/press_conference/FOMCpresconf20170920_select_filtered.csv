0,"This accommodative policy should support some further strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory objectives."
1,"As we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter, economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year."
2,Household spending has been supported by ongoing strength in the job market.
3,"In the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria."
4,"As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under way, growth likely will bounce back."
5,"In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending in August—a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
6,"We know from some timely indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in the affected areas, and payroll employment may be substantially affected in September."
7,"Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
8,We expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further.
9,"Turning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year."
10,Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—has also moved lower.
11,"For quite some time, inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective."
12,"However, we believe this year’s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions."
13,"For example, one-off reductions earlier this year in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services, are currently holding down inflation, but these effects should be transitory."
14,"Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away."
15,"Similarly, the recent hurricane-related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost inflation, but only temporarily."
16,"More broadly, with employment near assessments of its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective."
17,"Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
18,"As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives over the medium term."
19,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessments of the many factors that shape the outlook."
20,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2.4 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
21,"By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer-run rate."
22,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
23,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020."
24,"Compared with the projections made in June, real GDP growth is a touch stronger this year, and inflation—particularly core inflation—is slightly softer this year and next."
25,"Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to maintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective."
26,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
27,"By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains."
28,"Finally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
29,Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.
30,So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.
31,"We’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously."
32,"I’m very pleased and heartened by the improvement we have seen in the labor market, and at 4.4 percent, the unemployment rate has really fallen to quite a low level."
33,"As that’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor market, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, has fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and Great Recession hit."
34,"So we certainly seek a strong labor market, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment, and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term."
35,"Now, I recognize and it’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years, and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations."
36,"For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor market—which, my judgment would be, has largely disappeared—very large reductions in energy prices, and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid-2014."
37,"This year, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative, is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the Committee clearly understands what the causes are of that."
38,"All of the variables—GDP, the unemployment rate, and inflation—are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors, and so there is variation in these economic variables from year to year."
39,"You can see from the projections that the Committee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year—namely, that the shortfall this year is due to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year."
40,But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.
41,"We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor market, in deciding what we should actually do going forward."
42,"And if it proves contrary to our expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that."
43,"But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, which we need to take account of in monetary policy, monetary policy also operates with a lag."
44,"And experience suggests that tightness in the labor market, gradually and with a lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that’s also a risk, that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere down the road, to have to tighten monetary policy rapidly, which could cause a recession and threaten the very desirable labor market conditions that we have now."
45,"So developments affecting asset prices and longer-term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking."
46,But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.
47,"Sometimes movements—upward movements in asset prices can, for example, reflect a change in market participants’—reduction in market participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of interest rates."
48,"So there has been—there have been downward revisions both to the Committee’s and to market participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal level of interest rates, which in turn reflects in some sense a view that, going out many years, aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growth and aging populations."
49,"And, of course, we don’t know if that view is correct, but that’s a factor that could be reflected—could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have."
50,"That’s important in determining the impact on the overall outlook, but, certainly, we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy."
51,So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use: the balance sheet and adjustments in short-term interest rates—our federal funds rate target.
52,"And, historically, the Committee has operated to adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting the federal funds rate—our short-term interest rate target."
53,"We have said if there were that type of material deterioration in the outlook where we could face a situation where the federal funds rate isn’t a sufficient tool for us to adjust monetary policy, we might stop—we might stop roll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment."
54,"So, if there are small changes in the outlook that require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not, for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop—continue reinvestment for a few months and then change it."
55,"We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual."
56,"But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy."
57,"What’s not subject to change is our commitment to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has assigned to us, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment."
58,"So, certainly, if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly, we have room."
59,So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.
60,"After all, we’ve had a number of years in which inflation has been low."
61,"As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you go back to, say, 2013 and consider the—until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand."
62,"It’s a combination of slack in the labor market, declines in energy prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation."
63,So what’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.
64,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation, as we mentioned in the statement—they have declined, and they’ve been stable in recent months, but they’ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards."
65,"That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’t get a clear read—there are risk premia built into inflation compensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are."
66,I can’t say I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this low.
67,"I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but, frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things."
68,The fact that inflation is unusually low this year does not mean that that’s going to continue.
69,"Remember that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12-month basis at around 1.9 percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now."
70,"We’ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they’re likely to prove transitory, and that’s what we’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data."
71,"Of course, if we determined our view changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory, we came to the view that they would be persistent, it would require an alteration in monetary policy to move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment."
72,"Not in the last couple of quarters, but over the last several years, there’s been a growing recognition that the so-called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and research bearing on this topic suggest that it’s quite low."
73,"With a 2 percent inflation rate, that long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or slightly positive rates now."
74,"Chair Yellen, a month ago you delivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, “The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.” I have a two-part question based on that quote."
75,"And then, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the Fed has followed for the last 10 years has helped bring us to full employment, but economists point out that there have been people who haven’t benefited."
76,"Housing prices—the median house price is now at a record high, and 39 million Americans, according to a Harvard study, spend more than 30 percent for housing."
77,But I also tried to emphasize—and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the availability of credit.
78,"We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and our congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability."
79,"So we set monetary policy not with a view toward affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those congressionally mandated goals."
80,"And I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of pertaining to the labor market show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely important to the economic well-being not at the top end of the wealth and income distribution, but to the bottom end of the income distribution."
81,"You know, I’ve put forward a few principles about fiscal policy that I would reiterate, that one of the problems that the American economy suffers from, along with many other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth."
82,"We do face, in terms of longer-term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I believe, some adjustments to fiscal policy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind."
83,A recent Fed working paper estimated that the full set of balance sheet actions that we took during the crisis may have lowered long-term interest rates by about 100 basis points.
84,"Every measure of the labor market, whether it’s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, the number of people working in part-time jobs who want full-time work, the level of job openings, the quit rate, the difficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of confidence we see in surveys about the labor market—all of that is pointing to vast and continuing improvement in the labor market."
85,"And we see sufficient strength in the economy, in terms of spending—that growth, with its ups and downs, but nevertheless is strong enough—looks to be strong enough in the medium term to support ongoing improvement in the labor market."
86,"And all of that is good, and I think that the American people should feel the steps we’re taking to normalize monetary policy are ones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we’ve seen in the economy."
87,"Now, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we’ve talked about that a lot during this—the last hour."
88,"This past year, where it’s not clear what the reasons are—I think it’s not been mysterious in the past, but, one way or another, we have had four or five years in which inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, and we are also committed to achieving that."
89,So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 percent and to maintain a strong labor market on a sustainable basis.
90,"One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that, although we don’t think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that’s going to be persistent."
91,"And if we tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance—leave it at too low a level—inflation expectations could fall, and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous."
92,And so that’s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is.
93,"But, on the other hand, we have a strong labor market and a low unemployment rate."
94,"And although the pace of job gains is not quite as strong this year as, for example, as it was in 2016, we’re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of maybe 100 to 120,000 that would be consistent with a stable unemployment rate if labor force participation begins to move down in the manner we expect."
95,"We think the economy could overheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective."
