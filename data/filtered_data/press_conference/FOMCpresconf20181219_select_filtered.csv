4,"Growth in other economies around the world has moderated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to still-solid levels."
5,"At the same time, financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of months, and overall financial conditions have tightened—that is, they have become less supportive of growth."

7,"The projections of Committee participants released today show growth continuing at Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and inflation remaining near 2 percent."
8,Three years ago the Committee came to the view that the best way to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.
9,Today we raised our target range for the short-term interest rates by another ¼ percentage point.
10,We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year.
11,"Last December, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percent."
12,FOMC participants and many other forecasters were predicting that growth in 2018 would be strong.
13,"This growth was predicted to push the December 19, 2018 unemployment rate down to near historic lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expected to help push inflation up to 2 percent."
14,"Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropriate way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 percent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years."
15,"Thus, in December 2017, the median of the projections of FOMC participants pointed to three ¼ point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at 2 to 2¼ percent, still below most estimates of the longer-run normal rate."

25,"Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount."

27,"So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data."
28,"And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy."

36,"Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that’s how we’re going to look at it."
37,"The only way to achieve inflation symmetrically around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we’ve been close to that but we haven’t gotten there yet, and we have not declared victory on that."

45,"And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes."
46,"That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent."
47,It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent.
48,"As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy."
49,"So—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought."
50,"It has—what’s happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth."
51,"There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us."

57,"There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn’t have high inflation."
