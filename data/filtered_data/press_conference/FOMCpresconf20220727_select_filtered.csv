4,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
5,And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
6,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
7,"Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
8,"Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per July 27, 2022 month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust."
9,"Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."

15,"Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation."

17,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
18,"We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
19,"And we’re continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
20,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
21,"As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
22,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
23,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways.
24,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
25,"We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return July 27, 2022 inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal."
26,This process is likely to involve a period of below- Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions.
27,But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
28,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
29,"We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint."
30,"July 27, 2022 At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL disappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading."
31,So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.
32,"You know, we’ll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity."
33,"And we’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL getting better, getting closer."
34,"Of course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation."
35,"But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward."
36,"So, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target."
37,"And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much uncertainty."
38,"Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected."
39,"Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be."
40,"And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows."
41,"And we’ll be making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent."
42,"Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward."
43,Headline inflation tends to be volatile.
44,"The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations."
45,The public doesn’t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.
46,"So, as I—as I mentioned, we think it’s necessary to have growth slow down."
47,"And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you’re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021."
48,You’re also seeing tighter monetary policy.
49,We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that—so that the supply side can catch up.
50,And we think that they’re probably necessary if we were to have—to get inflation—if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there.
51,"So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down."
52,"And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy."
53,And nothing works in the economy without price stability.
54,We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.
55,"We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low."
56,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability."
57,"And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate."
58,We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.
59,"We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions."
60,"So, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do."
61,"Without restoring price stability, you won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions."
62,"There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost."
63,They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.
64,"As I mentioned, it’s true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand."
65,"Really, the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5½ percent."
66,We would have expected growth to slow.
67,"But if you look at the labor market, you’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month."
68,The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent.
69,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation."
70,"Of course, we’ve, we’ve long used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives."
71,"Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter—consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that."
72,"The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating."
73,The unemployment rate is very low.
74,"Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down."
75,"And we’ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess."
76,"So executive summary [is]: I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much."
77,"Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment."
78,"So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well."
79,"You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down."
80,"We need to be July 27, 2022 confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels."
81,"And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really."
82,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience."
83,"And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let’s put it that way—in growth."
84,"So, overall, you would say that, in all probability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year."
85,"If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor market actually is—has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see—you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn’t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater."
86,"So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing."
87,"It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
88,"So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down."
89,"We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that July 27, 2022 inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent."
90,"And, of course, we’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down."
91,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened."
92,"When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then."
93,"But before then, inflation was coming down month by month."
94,"This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.” And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are."
95,"You know, we’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
96,"As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation—sorry, what a recession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained for more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it."
97,"So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before."
98,"And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and July 27, 2022 the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that."
99,And my Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.
100,"But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly."
101,"And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market."
102,"It’s an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen."
103,"So, and I mentioned that, that—I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn’t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment."
104,They’re suffering from high inflation.
105,And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.
106,"So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that we know that inflation is too high."
107,"We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people."
108,We need growth to slow to below potential growth.
109,"But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work."
110,It’s what can—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren’t being eaten up by high inflation.
111,"If you talk to people—again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—they’re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation."
