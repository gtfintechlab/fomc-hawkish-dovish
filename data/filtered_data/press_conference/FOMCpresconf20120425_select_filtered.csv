0,"Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then I’ll place the Committee’s policy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy."
1,Each of these policy actions is intended to foster accommodative financial conditions that support the economic recovery in a context of price stability.
2,Most Committee participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually.
3,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference Labor market conditions have improved in recent months, with the unemployment rate FINAL having fallen nearly a percentage point since August."
4,"However, at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated."
5,"Looking ahead, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years, reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth."
6,"Specifically, participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent, declining to 6.7 to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014."
7,"For comparison, participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
8,"Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices."
9,"However, as has been the case for other recent swings in oil prices, the Committee expects that effect to be only temporary."
10,"Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show stability in longer-term inflation expectations."
11,"Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will subsequently run at or below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent."
12,"In particular, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and 1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014."
13,The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.
14,"In particular, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is warranted in light of the persistence of the factors restraining the pace of recovery and the ongoing risks to the economic outlook."
15,"Finally, the Committee took no new decisions regarding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet today, but we remain prepared to adjust our securities holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability."
16,"Well, first, the Committee has certainly been bold and aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy."
17,"So we have been very accommodative, and we remain prepared to do more as needed to make sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close to target."
18,"So, in particular, we will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks, whether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its longer-run normal level, and whether inflation is remaining close to target."
19,"Well, I would just say, first, that our projections still have inflation very close to our 2 percent target."
20,"As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying inflation have been a little stronger than expected."
21,"And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation expectations; the amount of slack in the economy; the commodity price behavior, which has been relatively well-controlled in recent months—all of those things suggest that inflation is going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target."
22,"Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a temporary bulge in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the system and, assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflation ought to moderate to about 2 percent later this year."
23,"The lower bound rose—again, this represents 17 distinct views—but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer, core inflation has been a little stronger than was expected."
24,"And I can only say qualitatively that the Committee will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives, and, in particular, whether the recovery is still continuing."
25,And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to help make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer-run normal levels.
26,"The first was that I believe that a determined central bank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is, falling prices."
27,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation."
28,"When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010, or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balance sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target."
29,"So the very critical difference between the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U.S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation, and, clearly, when you’re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation."
30,"In this case, it’s—we are not in deflation, we have an inflation rate that’s close to our objective."
31,"We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four or five years to support the economy without leading to an unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation."
32,"So the basic feature that is described in our statement, which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time, is still obviously in our projections."
33,"And the reason for that expected pickup over time is, first, a very accommodative monetary policy, which continues to provide support for the recovery."
34,"But in addition, some of the headwinds that have been affecting our recovery—such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit tightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over time and will allow the economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer-run full employment level."
35,"So it’s not a ceiling, it’s a symmetric objective, and we attempt to bring inflation close to 2 percent."
36,"And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason—and we don’t have, obviously don’t have perfect control of inflation—we’ll try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to unemployment."
37,"The risk of higher inflation—you say 2½ percent; well, 2½ percent expected change might involve a distribution of outcomes, some of which might be much higher than 2½ percent."
38,"And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well above 2 percent for a protracted period, that the credibility and the well-anchored inflation expectations, which are such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded, in which case we would in fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodative monetary policy to achieve our employment goals."
39,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent."
40,So there is no presumption even in our econometric models that you need inflation well above target in order to make progress on unemployment.
41,"And as we discussed the range of considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I’ve talked about, for example, the so-called Okun’s law puzzle about whether or not unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out."
42,I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is—I thought that was important.
43,"One is to help make the Fed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’t understand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy."
44,"And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know, what our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans."
45,"And, you know, we’ve seen, for example, less volatility in interest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do."
46,"Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability, it’s not to disappoint or not disappoint investors."
47,"There’s some disagreement, I think, about exactly how balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices."
48,"The view that we have generally taken at the Fed, in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases—the flow of new purchases—which is the primary determinant of interest rates."
49,"And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minimal effects on interest rates at that time."
50,And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation.
51,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.
52,"As for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons; they include monetary policy, of course, but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations, and safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasuries."
53,"So, of course, interest rates will rise at some point."
54,"But all that being said, I think, again, that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low."
55,"Actually, we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting because it is an important issue, trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical, and so on."
56,"Much of it is young people, for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely, but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working."
57,"So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for work, which I think would be a good thing."
58,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference I advanced the hypothesis that the increase in employment we’ve seen in the last five, six FINAL months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a one-time catch-up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009."
59,"If unemployment looks like it’s no longer making progress, that’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy options."
60,"We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past—I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability."
61,"Again, that’s not a forecast, I’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment."
62,"And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the expansion, and the unemployment rate is still over 8 percent."
