0,"The Committee’s baseline expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation have not changed much since December: With appropriate monetary policy, we continue to expect moderate economic growth, further labor market improvement, and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective in two to three years."
1,"The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in the first two months of the year, about in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
2,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time has continued to improve.
3,"But there is still room for improvement: Involuntary part-time employment remains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup."
4,The improvement in employment conditions so far this year has occurred as economic growth appears to have picked up from the modest pace seen in the fourth quarter of last year.
5,"Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate, supported by continued job gains and increases in inflation-adjusted incomes."
6,"In contrast, business investment has been weak, in part reflecting further reductions in oil drilling as a result of low oil prices."
7,Net exports also remain soft as a consequence of subdued foreign growth and the earlier appreciation of the dollar.
8,"Looking ahead, the Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
9,Ongoing economic growth and additional strengthening in labor market conditions are important factors underpinning the inflation outlook.
10,"Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—stepped up to 1¼ percent over the 12 months ending in January, as the sharp decline in energy prices around the end of 2014 dropped out of the year-over-year figures."
11,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has also picked up, although it remains to be seen if this firming will be sustained."
12,"In particular, the earlier declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar could well continue to weigh on overall consumer prices."
13,"But once these transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years."
14,The Committee’s inflation outlook rests importantly on its judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
15,"However, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted."
16,"Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months, although some remain near historically low levels."
17,Market-based measures of inflation compensation also remain low.
18,Movements in these indicators reflect many factors and therefore may not provide an accurate reading on changes in the inflation expectations that are most relevant for wage and price setting.
19,"Nonetheless, our statement continues to emphasize that, in considering future policy decisions, we will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
20,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or own—his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depends on each person’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
21,Participants’ projections for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product or GDP are just a touch lower than the projections made in conjunction with the December FOMC meeting.
22,"The median growth projection edges down from 2.2 percent this year to 2 percent in 2018, in line with its estimated longer-run rate."
23,"The median projection for the unemployment rate falls from 4.7 at the end of this year to 4.5 percent at the end of 2018, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
24,"The median path of the unemployment rate is a little lower than in December, in part reflecting a slightly lower median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
25,"Finally, with the transitory factors holding down inflation expected to abate and labor market conditions anticipated to strengthen further, the median inflation projection rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018."
26,"The median inflation projection for this year is a little lower than in December, but thereafter the median projections are unchanged."
27,"In addition, economic growth abroad appears to be running at a somewhat softer pace than previously expected."
28,"One reason for this is that market expectations for the path of policy interest rates have moved down, and the accompanying decline in longer-term interest rates should help cushion any possible adverse effects on domestic economic activity."
29,"Indeed, while stock prices have fallen slightly since the December meeting and spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities have risen, mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs have moved lower."
30,"Of course, the Committee will continue to monitor these developments closely and will adjust the stance of monetary policy as needed to foster our goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
31,"Returning to monetary policy, as I noted earlier, the Committee decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate."
32,"Such caution is appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook."
33,"The low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that weigh on aggregate demand, including developments abroad, a subdued pace of household formation, and meager productivity growth."
34,This view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
35,"As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level."
36,"In other words, most Committee participants now expect that achieving economic outcomes similar to those anticipated in December will likely require a somewhat lower path for policy interest rates than foreseen at that time."
37,"These forecasts represent participants’ individual assessments of what appropriate policy would be given each person’s own current projections of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
38,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads."
39,"But, given that the economy is now close to our maximum employment objective, you know, hopefully inflation is moving up—I mentioned, as you mentioned, recent readings on inflation have moved up."
40,"But, certainly, our projections are for a gradual increase in inflation, and the Committee—at least, most participants continue to expect that if we follow along this course, that some further adjustments in the federal funds rate will be appropriate but gradual."
41,"So I want to make clear that our inflation objective is 2 percent, and we are projecting a move back to 2 percent."
42,"And we are not trying to engineer an overshoot of inflation, not to compensate for past undershoots, so 2 percent is our objective."
43,We did take note in the statement of the fact that inflation has picked up in recent months.
44,I see some of that as having to do with unusually high inflation readings in categories that tend to be quite volatile without very much significance for inflation over time.
45,"So I’m wary and haven’t yet concluded that we have seen any significant uptick that will be lasting in, for example, in core inflation."
46,"But we note—the Committee notes, as it did in December, that we continue to monitor development trends and developments closely, and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high side, and, as I mentioned, on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures have been on the low side."
47,"So, in that sense, there are risks around the inflation forecast in both—in both directions."
48,So there has been a slight downgrading of the assessment of economic growth for this year.
49,"But, nevertheless, growth is expected to run in—somewhat in excess of potential, so that the labor market is expected to continue to tighten, and by the end of the year, even edge below levels that—of the unemployment rate—that are estimated to be longer in the normal run, and inflation is expected to gradually move back to 2 percent over time."
50,"We still have, weighing on inflation, the influence of earlier declines in energy prices and a prolonged effect from the appreciation of the dollar, but we do expect those transitory influences to fade."
51,"And with a continuing—continuing improvement in the labor market, I think we’ll see upward pressure on inflation."
52,"As I indicated in December—the Committee indicated in December, we want inflation to go back to 2 percent."
53,"But we also want to be careful not to see some significant overshoots, so that we would get behind the curve and potentially be faced with a need to tighten in a very rapid fashion later in a way that could undermine the sustainability of the employment gains we have had."
54,But we do see some continued tightening in monetary policy to be appropriate in that event.
55,"So there has been, by many forecasters, a slight downgrading of forecasts of global growth in—over the coming several years."
56,Chinese growth hasn’t proven a great surprise.
57,"Japanese growth in the fourth quarter was negative, and that was something of a surprise."
58,"And with respect to the euro area, recent indicators suggest perhaps slightly weaker growth."
59,"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity."
60,"Our neighbors both to the north and south, Canada and Mexico, are feeling the impacts of lower oil prices on their growth."
61,"So our projection for global growth, for those reasons, is slightly lower—not dramatically lower, but enough lower to make some difference to our forecast."
62,"We have six weeks, but there will be additional data on the labor market and on various factors that pertain to inflation."
63,So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer spending.
64,"I have to say, it’s very difficult when you look at patterns of consumer spending to—there are many factors that influence it, and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted consumer spending, I’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any—in any rigorous way."
65,"The typical—the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year."
66,"And, of course, on the other side, we are—and, you know, it may be that it will take a while, and it’s something that will slowly strengthen over time if oil prices stay low."
67,"With respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up, the Committee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices, whether they were on the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence."
68,"And when I say that, what I mean is that if oil prices move up during the time that it’s moving up, it raises inflation."
69,"And, similarly, oil prices have obviously moved down a great deal over the last year, and we’re not expecting them to move back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level."
70,"They’re obviously volatile, but, as they stabilize, the influence will move out of both headline—of headline inflation."
71,"So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly we would move back to 2 percent, but I wouldn’t think that that would be something alone that would have great policy significance."
72,"First of all, the U.S. economy has been very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks, and we highlighted that right at the beginning of our statement, where we said that “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.” And that—that is important, that the U.S. economy continues to do well."
73,"And, in addition, oil prices have rebounded from their lows, and that eases concerns about the financial condition of some energy firms and the stresses facing some oil-producing economies."
74,"And, at the same time, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power."
75,"So I must say I’m—I do see broad-based improvement in the labor market, and I’m somewhat surprised that we’re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth."
76,"But in the aggregate data, one doesn’t yet see any convincing evidence of a pickup in wage growth."
77,"So I do think, consistent with the 2 percent inflation objective, that there is certainly scope for further increases in wages."
78,"The fact that we have not seen any broad-based pickup is one of the factors that suggests to me that there is continued slack in the labor market, but I would expect wage growth to move up some."
79,Gains in inflation-adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.
80,"As I mentioned, households have benefited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do reflect—do reflect that."
81,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.
82,"In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have effects—spillovers to other countries."
83,"That’s true of our monetary policy, and it’s true of other countries’ monetary policies."
84,"In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
85,So the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.
86,monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad.
87,Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.
88,So I should point out that I think what you’re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.
89,"That, and the slope of the path of rate increases combined with projections of relatively low inflation."
90,So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.
91,"It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in other views about, for example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve our objectives."
92,"But the slow pace of wage growth, the fact that part-time employment for economic reasons and voluntary part-time employment remains high—we have seen an upward move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the labor market."
93,My guess is that those things influenced individuals who wrote down a slightly lower number for the longer-run unemployment rate.
94,"So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in the labor market and inflation, and it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tight, has been a consistent relationship over time, and I believe that relationship still holds."
95,But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be overstated.
96,"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is."
97,"In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage- and price-setting decisions and inflation behavior, and I believe there’s also solid empirical evidence for that."
98,"And it’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement, that we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectations that matter to wage and price setting."
99,"We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer-term inflation—at longer-term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in prices that they see every day."
100,"In particular, when gas prices go down, which is very noticeable to most households, you tend to see a view—you tend to see responses about long-term inflation marked down."
101,Inflation compensation as measured in financial markets also embodies a variety of risk premia and liquidity premia.
102,"And so, it’s also—we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragraph one, but, again, there’s not a straight read on what’s happening to the expectations that influence wage and price setting."
103,The Committee continues to feel that we are on a course where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up.
