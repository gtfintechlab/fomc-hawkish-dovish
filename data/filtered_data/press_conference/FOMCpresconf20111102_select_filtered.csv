0,"Our purchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates."
1,"In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run."
2,"The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy."
3,"The longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
4,"These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run."
5,"Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision."
6,"The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent."
7,"The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices."
8,"In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less."
9,"Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year."
10,"Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months."
11,"The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors."
12,"Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
13,"Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014."
14,"In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters."
15,Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.
16,The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
17,"In short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow."
18,"Most notably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth."
19,I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.
20,The prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.
21,"Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers."
22,"In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan."
23,"However, inflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages."
24,"Furthermore, survey measures and market indicators imply that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
25,"Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less."
26,"Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014."
27,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
28,The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.
29,"With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation."
30,"We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
31,"Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy decisions as clearly as possible, and we continue to explore ways of enhancing the clarity of our public communications."
32,"Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance of monetary policy."
33,"I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures."
34,"Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk."
35,"If you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side."
36,"So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid."
37,"We have a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think about the two sides of that mandate."
38,"However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy."
39,Unemployment is far too high.
40,"With respect to the current economy, as I described earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy."
41,We are trying to do our best to support economic growth and job creation.
42,"For example, as you know, two of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan, who hold those securities primarily as foreign exchange reserves and, in the case of China, in an effort to keep their exchange rate from appreciating too quickly."
43,"We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but it’s still obviously too low to be consistent with a full employment economy."
44,"For example, this year, the combination of the natural disaster in Japan which had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases, the European debt crisis, which was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision."
45,I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.
46,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases."
47,"One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped."
48,"So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation."
49,"If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation."
50,"So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices."
51,"With respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in December 2008 and the first round of asset purchases in the fall of ’08 and in the spring of ’09, were very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009."
52,I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.
53,"And our best estimates are that—absent the support of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher than it is."
54,"Yes, I do think that with—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum employment."
55,"The other set of tools that we have are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate decisions to economic conditions or to time."
56,"Those are—with interest rates close to zero, those are basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use them and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives."
57,"In terms of when we would use these, I think all I can say is that the Committee will have to look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in terms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe that monetary stimulus would be beneficial, you know, then the Committee obviously would try to take corrective action."
58,"But we remain prepared to take action as appropriate to make sure the recovery continues, to make sure that we have stable prices in the U.S. JOSHUA ZUMBRUN."
59,"I will say that that forecast we have is satisfactory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation remains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of the rate of growth of the economy, the rate at which unemployment comes down."
60,"So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory one in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow."
61,"Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly accommodative now—we brought rates close to zero, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset purchases, we have made commitments about rates, we’ve extended the maturity of our portfolio—so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at the last two meetings, so we are being very aggressive in providing monetary accommodation."
62,"And so it will be very important to see, you know, what actually happens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth."
63,"Again, while I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously, a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment, and I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve’s efforts."
64,"We could provide information about where we want inflation to be in the long term, for example."
65,"We can also provide information about the future path of interest rates, which we’ve done to some extent via our “mid-2013” language in the statement."
66,"I mean, we are hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously implemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these stresses, but in the case that things do get worse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the U.S. economy from the effects."
67,"But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be having the intended effect of lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve, as was anticipated."
68,"That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates which are relevant to the economy."
69,"We are quite aware that very low interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have costs for a lot of people."
70,We have complaints from banks that complain that their net interest margins are affected by low interest rates.
71,Pension funds will be affected if low interest rates for a protracted period require them to make larger contributions.
72,"I think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and recovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy conditions accommodative, trying to support the recovery, trying to support job creation."
73,"We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy."
74,"If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment."
75,"Now, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera."
76,"And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment."
77,"But again, I do think that a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy."
78,"Final comment: Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on."
79,"So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it’s still amenable to monetary policy."
80,"We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter."
