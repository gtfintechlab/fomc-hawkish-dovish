6,"After expanding at a robust 5-1/2 percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter."

9,"In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic and near five-decade low of 3.6 percent."
10,"Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
11,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
12,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent."
13,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."

15,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.

22,"Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals, and in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments."
23,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.

25,We are highly attentive to inflation risks.
26,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
27,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
28,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.
29,"So, you're right, 3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it's been in 50 years."
30,"And that will, of course tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit."
31,"And so we think with fiscal policy less supportive with monetary policy, less supportive we think that job creation will slow as well."
32,"So, it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further."
33,"Implications for inflation really the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector."
34,And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.
35,"So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in we'd like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance."
36,"And that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with two percent inflation."
37,"There's a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market, and have, therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level."
38,"So in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down."
39,And I think put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.
40,"And that that would, that would give us a chance to have lower, good to get inflation down, get wages down, and get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially."
41,"therefore the economy is strong, and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy."
42,"And, you know, I think expectations are that we'll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out."
43,We've seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out.
44,"You know, we'd want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort."
45,"As I said, we've got two months now where core inflation is, is a little lower, but we're not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort."
46,"Inflation, in fact, is under control, and starting to come down."
47,"When we talk about the neutral rate, we're really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher, nor slows it down."
48,That's an estimate for an economy that's at full employment and two percent inflation.
49,And we're going to be making a judgment about whether we've done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.
50,"I think if you see, look at short term inflation expectations, they're quite elevated."
51,"And you can look at that and say, well, that's because people expect inflation to come down."
52,"And in fact, inflation expectations come down fairly sharply."
53,"Longer term inflation expectations are, have been reasonably stable, but have moved up to but only two levels where they were in 2014, by some measures."
54,We don't see a wage price spiral.
55,"We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they're doing that, but there have been price shocks."
56,We can't allow a wage price spiral to happen.
57,And we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.
58,Our tools work on demand.
59,"And to the extent we can affect really oil prices, or other commodity prices, or food prices and things like that, so we can't affect those."
60,But there's a job to do on demand.
61,And that you can see that in the labor market where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers.
62,"For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they're likely to both add to headline inflation."
63,"So they're not, they're going to weigh on the process of supply, of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too."
64,"So, you know, I'll just say for now, we're focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there's plenty to be done there."
65,There's a lot of excess demand.
66,"If you can't, you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn't include the commodity price shocks."
67,"I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored."
68,"Okay, so in terms of the vacancy sign unemployment ratio, we don't have a goal in mind."
69,We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.
70,"So first, the first thing to say is that we understand, and some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation and many aren't."
71,And the -- it's our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant high nature doesn't get entrenched in the economy.
72,"And the way we do that is we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, out of imbalance, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down."
73,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices."
74,And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.
75,"We think we have a good chance to do it without significant increase in unemployment or, you know, really sharp slowdown."
76,It's -- we expect growth to be solid this year.
77,"Now, of course, given events around the world, and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity."
78,"Certainly it will not be -- last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic, as I mentioned, growth over five percent."
79,"But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above two percent."
80,"So and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession, without, you know, a severe downturn without materially high, higher unemployment."
81,"So typically in a recession, you would have unemployment."
82,Now you have surplus demand.
83,"So there should be room in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work."
84,"We have essentially interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools."
85,"You know, it's really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability."
86,And we look at it as our job to what given all the factors that are happening to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability.
87,"So if Congress or the administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I'm not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that."
88,"When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice."
89,"I would say, we do see though, we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years."
90,"Without price stability the economy doesn't work for anybody, really."
91,"But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability."
92,So we've been -- basically we've been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.
93,"This is we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in since the Depression."
94,Then we have this outsize response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.
95,"Then we have inflation, then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half."
96,So it's has been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.
97,"And we need to get, we need to somehow find price stability out of this."
98,"And really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy."
99,"So I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us really that that's who we work for, and that it's the -- it's inflation that people are feeling all over the country."
100,"I mean, its monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent."
101,"Well, so as I mentioned, we're -- you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply."
102,"And what you're seeing as a result of that is prices going up, and at unsustainable levels."
103,Levels that are not consistent with two percent inflation.
104,"And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates, and it moves down."
105,"Interest rates, you know, businesses will invest a little bit less, less consumers will spend a little bit less."
106,"But ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us two percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation."
107,"But, you know, the big pain is in not dealing over time, is in not dealing with inflation, and allowing it to become entrenched."
108,"And inflation had actually come, month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row stayed low."
109,"And by the way, then with the with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year."
110,"Anyway, we got an ECI reading, Employment Compensation Index, reading the Friday before the November meeting."
111,"So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were, before the pandemic hit."
112,And companies can't hire and wages are moving up at levels that would not over time be consistent with two percent inflation over time.
113,"Because these wages are to some extent, being eaten up by inflation."
114,"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too."
115,"As we have, we've had several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that's because it's been a time of low inflation."
116,And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support really a sustained period of strong labor market conditions.
