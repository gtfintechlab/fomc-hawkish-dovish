0,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
1,Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.
2,"Together, these measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
3,Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.
4,"The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals."
5,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
6,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections."
7,"Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
8,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated."
9,"Job growth slowed to 245,000 in November, and while the unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remains elevated at 6.7 percent."
10,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023."
11,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
12,"Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently."
13,"For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft."
14,"Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
15,The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
16,"While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation."
17,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
18,"As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal."
19,Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.
20,"As we reiterated in today’s statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and December 16, 2020 longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
21,We expect to maintain an Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
22,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
23,"In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
24,"Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
25,Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
26,"Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
27,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
28,"And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, and that’s, that’s a powerful message."
29,It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases.
30,"And, you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework."
31,"But with the December 16, 2020 expiration of unemployment benefits—some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is, there’s a need for households and businesses to have, have fiscal support."
32,"We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has."
33,"You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring."
34,You see very high demand.
35,"Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not—are not of a level of concern right now."
36,That’s just reflective of a lot of demand.
37,"There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable."
38,"But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at the moment."
39,"So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags."
40,"In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question."
41,"You know, we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days."
42,"There are—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for a while, and they persist today."
43,"It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up."
44,It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis.
45,"And, you know, we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we’re providing both through low rates and very high levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy."
46,And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.
47,"And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework."
48,"And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in the last several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession."
49,"Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic."
50,And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent.
51,"If you look at what—at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of, of when the Fed will lift off, everything has moved."
52,You asked about monetary policy.
53,So you asked about monetary policy.
54,"Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me."
55,"And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has December 16, 2020 dropped by 1.3 million in—of state and local government."
56,"The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high December 16, 2020 interest rates."
57,"But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement."
58,"So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future."
59,"Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been done in the past."
60,We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.
61,"So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level."
62,"But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year."
63,"And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases."
64,"One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up."
65,"So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize."
66,"I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate."
67,So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.
68,There—the connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.
69,"And the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy."
70,"The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there."
71,"But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent."
72,"Right now we’re buying assets because it’s a—you know, it’s a—it’s a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet."
73,"You know, there’s lots of demand for, for U.S. Treasury paper all—from all over the world."
74,"And so we, we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activity."
75,Asset prices is one thing that we look at.
76,"And that’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense."
77,"I would say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view."
78,"You know, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed."
79,"For my way of thinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well."
80,"And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes."
81,"I think, you know, if we—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term."
