0,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
1,"Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate."
2,"Guided by our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a few weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon."
3,"Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus."
4,"The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
5,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of September 16, 2020 Economic Projections."
6,The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.
7,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023."
8,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
9,"For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income."
10,"More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
11,The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
12,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
13,"The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual-mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
14,We view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.
15,And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at our longer-run 2 percent objective.
16,"In turn, well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times."
17,"Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.” We expect “to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes”—including maximum employment—“are achieved.” With regard to interest rates, we now indicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.” These asset purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.” We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will serve the economy well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take."
18,"Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we “would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
19,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
20,"Effectively, we’re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity."
21,"So what we said in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was that the Committee’s policy decisions reflect “its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessment[s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.” So that’s what we said about financial stability."
22,"And today we said that we’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” But you asked specifically about, about financial stability."
23,One thing I would say is that financial—that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense—is not the first line of defense on financial stability.
24,"But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore September 16, 2020 those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks, more broadly, that could impede the attainment of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our goals in, in setting monetary policy."
25,"We try to use our other tools on them, but we, we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy."
26,"And, you know, you don’t—you also don’t see people, by and large, lifting off or raising interest rates above zero."
27,"It says that we expect that the current setting of, of our rates will be—what we expect [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2 percent inflation, that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we’re on track to achieve inflation moderate—inflation moderately above."
28,"Because it—we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time."
29,"The economy will be below September 16, 2020 maximum employment, below full demand."
30,And that will tend to wear—to put downward Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL pressure on inflation.
31,"So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back, generally."
32,Inflation does move up over time.
33,"Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will keep policy where it is now—keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment, labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, until inflation reaches 2 percent, and until it’s on track to go above 2 percent moderately for some time."
34,"So, as you know, maximum employment is not—is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can."
35,"So it’s broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum September 16, 2020 employment."
36,"So that would certainly mean low unemployment, it would mean high labor force Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL participation, it would mean wages—it would be a whole range of things."
37,"In terms of inflation, you know, this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals."
38,We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation; we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent inflation.
39,We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.
40,"And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that’ll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy."
41,"So, so far the economy has proven resilient to the—to the lapsing of the—to the, of the CARES Act unemployment—enhanced unemployment benefits."
42,"But there’s, there’s certainly a risk, though, that, that those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, and they’ll, they’ll now spend them, and that, as the months pass, if, if there’s no follow-up on that, if there isn’t additional support and there isn’t a job for the—some of those people who are, are from September 16, 2020 industries where, where it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll—that will start Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL to show up in economic activity."
43,"And in that—in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy."
44,"We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that, but we can’t—we can’t get at those things through our tools."
45,"And in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups."
46,"So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans when—you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we’re really at maximum employment."
47,"We also, though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example, the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom—we think that that’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth."
48,"And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity."
49,"And that involves, as I mentioned, you know—I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce—wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ll be able to get economic activity September 16, 2020 back up close to where it was."
50,"And even after, if we do lift off, we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time."
51,"And, by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy."
52,"The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment."
53,"The number of claims, the quantity of claims, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and, frankly, the fact that PUA claims are new—the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims—that’s a new system that had to be set up."
54,"So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it’s a long, long way from maximum employment, and it will be some time getting back there."
55,"I’ll give you another example with—you know, we say unemployment’s 8.4 percent."
56,"If you add those back, the level of unemployment’s probably 3 percent higher."
57,"On the other hand, by that metric, the, the September 16, 2020 unemployment rate would have been in the—in the 20s in, in April."
58,"You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment."
59,"No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment."
60,"A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum—in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum."
61,"It showed labor force participation coming up as—up above many estimates of its trend, as people who’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market."
62,"There’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn’t see inflation."
63,"Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework."
64,"But the good news is, we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation."
65,"As I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t mean a particular headline unemployment number."
66,What it means is maximum employment.
67,"So, you know, we look at—look at that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment."
68,"So, so I would just say, the right—in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very, very broad support, unanimous support for that."
69,"Everyone sees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees, in their own way, the need to address those—and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now at flexible average inflation targeting."
70,It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
71,"It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing."
72,It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.
73,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower."
74,"And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower."
75,"So we want inflation to be—we want it to be 2 percent, and we want it to average 2 percent."
76,"So if inflation averages 2 percent, the public will expect that, and that’ll be what’s built into interest rates."
77,So we’re not looking to have high inflation.
78,We just want inflation to average 2 percent.
79,"And that means that, you know, in a downturn, these days, what happens is, inflation, as has happened now—it moves down well below 2 percent."
80,"And that means that we’ve said for, for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves, for some time, moderately above 2 percent."
81,"So it won’t be—these won’t be large overshoots, and they won’t be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent."
82,"And, you know, those are the people we’re serving, and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent inflation, we believe."
