0,"And finally, I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of our economic projections and our assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy."
1,"As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with our statutory mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
2,"To provide support for the recovery in the context of price stability, the Committee will also continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities."
3,This statement should not be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy.
4,"There is today widespread agreement that clear and transparent central bank communications facilitate well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhance accountability to the public."
5,"The statement begins by noting the Committee’s firm commitment to fulfill our statutory mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
6,"Since monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag, our decisions appropriately reflect the Committee’s longer-run goals, our medium-term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals."
7,"With respect to the objective of price stability, it is essential to recognize that the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation."
8,"The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate."
9,"Over time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public’s ability to make accurate longer-term economic and financial decisions, whereas a lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation, which can lead to significant economic problems."
10,Clearly communicating to the public this 2 percent goal for inflation over the longer run should help foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and will enhance the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.
11,Maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy.
12,"A difference with price stability is that the maximum level of employment in a given economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market, including demographic trends, the pace of technological innovation, and a variety of other influences, including a range of economic policies."
13,"Because monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it is not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment."
14,"Although the Committee cannot freely choose a longer-run goal for employment, it can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inform its policy decisions."
15,"The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making its assessments of maximum employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision over time."
16,"For example, in the latest set of projections that have been distributed to you, Committee participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent—roughly unchanged from last January but higher than the corresponding interval several years ago."
17,"As I noted, the level of maximum employment is not immutable; in particular, it could be increased by effective policies, such as education and training that improve workforce skills."
18,"If the Committee’s assessments pointed to an increase in the maximum attainable level of employment, our policy strategy would be modified appropriately to aim at the higher level."
19,"In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its mandate-consistent rate and deviations of employment from our assessments of its maximum level."
20,"For example, under present circumstances, in which the unemployment rate is elevated and the inflation outlook is subdued, the Committee judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives."
21,"And in the longer term, low and stable inflation can help promote healthy growth in output and employment."
22,"In such cases, the Committee follows a balanced approach in promoting these two objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and potentially different time horizons over which inflation and employment are projected to return to levels judged consistent with our mandate."
23,"In other words, the Committee always treats its primary objectives of price stability and maximum employment symmetrically, and the stance of policy at any given time is determined by the size, social cost, and expected evolution of the deviations of each of the Committee’s policy objectives from its desired level."
24,The longer-run projections—shown at the right of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
25,"Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth."
26,"The Committee expects the pace of economic growth to be, over coming quarters—to be moderate over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the housing sector and still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses."
27,"Specifically, participants’ projections for the growth rate of real gross domestic January 25, 2012 FINAL product in 2012 have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent."
28,"Looking further ahead, economic activity is expected to accelerate gradually in conjunction with strengthening consumer and business confidence, improving financial conditions, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
29,"Specifically, participants’ GDP projections for 2013 have a central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent, and their projections for 2014 have a central tendency of 3.3 to 4.0 percent, noticeably higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for their longer-run growth projections."
30,"A number of recent indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
31,"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels."
32,"Indeed, participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.2 to 8.5 percent that is little different from the latest monthly reading of 8.5 percent."
33,"With economic growth expected to pick up somewhat over time, the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 6.7 to 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
34,I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.
35,"The prices of oil and other commodities have generally flattened out or turned downward over the past couple of quarters, while low levels of resource utilization have continued to constrain the growth of labor costs."
36,"Consequently, consumer price inflation—which surged in the first half of last year—has been subdued in recent months."
37,Survey measures and financial market indicators imply that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
38,"Over coming quarters, the Committee anticipates that inflation will run at or below levels consistent with the mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent."
39,"Specifically, participants’ inflation projections have a central tendency of 1.4 to 1.8 percent for 2012 and remain subdued at around 1½ to 2 percent through 2014."
40,"As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee recently decided to begin publishing information about participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy—that is, the path of policy that each participant judges as most likely to foster mandate-consistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected."
41,"These judgments about future policy underlie the participants’ projections of growth, unemployment, and inflation that I just described."
42,"In particular, the Committee recognizes the hardships imposed by high and persistent unemployment and an underperforming economy, and it is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient progress toward our assessments of its maximum level or if inflation shows signs of moving further below its mandate-consistent rate."
43,"We will, as I’ve said in my statement, and as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings—our portfolio holdings, securities, and we are prepared to take further steps in that direction if we see that the recovery’s faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target."
44,"We’ve kept interest rates close to zero, we’ve done two rounds of asset purchases, we have announced—today, in fact—an extension of the period over which we expect to see rates very low, and our maturity extension program is still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point."
45,I would further say that I think it’s important to emphasize that we’re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants provide and just build policy off of that.
46,"Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, there is a case for additional policy action, and we’ll—you know, we want to continue to observe the situation, but we’re certainly prepared to look for different ways to provide support to the economy if, in fact, we have this unsatisfactory situation."
47,"Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years."
48,"Certainly, we are seeing a reversal, or at least a flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise earlier in 2011."
49,"And the futures markets, and our own estimates of supply and demand globally with the slowing global economy, suggest that most likely—although, of course, there’s a lot of uncertainty—that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years."
50,"On top of that, of course, we have a very high rate of unemployment; pressure on wages is quite restrained."
51,"And putting that together with strong productivity gains, the costs of production—unit labor costs—are growing very slowly."
52,"Expectations of inflation seem well anchored and, in fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months."
53,"So for all those reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below the 2 percent target going forward."
54,"With respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a—we have been providing, in fact, for four years, as long as we’ve been providing the economic projections—an estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment, which is currently—the central tendency is currently 5.2 to 6 percent."
55,"We’re concerned that the large amount of long-term unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, at least for a while, will also likely increase the so-called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of unemployment."
56,"But in any case, while there’s certainly a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the natural rate of unemployment is, clearly, at 8½ percent, I think we’re comfortably above anybody’s estimate, and for that reason, we still consider the labor market to be obviously quite slack."
57,"That being said, you know, currently, the zero lower bound on policy rates—at least according to many estimates—is still binding; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate."
58,"So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is quite wide-ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you more confidence that that’s not dependent on a single individual."
59,"We cannot control, of course, where inflation and unemployment are at each moment in time, and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels."
60,"So, for example, if inflation did go above target by a modest amount, we would certainly try to get it back down to target, but if unemployment were very high, that would lead us to be more cautious and slower in returning to target."
61,"I have a job to do, and as long as I’m here, I will do everything I can to help the Federal Reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."
62,"In the case of savers, you know, we think about all these issues, and we certainly recognize that the low interest rates that we’re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return."
63,"So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help restore the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that, in turn, will lead ultimately to higher returns across all assets for savers and investors."
64,"One reason why it’s extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any losses due to inflation that savers might suffer."
65,"In other words, a bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can borrow at, and by having additional capital requirements, that tends to equalize the cost of funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to create the impression of being too big to fail."
66,"You know, one is that it certainly remains—expanding the balance sheet certainly remains an option, one that we would consider very seriously if—in particular, if progress toward full employment was continued, or it became more, inadequate, or if inflation remained exceptionally low."
67,"I can make one additional point, which maybe wasn’t obvious, which is that, in June, we provided some principles relating the sales of assets—ultimate sales of assets—to the path of interest rates, and those remain—those principles remain in force."
68,"The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary policy has not been more powerful—because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates, which affects refinancing; it affects sales and purchases as well."
69,"I mean, that’s true not just in these current times, but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that’s something we have to think about."
70,"So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero."
71,There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices.
72,"But as we’ve talked about frequently, we set inflation—our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate: price stability—and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it’s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the part of households and businesses—but also in the interest of employment."
73,A target for inflation that was zero would have several consequences.
74,"And we’ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance and bad for employment, and, therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not consistent with the other part of our mandate."
75,"Incidentally, related to that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be, and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a situation like today where we really can’t cut the short-term interest rate any further."
76,So I think there are good reasons from a dual-mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent.
77,"And I would add that, you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are nominal inflation targeters or not, that use; the ECB, many other central banks either use 2 percent or a range around 2 percent."
78,"If by “inflation targeter” you mean a central bank that puts top priority on inflation and other goals, like employment, as subsidiary goals, then the answer is no."
79,We are a dual-mandate central bank: We put equal weight on price stability and maximum employment; those are the goals given to us by the Congress.
80,"And so, in that respect, as I mentioned earlier, I think, to Greg, we’re not absolutists: If there’s a need to let inflation return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that’s something that we would be willing to do."
81,"Having said all that, I think it’s worth noting that even banks that—central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some attention to other parts of the economy: employment, growth, financial stability, and the like."
82,"So I don’t think there’s really any central bank, or very few, at least, that focus only on inflation."
83,"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing."
84,"I might have commented on Zach’s question that our two main tools at this point—given that short-term interest rates are close to zero—are asset purchases, but the other is communications."
85,"So, you know, we don’t set the federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting; we have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some kind of consensus."
86,"So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest rates, but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections should give significant information about where the FOMC is likely to go."
87,"One is, it reduces the share of the inflation index which is tied to housing."
88,So I think this is probably a better measure of the inflation that’s faced by typical consumers than the CPI is.
89,"So, in that respect, I think if people look at the CPI, they should feel pretty comfortable that, you know, that’s going to be very close to where the PCE inflation is."
90,"And now, it’s true, as has been pointed out, that for the moment interest rates are pretty low, but they’re still positive."
91,"But over a longer period of time, if you—even if you have money in a CD or some other investment vehicle, the interest rate will compensate you for inflation."
92,"And so there really shouldn’t be, you know—at levels of inflation this low, interest rates should pretty much fully compensate for the losses to savers."
93,"But I would reiterate that we are not unaware of the problems that low interest rates cause for savers, cause for pension fund contributions, insurance companies, and other parts of the economy, and we do try to take that into account as we think about other ramifications of our policy."
