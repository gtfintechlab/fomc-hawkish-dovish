0,"Since the Committee met in July, the pace of job gains has been solid, the unemployment rate has declined, and overall labor market conditions have continued to improve."
1,"Inflation, however, has continued to run below our longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy and import prices."
2,"While we still expect that the downward pressure on inflation from these factors will fade over time, recent global economic and financial developments are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term."
3,The Committee continues to anticipate that the first increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
4,I will note that the importance of the initial increase should not be overstated: The stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the initial increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
5,"Growth in business fixed investment was moderate, held down in part by a significant contraction in oil drilling activity as a result of the large drop in oil prices over the past year."
6,"Moreover, net exports were a substantial drag on GDP growth during the first half of the year, reflecting the earlier appreciation of the dollar and weaker foreign demand."
7,The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of overall GDP growth even though the restraint from net exports is likely to persist for a time.
8,The labor market has shown further progress so far this year toward our objective of maximum employment.
9,"The unemployment rate, at 5.1 percent in August, was down 0.4 percent from the latest reading available at the time of our June meeting, although that decline was accompanied by some reduction in the labor force participation rate over the same period."
10,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time has continued to improve.
11,"That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains: While the unemployment rate is close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal level, the participation rate is still below estimates of its underlying trend, involuntary part-time employment remains elevated, and wage growth remains subdued."
12,"Inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent objective, partly reflecting declines in energy and import prices."
13,My colleagues and I continue to expect that the effects of these factors on inflation will be transitory.
14,"However, the recent additional decline in oil prices and further appreciation of the dollar mean that it will take a bit more time for these effects to fully dissipate."
15,"Accordingly, the Committee anticipates that inflation will remain quite low in the coming months."
16,"As these temporary effects fade and, importantly, as the labor market improves further, we expect inflation to move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective."
17,Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
18,"However, the Committee has taken note of recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation and will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
19,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
20,"Reflecting upward revisions for the first half of the year, participants increased their projections for economic growth this year, compared with the projections made in conjunction with the June FOMC meeting."
21,"The median growth projection is 2.1 percent for this year and rises to 2.3 percent in 2016, somewhat above the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
22,"Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer-run rate."
23,The unemployment rate projections are a bit lower than in June.
24,"At the end of this year, the median unemployment rate projection stands at 5 percent, down 0.3 percent from June and close to the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
25,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further next year and then leveling out.
26,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and non-energy import prices."
27,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor market conditions continue to firm, the median inflation projection rises from just 0.4 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2018."
28,The path of the median inflation projections is a bit lower than in June.
29,"The outlook abroad appears to have become more uncertain of late, and heightened concerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies have led to notable volatility in financial markets."
30,"Developments since our July meeting—including the drop in equity prices, the further appreciation of the dollar, and a widening in risk spreads—have tightened overall financial conditions to some extent."
31,These developments may restrain U.S. economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.
32,"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today’s policy decision."
33,The recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far and domestic spending appears sufficiently robust that an argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time.
34,"However, in light of the heightened uncertainties abroad and a slightly softer expected path for inflation, the Committee judged it appropriate to wait for more evidence, including some further improvement in the labor market, to bolster its confidence that inflation will rise to 2 percent in the medium term."
35,Let me again emphasize that the specific timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is far less important for the economy than the entire expected path of interest rates.
36,The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the rate that most participants expect to prevail in the longer run despite the fact that the median projection has the unemployment rate slightly below its longer-run normal level and inflation close to our 2 percent objective.
37,"I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, as usual, are conditional on participants’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
38,"If the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory."
39,"And, as I mentioned, the inflation outlook has softened slightly."
40,"We’ve had some further developments—namely, lower oil prices and a further appreciation of the dollar—that have put some downward pressure in the near term on inflation."
41,"Now, we fully expect those further effects, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices, to be transitory."
42,"But there is a little bit of downward pressure on inflation, and we would like to see some further developments."
43,"And this, importantly, could include—is likely to include—further improvements in the labor market that would bolster our confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term."
44,"We see domestic demand growing at a solid pace, the labor market continuing to improve."
45,"I can’t give you a recipe for exactly what we’re looking to see, but, as we say, we want to see continued improvement in the labor market, and we would like to bolster our confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent."
46,"As I said, although we are close to many participant’s [estimates] and the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment—and this has been true for a long time—is that there are additional margins of slack, particularly relating to very high levels of part-time involuntary employment and labor force participation, that suggest that, at least to some extent, the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market."
47,"And, as I’ve said in the past, we don’t want to wait until we’ve fully met both of our objectives to begin the process of tightening policy given the lags in the operation of monetary policy."
48,"So, your first question was, have we come closer or moved further away from our inflation goal."
49,"We’re, after all, way below our inflation target."
50,But an important reason for that is that declines in import prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and declines in energy prices are holding down inflation well below our target and well below core inflation.
51,"We expect those effects to be transitory, and with well-anchored inflation expectations, we expect inflation to move back to 2 percent."
52,"Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar and some further downward pressure on energy prices, and that creates a bit of further drag on inflation that I would view as transitory—is very likely to be transitory."
53,"So I continue and the Committee continues to expect that inflation will move back to 2 percent, so this should be a small thing."
54,"And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor market, a labor market moving toward full employment, is one that historically has generated upward pressure on inflation."
55,So that bolsters my confidence in inflation.
56,"On the other hand, we’ve had a long period in which inflation has been running below our objective."
57,"I consider it, and the Committee does, very important that we—we achieve our inflation objective and defend against inflation that is persistently above our inflation objective and also persistently below our inflation objective."
58,"We did take note in the statement of a decline in inflation compensation, and it’s hard to get a direct read on inflation expectations out of these measures."
59,"Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can to revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective."
60,"And after we took the funds rate down to zero, as you know, we put in place a number of other extraordinary measures—including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases—in order to speed the recovery and attain both our inflation objective and our maximum employment objective."
61,"And, I mean, when you look at the projection, you see, as you mentioned, that we see sufficient growth to push the unemployment rate."
62,"We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly—or, at least, participants project that it will fall slightly below that level."
63,"As that occurs, we would expect labor force participation, the cyclical component of that, to diminish over time, and we would hope to see some decline in the portion of slack that’s reflected in high levels of part-time involuntary employment."
64,"Now, inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent."
65,"We have very large drags from import prices and energy prices, and over the next year or so, those things should dissipate."
66,"And the behavior of inflation should mainly—if we—if our understanding of the inflationary process is correct and if inflation expectations are well anchored at 2, which I believe they are, as the labor market heals and as that healing progresses, we will see further upward pressure on inflation."
67,"Now, it’s a slow process, it’s characterized by lags, and that’s why it takes a few years as the inflation—as the unemployment rate falls and even overshoots its longer-run normal level, it just takes some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent."
68,"And it’s certainly important for us, and I think our credibility hinges on defending our inflation target not only from threats that it rises above, but also that we not have—that over the medium term, that we want to see inflation get back to 2 percent."
69,We want to see inflation go back to 2 percent; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation.
70,So we’re not trying to push the inflation rate above 2.
71,"And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that, on average, would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent."
72,We want to see the inflation rate get back to 2 percent as rapidly as we can.
73,But there are lags in the impact of monetary policy on the economy.
74,"And if we waited until inflation is back to 2—and that would probably mean that unemployment had declined well below our estimates of the natural rate—and only then did we start to—begin to—and, you know, the word “tighten” monetary policy I don’t think is really right because we have an immensely accommodative monetary policy in place."
75,"So, let me say, just to begin to diminish the extraordinary degree of accommodation for monetary policy, we would be overshoot—we would likely overshoot substantially our 2 percent objective, and we might be faced with then having to tighten policy in a way that could be disruptive to the real economy."
76,"But, at the end of the day, what we’re focused on are two things: the path for employment and whether or not we feel confident that we’re on a road that will take us to our maximum employment objective and whether or not we see the risks around obtaining that as balanced."
77,"Of course, there will be uncertainty around it and whether or not we have reasonable confidence that inflation, will, over the medium term, go back to 2 percent."
78,"Now, we’ve long expected, as most analysts have, to see some slowing in Chinese growth over time as they rebalance their economy."
79,"In addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity markets, and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market economies that are important producers of commodities as well as more advanced countries, including Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected by declining commodity prices, declining energy prices."
80,"And we’ve seen significant outflows of capital from those countries, pressures on their exchange rates, and concerns about their performance going forward."
81,"We are looking at, as I emphasized, a U.S. economy that has been performing well and impressing us by the pace at which it’s creating jobs and the strength of domestic demand."
82,"I think, importantly, we say in our statement that in spite of all of this, we continue to view the risks to economic activity and labor markets as balanced."
83,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections."
84,"And the lags will be probably slow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation objective, and then we’ll be forced into a kind of stop–go policy."
85,"And instead of having slow, steady growth, improvement in the labor market, and continued improvement and good performance in the labor market, I don’t think it’s good policy to have to then slam on the brakes and risk a downturn in the economy."
86,"So, let me be clear that negative interest rates was not something that we considered very seriously at all today."
87,"But one participant in the Committee would like to see additional accommodation, is concerned by the inflation outlook, and thinks that we need additional stimulus, additional accommodation to provide that, and proposed doing so by moving interest rates negative."
88,"So, monetary policy—U.S."
89,monetary policy is directed toward trying to achieve the goals the Congress has laid out for us.
90,"When we—when monetary policy tightens and interest rates rise, it commonly is the case, either when it happens or in expectation—the expectation that that’s coming—interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates.1 So monetary policy often has some effect on the exchange rate, and it’s not, in my view, the main channel by which monetary policy works."
91,"It’s one of a number of different channels by which monetary policy works, but it does have some impact on exchange rates, and, of course, yes, we need to take that into account."
92,1 Chair Yellen intended to say that “interest rate differentials globally do tend to induce capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates.” GREG ROBB.
93,"It remains very depressed—housing starts below levels that seem consistent with underlying demographics, especially in an economy that’s creating jobs, and we have lots of people who are still doubled up, and demand for housing should be there and should materialize as the job market improves and income growth improves."
94,"And, remember, we’re envisioning, if things go as we anticipate, a pretty gradual path of increases in short-term interest rates over time."
95,"It is true that interest rates affect asset prices, but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and assets."
96,"To me, the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work."
97,"And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by a high—having high unemployment and a weak job market that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulnerable individuals, to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market that has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population, that’s not something that increases income inequality."
98,"There have been a number of studies that have done—been done recently that have tried to take account of many different ways in which monetary policy, acting through different parts of the transmission mechanism, affect inequality."
