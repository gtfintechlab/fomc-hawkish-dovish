0,"The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal."
1,"As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to 1¾ percent.1 This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now."
2,"The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher."
3,"That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong."
4,"Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderated early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid."
5,"Several factors are supporting the outlook: Fiscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
6,"Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
7,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in January."
8,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period."
9,"However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago."
10,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term."
11,"Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation."
12,Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.
13,"Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median projection for the growth of inflation-adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate."
14,"The median projection for unemployment—for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
15,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020."
16,"Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher."
17,"As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion March 21, 2018 continues."
18,"In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
19,"By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion."
20,"At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future."
21,"Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and price stability objectives."
22,"If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately."
23,"As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
24,"As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions March 21, 2018 were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the federal funds rate."
25,"The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation."
26,"And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent."
27,You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.
28,And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.
29,"So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will."
30,"The—on the other side, if we—if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward."
31,"We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent."
32,"You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below."
33,"And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation."
34,"It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent March 21, 2018 inflation."
35,"You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from—unemployment from its goal."
36,"You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth."
37,"It March 21, 2018 would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to Chairman Powell’s Press Conference FINAL get there."
38,So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.
39,"So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point."
40,"As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation."
41,"So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that."
42,"As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation."
43,"We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that."
44,"I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained March 21, 2018 period, you would see an acceleration of inflation."
45,"Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow-moving forces over time."
46,"We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates."
47,"We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy."
48,"In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis."
49,"And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity."
50,I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.
51,So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.
52,"You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth."
53,"So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate."
54,"I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation."
55,Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.
56,"For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves."
57,"So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those."
58,We can’t pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.
59,So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.
60,"You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices."
61,"So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms."
62,You can think of some equity prices.
63,You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets.
64,"If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years."
65,"I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time."
66,"It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity."
67,"They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be."
68,"As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages."
69,"So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases."
70,You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.
71,And productivity’s been very low.
72,Inflation’s been low.
73,"On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more."
74,"You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus."
75,"I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession."
