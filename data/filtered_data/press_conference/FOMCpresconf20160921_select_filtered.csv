0,Our current policy should help move the economy toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.
1,"Economic growth, which was subdued during the first half of the year, appears to have picked up."
2,Household spending continues to be the key source of that growth.
3,"The energy industry has been hard hit by the drop in oil prices since mid-2014, and investment in that sector continued to contract through the first half of the year."
4,"Turning to employment, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month over the past four months, about the same solid pace recorded since the beginning of the year."
5,"In the longer run, that’s well above the pace that we estimate is needed to provide work for new entrants in the job market."
6,The unemployment rate in August—4.9 percent—was the same as in January.
7,And a broader measure of unemployment has also flattened out—a measure that includes people who want and are available to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time but would rather work full time.
8,"The fact that unemployment measures have been holding steady while the number of jobs has grown solidly shows that more people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs."
9,Ongoing economic growth and an improving job market are key factors supporting our inflation outlook.
10,"Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was less than 1 percent over the 12 months ending in July, still short of our 2 percent objective."
11,Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy and import prices.
12,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more volatile than other prices, has been running about 1½ percent."
13,"As transitory influences holding down inflation fade and as the job market strengthens further, we continue to expect inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years."
14,Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
15,"However, we can’t take the stability of longer-run inflation expectations for granted, and we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
16,"Indeed, we are fully committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective."
17,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own view of appropriate monetary policy, which in turn depends on each participant’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
18,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, is 1.8 percent this year."
19,This figure is somewhat lower than projected in June as a result of the weaker-than-expected growth seen in the first half of the year.
20,"In 2017 and 2018, the median growth projection is unchanged at 2 percent, somewhat higher than the median estimate of longer-run normal growth."
21,"In 2019, growth edges down to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer-run rate, which has als—which has been revised down a bit since June."
22,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent at the end of this year, a touch higher than in June."
23,"Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs near 4½ percent, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
24,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.3 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
25,"Returning to monetary policy, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the federal funds rate."
26,"And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time."
27,"But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives."
28,"This cautious approach to paring back monetary policy support is all the more appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that we can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future by raising rates than to a weakening labor market and falling inflation by cutting rates."
29,"That’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currently quite low by historical standards."
30,"With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives."
31,"But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years."
32,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
33,"These forecasts represent participants’ individual assessments of appropriate policy, given their projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors at a particular point in time."
34,Growth was weak in the first half of the year; we’re seeing definite evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.
35,The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium value.
36,"I don’t see that as bad news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the labor force back into employment."
37,The employment-to-population ratio has also continued to increase.
38,"And that is some news that we’ve received in recent months, that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in without the unemployment rate coming down."
39,"Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up over time."
40,"At the same time, we generally agree that the stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative."
41,"So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than is sustainable in the longer run."
42,"Now, we have seen people come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn’t fallen."
43,We don’t want the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective.
44,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run."
45,"We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal, and that we want to make sure we stay on a course that raises that to 2 percent."
46,"Well, I think Congress very wisely established the Federal Reserve as an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short-term political pressures."
47,And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
48,We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as affecting the outlook.
49,"Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecasts, revising down our estimates, well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know, if you saw this, you would see revisions in the funds rate path."
50,"But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated, if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had increased."
51,"I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that, while the economy has made a lot of progress, it’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of time."
52,"So, in most advanced nations now, we have highly accommodative policies, and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and employment objectives."
53,And that’s characteristic of a—an environment in which the neutral rate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.
54,"In general, I would not say that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but there are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on: commercial real estate, where price-to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low."
55,We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks.
56,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices."
57,"Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spending extends beyond—beyond that sector, and I’m not certain of exactly what explains that, whether—I’m not aware of evidence that suggests that it’s political uncertainty, but it certainly—I would agree with the finding that it has been weak."
58,You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.
59,I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.
60,"Nevertheless, at this point our balance sheet is large, and we’re not at what we see as the normal level—longer-run level of interest rates."
61,"And it would seem to me, without getting into specifics, that there are ways in which the response of fiscal policy to shifts in the economy could be strengthened, which would help take some burden off monetary policy."
62,"One is the risk that the economy runs too hot, that unemploy—the labor market tightens too much, that unemployment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that, because that is a very difficult thing to accomplish, to gently create a bit more slack in the labor market, we could cause a recession in the process."
63,"On the other hand, inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, and it’s also important that we make sure we get back to 2 percent."
64,"And I have routinely indicated a number of measures of inflation expectations that are running at the low ends of their historical range, and we’re watching that as well."
65,And there would also be risks from not seeing inflation move back to our 2 percent objective.
66,"And that’s my commitment to the American people, that I want to lead an institution that is not political and is—that we are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has assigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment."
67,We called this out in our Monetary Policy Report and in other presentations.
68,"So the projections—I agree, the projections for growth are slow."
69,We have further written down our estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.
70,"And what that reflects is an assessment that productivity growth is likely to remain low for an extended time, although it does embody an expectation that it will pick up from the miserable ½ percent pace per year that we have seen over the last five years."
71,"Now, why we would never—and slow growth is a factor."
72,"Slow productivity growth is a factor that influences the longer-run normal level of interest rates, and writing down the likely pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate."
73,"But now, let’s go to your—the part of your question about inflation."
74,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month."
75,"And that is a very solid pace of job growth and a pace that likely is not sustainable in the longer run, although we’ve been pleased to see people come back in the labor market."
76,"But I think what ultimately drives inflation, both wage and price growth, is that tightness in the labor market and pressure on resource utilization."
77,And the sad fact is that we are getting that healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output.
78,So this is—I don’t think it bears on the inflation outlook.
79,"It has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards."
80,"So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags—that statement is due to Milton Friedman, and it is one of the essential things to understand about monetary policy, and it has not fundamentally changed at all."
81,"Many of the—those of us sitting around the table, we learned the lesson that if policy is not forward looking, that inflation can pick up to highly undesirable levels, that inflation expectations can be dislodged upward, and the consequence of that can be that, endemically, higher inflation takes place, which—it is very costly to reduce."
82,"The nature of the inflation process has changed, I think, significantly since the bad days of the ’70s when the Fed had to face this chronic high-inflation problem."
83,"We’ve seen inflation respond less to the economy, to movements in the unemployment rate—that’s sometimes said, “The Phillips curve has become flatter.” So we’ve seen less of a response."
84,"Inflation expectations appear to be better anchored, and perhaps that’s been a result of a long period of low and stable inflation."
85,"And, in addition, we have to be attentive to the fact there we’ve now had a long period in which inflation is actually undershooting our 2 percent objective."
86,And we see some signs that I—we conclude inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored at 2 percent.
87,"But there always a remi—should be a reminder to us that we also would not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low—running below our objective, inflation expectations are slipping."
88,So I think we have seen some modest pickup in wage growth.
89,And we have seen income growth pick up recently.
90,"But I do expect—we expect the unemployment rate to decline further, we expect labor market conditions to continue to improve."
91,"And my hope and expectation is that we will see some further pickup in wage growth, and that it will be broadly beneficial to American households."
