0,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
1,Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.
2,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
3,"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
4,Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
5,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
6,"Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the July 28, 2021 leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
7,"The unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
8,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
9,"These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment."
10,Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
11,"As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term."
12,"These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal."
13,"Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding."
14,"As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that July 28, 2021 inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
15,"Our new framework for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
16,Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
17,"If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy."
18,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
19,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
20,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
21,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions July 28, 2021 have reached level—levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
22,"In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
23,These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.
24,So let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that.
25,"As you know, with maximum employment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target."
26,"There’s unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such."
27,And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment.
28,"I think we’re, we’re some way away from, from having had substantial further progress with, with max—toward the maximum-employment goal."
29,"So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective."
30,"But it’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent."
31,"That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time."
32,We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.
33,"And so they’re seeing significant outbreaks, and it’s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular—are having a very strong rebound."
34,"And, and, you know, that’ll help economic activity."
35,"To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports."
36,"Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity."
37,"So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected."
38,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.
39,And so we think that inflation should move down over time.
40,"I would say, in the near term, that July 28, 2021 the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside."
41,"I, I, I have some confidence in the—in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the medium term, that inflation will move back down."
42,"I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate."
43,Price stability is half of our mandate.
44,"And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
45,"So we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation."
46,"In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
47,"Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth."
48,"There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed."
49,We are committed to achieving Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent average inflation over time.
50,"What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation."
51,"So we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment."
52,"But we have high inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case."
53,"Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise."
54,"And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues."
55,"So there’s a—there’s a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I’m sure—I’m sure you’re familiar with, which, which talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension."
56,"Most of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have high employment—they, they tend to go together."
57,"We’re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation."
58,"We feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the next—over the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment."
59,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum."
60,"And, again, it’s not—it’s not timely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now."
61,"And there’s also been very generous July 28, 2021 unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off."
62,"You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact."
63,"And if people don’t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things."
64,"It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year."
65,That’s inflation.
66,"When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an example; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have an inflation process."
67,"And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward."
68,"So what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process."
69,"Again, we don’t mean—I don’t mean that, that, that, that, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back."
70,"So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going."
71,"And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up."
72,"But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is—you know, we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability."
73,"Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time."
74,"And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand."
75,"So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation."
76,"And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we’re seeing upward, upward pressure on prices."
77,"What we’re seeing is a handful of things that are really—that really account for the, the overshoot of inflation."
78,"You know, new, used, and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage."
79,"And housing—sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before."
80,"So that’s, that’s a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high."
81,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy."
82,"So what I said was, we, we’re going to see whether these things—we don’t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done."
83,"So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down."
84,"If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they’re not contributing to inflation."
85,"There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big."
86,"So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy."
87,"So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness."
88,"Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time."
89,"We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent."
90,"That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming July 28, 2021 economy maybe."
91,"That, that was the kind of inflation—this, this is something different."
92,"This is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL really driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand that we’re seeing."
93,"As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it just can’t keep up."
94,"Now, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might require a response."
95,"My base case is that—is, as I’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down."
96,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing."
97,But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.
98,"And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now."
99,"And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices."
100,The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.
101,It was called the “wage–price spiral.” We don’t see that now.
102,"This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now."
103,"You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing."
