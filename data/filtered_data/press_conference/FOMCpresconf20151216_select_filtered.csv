0,"Room for further improvement in the labor market remains, and inflation continues to run below our longer-run objective."
1,"But with the economy performing well and expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate target is now appropriate, recognizing that even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative."
2,"As I will explain, the process of normalizing interest rates is likely to proceed gradually, although future policy actions will obviously depend on how the economy evolves relative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
3,"Since March, the Committee has stated that it would raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
4,The labor market has clearly shown significant further improvement toward our objective of maximum employment.
5,"The unemployment rate, at 5 percent in November, is down 0.6 percentage point from the end of last year and is close to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
6,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time also has shown solid improvement.
7,"That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains: The labor force participation rate is still below estimates of its demographic trend, involuntary part-time employment remains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup."
8,The improvement in employment conditions this year has occurred amid continued expansion in economic activity.
9,"Net exports have been restrained by subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar, but this weakness has been offset by solid expansion of domestic spending."
10,"And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in investment outlays, business investment has posted solid gains."
11,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
12,"December 16, 2015 economic growth, these risks appear to have lessened since last summer."
13,"Overall, the Committee Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced."
14,The anticipation of ongoing economic growth and additional improvement in labor market conditions is an important factor underpinning the Committee’s confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
15,Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was only ¼ percent over the 12 months ending in October.
16,"However, much of the shortfall from our 2 percent objective reflected the sharp declines in energy prices since the middle of last year, and the effects of these declines should dissipate over time."
17,The appreciation of the dollar has also weighed on inflation by holding down import prices.
18,"As these transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
19,The Committee’s confidence in the inflation outlook rests importantly on its judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.
20,"In this regard, although some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations have edged down, overall they have been reasonably stable."
21,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near historically low levels, although the declines in these measures over the past year and a half may reflect changes in risk and liquidity premiums rather than an outright decline in inflation expectations."
22,"Our statement emphasizes that, in considering future policy decisions, we will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
23,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
24,"Participants’ projections for real GDP growth are little changed from the projections made in conjunction with the September December 16, 2015 FOMC meeting."
25,"The median projection for real GDP growth is 2.1 percent for this year and Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rises to 2.4 percent in 2016, somewhat above the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
26,"Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer-run rate."
27,"The median projection for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year stands at 5 percent, close to the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
28,Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining a little further next year and then leveling out.
29,"The path of the median unemployment rate is slightly lower than in September, and while the median longer-run normal unemployment rate has not changed, some participants edged down their estimates."
30,"Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower prices for energy and non-energy imports."
31,"As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor market conditions continue to strengthen, the median inflation projection rises from just 0.4 percent this year to 1.6 percent next year and reaches 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018."
32,The path of the median inflation projections is little changed from September.
33,"As I have already noted, much of the recent softness in inflation is due to transitory factors that we expect to abate over time, and diminishing slack in labor and product markets should put upward pressure on inflation as well."
34,"In addition, we recognize that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes."
35,"Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting our objective."
36,"As I have often noted, the importance of our initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate should not be overstated: Even after today’s increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
37,One indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been only moderate in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities.
38,The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on aggregate demand.
39,"Following the financial crisis, these headwinds included tighter underwriting standards and limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy, weak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook."
40,This view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
41,"As the factors restraining economic growth continue to fade over time, the median rate rises to 3¼ percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level."
42,"I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, as usual, are conditional on participants’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment and inflation, and other factors."
43,"Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well."
44,"Specifically, the Board of Governors raised the interest rate paid on required and excess reserves to ½ percent, and the FOMC authorized overnight reverse repurchase operations at an offering rate of ¼ percent."
45,"We decided to move at this time because we feel the conditions that we set out for a move—namely, further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term—we felt that these conditions had been satisfied."
46,"And while there is a drag from net exports, from relatively weak growth abroad, and the appreciation of the dollar, overall, we decided today that the risks to the outlook for the labor market and the economy are balanced."
47,And we recognize that monetary policy operates with lags.
48,"It’s been a long time since the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, and I think it’s prudent to be able to watch what the impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion enables us to do this."
49,It—monetary policy remains accommodative.
50,We have indicated that we will be watching what happens very carefully in the economy in terms of our actual and forecast—our projected conditions relative to our employment and inflation goals and will adjust policy over time as seems appropriate to achieve those goals.
51,"The Committee forecasts that the unemployment rate will continue to decline, and I think that’s important and appropriate for two reasons."
52,"First of all, as I’ve indicated, I continue to judge that there remains slack in the economy, margins of slack that are not reflected in the standard unemployment rate, and, in particular, I’ve pointed to the depressed level of labor force participation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of part-time employment."
53,So a further decline in the unemployment rate and strengthening of labor market conditions will help to erode those margins of slack.
54,"But also we want to see inflation move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and so seeing above-trend growth and continuing tightness—greater tightness in labor and product markets—I think that will help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation."
55,"We have considered the risks to the outlook and worried about the fact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to respond to negative shocks than to positive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy."
56,"But we recognize that policy is accommodative, and if we do not begin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy would end up overshooting both our employment and inflation objectives."
57,"So to keep the economy moving along the growth path it’s on with improving and solid conditions in labor markets, we would like to avoid a situation where we have left so much accommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these objectives and then have to tighten abruptly and risk damaging—damaging that performance."
58,"Well, we recognize that inflation is well below our 2 percent goal."
59,"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective."
60,The Committee is equally committed—this is a symmetric goal—and the Committee is equally committed to not allowing inflation to persist below our 2 percent objective.
61,"Now, I’ve tried to explain—and many of my colleagues have as well—why we have reasonable confidence that inflation will move up over time, and the Committee declared it had reasonable confidence."
62,"Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and we really need to monitor over time actual inflation performance to make sure that it is conforming, it is evolving, in the manner that we expect."
63,"So it doesn’t mean that we need to see inflation reach 2 percent before moving again, but we have expectations for how inflation will behave."
64,"And we have indicated that we’re reasonably close—not quite there, but reasonably close—to achieving our maximum employment objective, but we have a significant shortfall on inflation."
65,I’m not going to give you a simple formula for what we need to see on the inflation front in order to raise rates again.
66,We’ll also be looking at the path of employment as well as the path for inflation.
67,"But if incoming data were—led us to call into December 16, 2015 question the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL of evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause."
68,"We—you know, the Committee expects inflation—over the next year, the median expectation is for inflation to be running about 1.6 percent, and—both core and headline."
69,"First, let me say with respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by the further downward movement in oil prices, but we do not need to see oil prices rebound to higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out."
70,I believe there is some limit below which oil prices are unlikely to rise.
71,"For a number of years between 2004 and 2008, we had a series of increases in oil prices that for a series of years raised inflation above—again, we didn’t have a 2 percent objective then, but—raised it above 2 percent, and we judged those increases to be transitory as well and looked through them."
72,We do monitor inflation expectations very carefully.
73,"If we saw in a meaningful way that inflation expectations were either moving up in a way that made it—them seem unanchored or down, that would be of concern."
74,"We are watching that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored."
75,"So, yes, we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that we thought would disappear over the medium term just as we did overshoots of inflation that we also judged to be transitory."
76,"But we do need to monitor inflation very carefully because if energy prices and the dollar were to stabilize, import prices, our expectation is that both headline and core inflation would move up."
77,"Well, you know, if the economy were disappointing, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflation, we would also take employment into account."
78,"Well, there are number of different channels through which monetary policy is transmitted to spending decisions."
79,"The behavior of longer-term—longer-term interest rates, short-term interest rates matter."
80,"The value of asset prices and the exchange rate, also—these are transmission channels."
81,"Expectations about Fed policy have been built into the structure of financial market prices, but we obviously will track carefully the behavior of both short- and longer-term interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices, and if they move in persistent and significant ways that are out of line with the expectations that we have, then of course we will take those into account."
82,"As you know, communications policy to affect market expectations about the path of interest rates played an important role."
83,"Obviously, we lowered our overnight interest rate effectively to zero."
84,The—we would reduce the size of the balance sheet to essentially whatever size we needed to manage monetary policy effective—in an effective and efficient way.
85,"Well, risk spreads in the high-yield bond market have been widening since last year, partly reflecting falling oil prices—only partly, but partly—and redemptions in high-yield bond funds have been increasing in recent months."
86,So we continue to believe that financial conditions are supportive of economic growth.
87,"So, when you say that central banks often kill them, I think the usual reason that that has been true when that has been true is that central banks have begun too late to tighten policy, and they’ve allowed inflation to get out of control."
88,"And at that point, they have had to tighten policy very abruptly and very substantially, and it’s caused a downturn, and the downturn has served to lower inflation."
89,"So, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their financial prospects going forward, I hope they will take this decision as one that signals the FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen and job market prospects will be good."
90,Longer-term interest rates—loans that are linked to longer-term interest rates are unlikely to move—to move very much.
91,"Some—for example, some corporate loans are linked to the prime rate, which is likely to move up with the fed funds rate, and those interest rates will adjust."
92,Interest rate risk at banks is something that we have been monitoring very carefully for quite a long time.
93,The community banks and smaller banking organizations that we work with—part of our supervision has been ensuring that they manage appropriately for interest rate risk.
94,And the larger banking organizations that are subject to the stress tests and capital planning—the scenarios that we have presented in each of the last three years look at their ability to withstand what would be much sharper increases in interest rates than we’re envisioning would happen.
95,"We have had some further declines in energy prices, and, you know, as I said previously, I do expect there is a bottom to that."
96,"If we—if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that."
97,"But if we concluded that there were structural factors or that there were a problem with our theory or some global deflationary force that were simply persistently holding down inflation in a way that was not transitory—and I don’t want to attach any simplistic meaning to what we would need to see to conclude that in the inflation data, but if we concluded that, we certainly would take action to make sure we adjusted policy so that we attain our 2 percent objective."
98,"Well, starting with the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics that bear on the inflation outlook, and the median CPI has been somewhat more stable and running closer to 2 percent than the PCE, but there is a systematic gap between these two measures, and our objective is 2 percent on the PCE price index, and so there’s no simple translation."
99,We do have a PCE inflation objective.
100,"The global economy—we tend to focus—there are many countries that are undergoing very difficult adjustments or slowing growth, especially with declining commodity prices."
101,"But even recently, we’ve seen growth in emerging markets strengthen."
102,"I do want to emphasize that while we have said “gradual,” gradual does not mean mechanical, evenly timed, equally sized interest rate changes."
103,"Well, so the reason—the main reason that we revised down our projection ever so slightly—it’s hardly revised for core inflation—is because we have seen further appreciation of the dollar that’s holding down import prices that spills over into core inflation."
104,"I mean, my own estimation is that core inflation will pick up."
105,"There are various idiosyncratic factors that affect core inflation—for example, nonmarket price increases, which are a little bit hard to understand, have been running at a slow pace."
106,"There were factors that have December 16, 2015 been affecting inflation in medical care prices that may change over time."
107,But I personally don’t think we’re in a world where inflation is being determined in a different way than it has historically.
108,"I see import prices and energy prices as holding down headline but also core, and I do believe it will pick up."
109,"But as we’ve said, if that theory is wrong and we do not see inflation is unfolding in the way the Committee expects, we will make adjustments over time in policy."
110,"I mean, we have many people who are studying inflation models."
111,Monetary policy is based on economic forecasts.
112,"Whether it’s consumer spending or residential investment or inflation, the underlying theories are not perfect, and they are subject to uncertainty."
113,"I’m not aware, I will say, of a different model of inflation that would be superior to the one that we employ."
114,"But we have to verify that inflation is moving in the manner that we expect, and if it’s not, we need to adjust policy accordingly."
115,"On the other hand, there are vulnerabilities there, and there are countries that have been badly affected by declining commodity prices, so we will monitor this very carefully."
116,"So my expectation is that in a strengthening labor market that we would see faster wage growth, and I believe there is, with the 2 percent inflation objective, space for wage growth to be higher than it’s been."
117,We may be seeing some incipient signs of faster wage growth.
118,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy, but it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook."
119,"It also has a bearing on assessing how much slack there is in the labor market, and I think a number of my colleagues looking at the slow pace of wage growth have—you’ve seen that their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate have come down."
120,"So, you know, it does affect views about just how much slack there is in the labor market and the inflation outlook."
