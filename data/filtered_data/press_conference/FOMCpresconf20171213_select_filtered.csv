0,"Our decision reflects our assessment that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law."
1,"Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth stepped up to a solid 3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year."
2,"While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain."
3,"The unemployment rate has declined further in recent months and, at 4.1 percent in November, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
4,We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL ahead.
5,"We anticipate some further strengthening in labor market conditions in the months ahead; however, we expect the pace of job gains to moderate over time as we gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation."
6,"Allowing the labor market to overheat would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly at a later stage, jeopardizing the economic expansion."
7,"Even with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor market, inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objective."
8,"The 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent in October, up a bit from the summer but still below rates seen earlier in the year."
9,Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—has followed a similar pattern and was 1.4 percent in October.
10,We continue to believe that this year’s surprising softness in inflation primarily reflects transitory developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.
11,"As a result, we still expect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years."
12,"Nonetheless, as I’ve noted previously, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect."
13,"As emphasized in our statement, we will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal."
14,"And, as I’ve noted before, we are prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our inflation and employment objectives over the medium term."
15,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook."
16,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2½ percent this year and next and moderates to 2 percent by 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate."
17,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs close to 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
18,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020."
19,"Compared with the projections made in September, real GDP growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate is a bit lower, and inflation is essentially unchanged."
20,"Returning to monetary policy, for the past two years the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability."
21,"But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain a strong labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective."
22,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
23,"As we’ve noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and we do not foresee a need to alter our balance sheet normalization program."
24,"I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of the reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate."
25,"Now, to the extent that the changes do have positive impact on the growth of potential GDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is something that, should it occur, would be very welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives."
26,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation."
27,"But I think, bottom line, when you look at assessments of the funds rate path, participants continue to see gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate as being appropriate to sustain a strong labor market and bring inflation back to 2 percent."
28,"That leaves me—that’s one factor, along with the fact that inflation remains low—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, that the labor market is not overheated at this point."
29,"Remember, the modest pace of wage gains also probably reflects slow productivity growth."
30,"But when you ask me about the outlook for inflation, you know, I’ve talked in detail about this in the past and recognize that there is uncertainty about what’s holding inflation down."
31,But my colleagues and I continue to believe that the factors that are responsible this year for holding inflation down are likely to prove transitory.
32,"That said, we all agree that our inflation objective is extremely important."
33,"This is a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we continue to indicate that we’ll be monitoring inflation developments closely."
34,"So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the likely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but also having some potential to boost aggregate supply."
35,"In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of investment could boost capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential GDP or output to some extent."
36,"And, to the extent that there are larger impacts than those analyses assume on aggregate supply or potential GDP, in the context of an economy that has had disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster GDP growth, at least for some period, without—you know, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that."
37,So there are potentially both demand and supply effects here.
38,"Participants do December 13, 2017 recognize that the unemployment rate is lower than their estimates of its long-run sustainable Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate, so I think we are in the vicinity of full employment."
39,"Well, I think, generally, in a strong labor market where many firms are having difficulty finding qualified workers, we would expect, just through normal demand and supply channels, to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time."
40,"I mean, of course the stock market has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent months characterized the general level of asset valuations as “elevated.” What that reflects is simply the assessment that, looking at price/earnings ratios and comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we see ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’s worth pointing out."
41,"We are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we’ve talked about this repeatedly—likely a low interest rate environment, lower than we’ve had in past decades."
42,"We’re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation, and the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years."
43,"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor."
44,"It is not a stable source of—store of value, and it 1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive levels."
45,"So, look, I will just say that it is up to the Administration and Congress to decide on appropriate fiscal policy, and our job is to maintain our focus on employment and inflation."
46,So right now the FOMC is not discussing or considering its inflation target.
47,"We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years, and I would say—you said our stimulus tools are limited."
48,"So I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunition, but certainly it’s been recognized—and I’ve emphasized myself that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have to December 13, 2017 see how this works out, but we may be in low interest rate environments where it could prove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL useful to have additional scope to conduct monetary policy."
49,"But, look, generally, you see modestly faster growth over the next couple of years, which is consistent and, I said, I think for most participants, reflects partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending."
50,But it’s not a gigantic increase in growth that since—relative to September.
51,"You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also been running low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up."
52,"Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower—that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy."
53,"But, again, counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective."
54,"In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played an active role there—and in monetary policy, and I have confidence that he is very capable of steering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead."
55,"The growth that we’re seeing, it’s not based on, for example, an unsustainable buildup of debt as we had in the run-up December 13, 2017 to the financial crisis."
56,Inflation around the world is generally low.
57,"We’ve got a good, strong labor market and a very low unemployment rate, and I think that’s been tremendously important to the well-being of American households and workers."
58,"We have a 2 percent symmetric inflation objective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent."
59,"And I consider it an important priority to make sure that inflation doesn’t chronically undershoot our 2 percent objective, and I want to see it move up to 2 percent."
60,"So, you know, I think for a number of years—so we’ve had an undershoot of inflation for a number of years."
61,Then we had plummeting oil prices.
62,"And, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked depreciation in the dollar.2 And those three factors held down inflation for a number of years."
63,"Now, in 2016, core inflation came very close to 2 percent."
64,"We seemed to be on a path of inflation moving up, and this year, beginning in March, there seemed to be a sequence of negative surprises."
65,"There may be other factors that are not so easy to name, but we would judge—you know, inflation doesn’t always follow exactly."
66,There are errors and many factors that affect it beyond the key influences of labor market slack: exchange rates and import prices and oil prices.
67,"But there are other factors that affect inflation too, and our judgment at this point is that transitory factors that are unrelated to the broader macroeconomic outlook are holding inflation down."
68,"It’s very important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink what’s determining inflation."
69,"December 13, 2017 rate of unemployment is—it’s been coming down."
70,"It’s not my judgment that inflation expectations have slipped, but that also remains a possibility that needs to be monitored."
71,"So there are—you know, there could be a rethink of inflation."
72,"I think it’s important to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t see inflation moving in the manner that the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we do achieve our 2 percent objective."
73,"So, undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if December 13, 2017 bitcoin were to fall in price, but I really don’t see that as creating a full-blown financial Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL stability risk."
74,And one reason for that is that long-term interest rates generally embody two factors.
75,"One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation—inflation risk."
76,"And typically that means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite restrictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tightening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy."
