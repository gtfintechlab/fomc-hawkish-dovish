0,This accommodative policy should support further progress toward our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
1,"However, recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate."
2,Economic growth was relatively weak late last year and early this year.
3,Some of the factors weighing on growth were expected.
4,"For example, exports have been soft, reflecting subdued foreign demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar."
5,"Also, activity in the energy sector has obviously been hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014."
6,"In addition, growth in household spending slowed noticeably early in the year despite solid increases in household income as well as relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth."
7,This recovery is a key factor supporting the Committee’s expectation that overall economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.
8,"Despite lackluster economic growth, the job market continued to improve early in the year."
9,And the unemployment rate held near 5 percent even though notably more people were actively looking for work.
10,"And while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, that decline occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work."
11,A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time but would rather work full time has flattened out.
12,"On a more positive note, average hourly earnings increased 2½ percent over the past 12 months—a bit faster than in earlier years and a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up."
13,"That said, we will be watching the job market carefully."
14,Ongoing economic growth and an improving labor market underpin our inflation outlook.
15,"Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, still short of our 2 percent objective."
16,Much of this shortfall continues to reflect the effects of earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports.
17,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent."
18,"As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade, and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years."
19,Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
20,"However, we can’t take the stability of longer-run inflation expectations for granted."
21,"While most survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations show little change, on balance, in recent months, financial market measures of inflation compensation have declined."
22,Movements in these indicators reflect many factors and therefore may not provide an accurate reading on changes in the inflation expectations that are most relevant for wages and prices.
23,"Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
24,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depends on each person’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
25,Participants’ projections for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product are slightly lower in the near term than the projections made for the March FOMC meeting.
26,"The median growth projection now remains at 2 percent through 2018, in line with its estimated longer-run rate."
27,"The median projection for the unemployment rate edges down from 4.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.6 percent in the next two years, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
28,The median path of the unemployment rate is little changed from March.
29,"Finally, the median inflation projection stands at 1.4 percent this year, a bit firmer than in March, and then rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018."
30,"Returning to monetary policy, as I said, the Committee maintained its target range for the federal funds rate."
31,"This decision reflects the Committee’s careful approach in setting monetary policy, particularly in light of the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth that I June 15, 2016 have discussed as well as continuing below-target inflation."
32,"Proceeding cautiously in raising our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL interest rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective."
33,"Caution is all the more appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future than to a weakening labor market and falling inflation."
34,"In the current environment of sluggish global growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of, and appetite for, risk can change abruptly."
35,"We expect the rate to remain, for some time, below levels that are anticipated to prevail in the longer run because headwinds weighing on the economy mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards."
36,"These headwinds—which include developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time."
37,"But, if they gradually fade over the next few years as we expect, then the interest rate required to keep the economy operating at an even keel should move higher as well."
38,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
39,"These forecasts represent participants’ individual assessments of appropriate policy given their projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
40,"And I think what we can see, and what many econometric and other studies show, is that the so-called neutral June 15, 2016 rate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL roughly at trend and operating near full employment—that rate is quite depressed by historical standards."
41,"Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation-adjusted terms, near zero."
42,"But there are also more long-lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that are holding down the longer-run level of neutral rates—for example, slow productivity growth, which is not just a U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon."
43,"You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay long for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.1 And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantly reevaluating where is that neutral rate going, and I think what you see is a downward shift in that assessment over time, the sense that maybe more of what’s causing this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not going to be rapidly disappearing but will be part of the new normal."
44,"Now, 1 Chair Yellen intended to say, “You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.” June 15, 2016 you still see an assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has been coming Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL down, and I think it continues to be marked lower."
45,"You know, monetary policy—the Committee feels that monetary policy—when we are looking at several years, we should show the public what the views are of all the participants in the Committee, especially given that voting—voting rotates every year, and so that’s a decision we made."
46,And we’re also looking at the prospects for economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.
47,"The forecast that you see in the SEP and the statement indicate the Committee continues to expect we will have moderate June 15, 2016 growth, 2 percent growth—so, you know, suggests healthy growth for the rest of the year and a Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL pickup in growth in the second quarter, and we expect to see continuing progress in the labor market."
48,"Now, we had questions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter."
49,And we will be watching the spending data to make sure growth is picking up in line with our expectations.
50,"Of course, with respect to inflation, we’re constantly evaluating whether or not incoming information is roughly in line with our expectations."
51,"It may turn out—you know, again, we should never pay too much attention to, for example, one job market report."
52,"There’s a large error around that, we often see large revisions, we should not overblow the significance of one data point, especially when other indicators of the labor market are still flashing green: Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low; perceptions of the labor market remain fine; data from the JOLTS on job openings continue to reach new highs."
53,"And the second factor is the so-called term premium, or the extra yield that investors demand in order to hold a longer-term security instead of to invest short term."
54,"And clearly, market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates over the next 10 years remain low, and that is a factor."
55,"As I said, we have good reason to believe that the so-called neutral rate or rate compatible with the economy operating at full employment is low at the present time."
56,"Clearly, we will be looking at the next job report, and if we were to see a healthy pace of job growth, you know, above that needed to kind of June 15, 2016 maintain the status quo in the labor market."
57,"So, you know, I should say, over time, we should Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job gains is probably going to slow down somewhat."
58,"There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views, but there will be other surveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that we’ll focus—we’ll be focusing on."
59,"You know, I would say, with respect to the behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected; I have really not seen significant surprises there."
60,"We’ve long said that an important reason that inflation is as low as it’s been is because of past declines in energy prices and increases in the value of the dollar, and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up."
61,"And with respect to core inflation, which—now, that’s partly influenced also by the dollar, but trying to pull out the dollar and import price influence—core inflation seems to be behaving roughly as one would expect with well-anchored inflation expectations and in improving labor markets."
62,"So I’m not seeing anything—inflation, even core inflation, is running under 2 percent."
63,"But, we’ve seen in the past, and economic theory suggests, that inflation expectations are relevant to price and wage setting decisions."
64,So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully.
65,"Now, it’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions."
66,"And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of household inflation expectations, move down."
67,And measures of inflation compensation—I always try to be careful to call it “inflation compensation” rather than “inflation expectations” because they’re not inflation expectations.
68,"Inflation expectations influence those market measures, but there’s also an inflation risk premium."
69,And there are actually good reasons to think that the inflation risk premium could have declined significantly and may be depressing those measures.
70,"So we watch them, we’ve taken note in the statement that they’ve moved down, but actual inflation is behaving more or less as would be expected."
71,"But I think if you look at the statement, we pointed to slower growth but pointed out that the fundamentals—there was no obvious fundamental reason for growth to have slowed."
72,So I think that the minimum wage increases that have gone into effect—estimates that I’ve seen suggest it’s a relatively minor influence on the aggregate level of wage inflation.
73,I would take somewhat faster wage increases to be a sign that labor market slack is diminishing and that the labor market is approaching conditions that are consistent with maximum employment.
74,"So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhaps preliminary indications, that wage growth is picking up."
75,"And as much as anything, I think it’s a sign of a generally healthy labor market, which is what our mandated objective is, to achieve maximum employment."
76,"We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or even hyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help them finance it by printing money, and maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is very much aided by having central bank independence."
77,"Now, that said, in unusual times where the concern is with very weak growth or possibly deflation—rather rare circumstances—first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool."
78,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role."
79,"Well, it is conceivable in a scenario when—where growth and inflation really surprise us to the upside that we would have to raise short-term interest rates so rapidly that the rates we would be paying on reserves would exceed what we’re earning on our portfolio."
80,So this does requires an extreme scenario with very rapid increases in short-term interest rates.
81,"This is probably an economy that everybody would feel very pleased—was performing well and better than expected, and where monetary policy—you know, our goal is June 15, 2016 price stability and maximum employment, and we would probably feel that we had done very Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL well in achieving that."
82,"So, we usually make money—we’ve been making a lot of money in recent years, but the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize our income."
83,"So the state of foreign economies, both their growth outlooks and the stance of monetary policy, those are factors that influence the U.S. outlook and influence the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
84,"So, of course, we do look at foreign rates, the prospects—and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy."
85,"Differentials between countries in likely policy paths do tend to spill over into exchange rates—that is a standard part of how monetary policy works—and a stronger dollar, those have a both—a depressing effect."
86,It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed.
87,"At the moment, net exports—well, for quite some time and probably going forward, they will be somewhat of a drag on U.S. growth, so that’s a factor that we take into account."
88,And increases in the dollar that we’ve seen since mid-2014 have served to push inflation down as well; it can also have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.
89,"So, it’s—it is certainly relevant to the stance of U.S. monetary policy and a factor, but when one says “a constraint,” I really would not go so far as to say it is a constraint on monetary June 15, 2016 policy."
90,"When we have an outlook for continuing above-trend growth—that if we held rates Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL absolutely flat, we have reason to believe inflation would overshoot our target—we would see a case to gradually raise rates over time."
91,"At the moment, I think markets do expect, and this is factored into market prices, a gradual path for rates to increase over time."
92,"But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to inflation and had to raise short-term rates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would work would be the associated impact on the dollar."
93,"That is a standard channel through which the monetary policy transmission mechanism works, and we would take it into account and would not feel constrained, but that would be part of how it would work."
94,"Well, oil prices have had many different effects on the economy, and so we’ve been watching oil prices closely."
95,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation."
96,"You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis."
97,"Once they stabilize at whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time."
98,"Not only have they stabilized, they have moved up some, and their inflation is—their impact on inflation is waning over time."
99,"But oil prices have also had a very substantial negative effect on drilling and mining activity that’s led to weakness in investment spending and job loss in manufacturing and, obviously, in the energy sector."
100,"We’ve estimated that since mid-2014, the decline in energy prices and oil prices has probably resulted in gains of about $1,400 per U.S. household, June 15, 2016 and that’s had an offsetting positive impact on spending."
101,"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well."
