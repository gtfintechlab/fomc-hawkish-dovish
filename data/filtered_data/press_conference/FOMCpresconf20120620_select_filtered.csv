0,"Before we get to questions, I’ll summarize today’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the Committee’s decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment about the appropriate path of monetary policy."
1,"The continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative than they would otherwise be, thereby supporting economic recovery."
2,"Business and household spending are increasing at rates consistent with moderate economic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier this year."
3,"Employment gains have been smaller in recent months, and the unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, remains elevated."
4,"In light of these developments, Committee participants have generally marked down their projections for economic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then picking up gradually."
5,"Based on their projections for economic growth, FOMC participants foresee slower progress in reducing unemployment than they did in April."
6,"Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 percent to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, levels that would remain above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rates of unemployment."
7,"In addition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment."
8,"Meanwhile, inflation has declined recently, primarily reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline."
9,"Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium run will run at or below the most consistent with its statutory mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
10,"More specifically, participants’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.2 to 1.7 percent for 2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014."
11,The economic projections submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.
12,The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.
13,"And, moreover, we have stated that we’re prepared to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery in the labor market."
14,"Well, as I’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea."
15,Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems.
16,But I do think that monetary policy still does have some capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial conditions.
17,"Well, I’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset purchase programs, so-called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions."
18,"Well, the interest rates are quite low, and they’re being pushed down more by safe-haven flows and other factors."
19,"That being said, I think we can lower interest rates more."
20,"So, it’s not just the effect on the long-term interest rate, but there’s a broader set of effects that feed through other asset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial conditions which is supportive to the economy."
21,"Unemployment is still too high, but it has come down."
22,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that."
23,"First of all, many Americans are able to take advantage of lower interest rates."
24,"So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect effects."
25,"And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls have increased in the last few years has been disappointing, there have been significant increases, and the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points."
26,"Some of that comes from the broad impact of Fed policy on spending, on investment, and those effects affect the broad public indirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing."
27,I do think that the European situation is slowing U.S. economic growth.
28,"First of all, Europe is, if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products."
29,"More broadly, the effects of European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth."
30,"And more broadly, we’ve seen some slowing in global economic growth more generally, including in Asia, which also has reduced somewhat our ability to export."
31,"Housing usually plays a very important role in economic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because higher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending."
32,"I’m not criticizing that; it’s just a fact, though, that these contractions are affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy."
33,"There’s a bit of an issue here, which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program we announced today, the maturity extension program, is we’re taking longer-term debt off the market in order to induce investors to move into other assets and to lower longer-term interest rates."
34,"Well, I can’t give you any specific numbers because this is ultimately a Committee decision, but what the Committee is going to do is review all the labor market indicators, including unemployment, including participation, and other measures of labor market activity, and try to make a sense—try to get a sense of whether or not the labor market is improving in a sustainable way."
35,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer."
36,"Well, the—in terms of the inflation forecasts, again, I think it should be said, as a preliminary point, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty about them."
37,"As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the types of unconventional programs that are available are—we know less about them, they have various costs and risks, and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial accommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short-term interest rates can be varied freely."
38,"Well, the U.S. economy is in a situation where short-term interest rates are close to zero."
39,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach."
40,"It’s been one of the themes of my own work for a long time, including some of the work I did on the Bank of Japan, that central banks are not out of tools once the short-term interest rate hits zero."
41,"And we have demonstrated through both communications techniques—guidance about future policy, which is something the Japanese have done as well, by the way—and through asset purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done, that central banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery even when short-term interest rates are close to zero."
42,"If—take, for example, I’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to lend."
43,"What we’re lowering is the safe interest rate, the Treasury rate."
44,"So I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, in fact, support lending."
45,"But lower interest rates on securities and other types of assets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for higher-yielding returns, higher-yielding assets in the form of loans to household and businesses."
46,"So it’s great to have a full complement of people, and it will help us do our other work as well as our monetary policy work more effectively."
