44,"The transmission mechanism in a open economy While cross-border capital flows do not interfere with the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence the broad spectrum of interest rates in the United States, they do quickly transmit pressures from changes in U.S. interest rates to the exchange rate and thereby broaden the channels through which monetary policy affects aggregate demand.",LABEL_2,0.9998434782028198
45,"In the closed economy setting, the transmission mechanism runs from increases in the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate targeted by monetary policy, first to longer term interest rates and equity prices and then to aggregate demand.",LABEL_2,0.9997047781944275
46,"Several components of aggregate demand depend importantly on interest rates, particularly longer-term interest rates (specifically, business fixed investment, housing, spending on consumer durables); consumer spending also depends on the net wealth of households and is therefore affected by equity prices.",LABEL_2,0.9996515512466431

48,"Higher U.S. (real) interest rates, relative to foreign rates, raise the demand for dollar-denominated assets, and bring about an appreciation of the dollar which, in turn, stimulates imports and restrains exports.",LABEL_2,0.9998055100440979
49,Net exports as a result become inversely related to U.S. interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.9980884194374084
50,Evidence suggests that the response of net exports to interest rates (via exchange rates) has become larger over time.,LABEL_2,0.9995054006576538
51,The open economy version of the monetary policy transmission mechanism involves three steps: from U.S. interest rates to nominal exchange rates; from nominal exchange rates to the absolute and relative prices of imports and exports; and from the prices of imports and exports to the real volumes of imports and exports and domestic prices.,LABEL_2,0.9992571473121643

58,"The holding period yields of U.S. and foreign assets, each denominated in their home currency, are thereby equated, eliminating the incentive for further changes in asset demands or capital flows.",LABEL_2,0.9997298121452332
59,"That is, the higher interest rate yield on U.S. assets (measured in dollars) is just offset by the expected depreciation in the value of the asset, measured in the foreign currency.",LABEL_1,0.9934398531913757
60,"By the end of the 10-year period, according to this framework, both interest rates and exchange rate would have returned to their original levels.",LABEL_0,0.995969295501709
61,Evidence suggests that the response of the exchange rate to changes in U.S. interest rates (relative to foreign rates) has increased over time.,LABEL_2,0.9996471405029297
62,So increased integration of financial markets across countries appears to have had a more important effect in raising the responsiveness of exchange rates to interest rate developments than in directly connecting interest rates across countries.,LABEL_0,0.8496987223625183
63,From the exchange rate to the relative prices of imports and exports The next step in the transmission mechanism is the pass-through of the exchange rate to the dollar prices of imports and the foreign currency price of U.S. exports.,LABEL_2,0.9998088479042053
64,"An appreciation of the dollar will be gradually partially passed through over time to the price of imports, lowering their price relative to U.S. produced goods.",LABEL_2,0.9998050332069397
65,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.",LABEL_2,0.9998486042022705
66,The result is movements in relative prices that encourage imports and discourage exports.,LABEL_2,0.9998156428337097
67,From relative prices to real import and export volumes The final step in the process is from the relative price of imports and exports to the volumes of real imports and exports.,LABEL_0,0.9694666862487793
68,This depends on the elasticity of the demands for imports and exports with respect to their relative prices and the size of trade flows relative to GDP.,LABEL_0,0.995230495929718
69,"The elasticities of imports and exports with respect to their respective relative prices are estimated to be about unity, and there is no evidence of a shift in this elasticity over the past several decades.",LABEL_2,0.9993151426315308
70,A one percentage point increase in the real exchange rate would increase real imports by one percentage point over a three year period and decrease real exports by a similar percentage.,LABEL_2,0.999782383441925
71,The absolute effect on aggregate demand also depends on initial levels of imports and exports.,LABEL_2,0.9998230338096619
72,"As import and export volumes have been increasing rapidly, the absolute effect of exchange rate changes on aggregate demand and the contribution of the exchange rate channel to the monetary transmission mechanism has been growing over time.",LABEL_2,0.999798595905304
73,"Trends in interest sensitivity If the magnitude of other channels in the transmission mechanism remained unchanged, the growing importance of imports and exports and the increase in the responsiveness of exchange rates to interest rate differentials would have raised the overall responsiveness of aggregate demand to interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.7774113416671753
74,"The net result is that the interest responsiveness of aggregate demand appears to have remained reasonably stable over time, although the sectoral distribution of the overall effect of interest rates has shifted toward net exports and away from housing.",LABEL_2,0.9998212456703186
75,"The response of net exports to changes in U.S. interest rates, via exchange rates, contributes about one-third of the total interest sensitivity of U.S. aggregate demand over both a one-year and three-year interval.",LABEL_2,0.999016523361206
76,It is therefore a very important part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.,LABEL_2,0.9715954065322876
77,How does U.S. monetary policy affect other countries?,LABEL_2,0.9996414184570312
78,"A change in U.S. monetary policy affects foreign economies in three ways -- via exchange rates, interest rates, and income in the United States.",LABEL_2,0.9998366832733154
79,"If the foreign country's currency is pegged to the dollar, for example, there will, of course, be no exchange rate effect vis-à-vis the United States.",LABEL_2,0.9998014569282532
80,"An increase in U.S. interest rates, however, would put downward pressure on the foreign currency and require the country to raise domestic interest rates to maintain the fixed exchange rate.",LABEL_2,0.9997333884239197
81,"Therefore, foreign interest rates are very likely to have to rise with U.S. rates in this case.",LABEL_2,0.9998395442962646
82,The restraining effect of the rise in foreign interest rates will be reinforced by the effect of the deceleration in U.S. demand for foreign goods induced by the slowdown in U.S. income.,LABEL_2,0.9996399879455566
83,"As a result, a tightening of monetary policy is likely to have an unambiguously restrictive impact on those countries whose exchange rates are pegged to the dollar.",LABEL_2,0.9997946619987488
84,"For countries with floating exchange rates, on the other hand, the exchange rate and income effects of rising U.S. interest rates are likely to be offsetting.",LABEL_1,0.9963958859443665
85,"The appreciation of the dollar, of course, implies a depreciation in other countries' exchange rates; the depreciation will stimulate foreign aggregate demand by raising net exports.",LABEL_1,0.9992005228996277
86,Offsetting this will be the effect of the decline in U.S. income on the demand for foreign countries' exports.,LABEL_0,0.9762226343154907

92,It is useful to distinguish three ways in which global developments might recently be contributing to restraining inflation in the United States.,LABEL_2,0.99983811378479
93,"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.",LABEL_2,0.9996199607849121
94,"Second, the absence of synchronous expansions among the major industrial countries - specifically the much weaker expansions in continental Europe and the still weaker condition of the Japanese economy - has prevented the pressures on worldwide commodity markets that often accompany U.S. expansions and has perhaps also encouraged greater price competitiveness than would otherwise have been the case.",LABEL_2,0.9998094439506531
95,"Third, increased international competitive pressures, associated with growing openness of the U.S. economy, might be restraining inflation.",LABEL_2,0.999848484992981
96,But I wonder whether we would be talking about the contribution of globalization to U.S. inflation performance if the dollar had been stable for the last several years and the expansions in Europe and Japan were as robust as in the U.S.,LABEL_2,0.539436399936676
97,Are there additional objectives for monetary policy in a global environment?,LABEL_2,0.9348013401031494
98,Congress has set dual objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: price stability and full employment.,LABEL_0,0.9826116561889648
99,These objectives relate directly to the performance of the domestic economy and they are also objectives that monetary policy has the ability to pursue in the closed economy setting.,LABEL_2,0.5458482503890991
