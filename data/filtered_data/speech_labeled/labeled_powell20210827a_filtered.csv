3,"As is typically the case, the recovery in employment has lagged that in output; nonetheless, employment gains have also come faster than expected.4 The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.",LABEL_2,0.91764897108078

9,These favorable conditions for job seekers should help the economy cover the considerable remaining ground to reach maximum employment.,LABEL_1,0.8352144956588745
10,"The unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 percent, a post-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the reported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.5 Long-term unemployment remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the rest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.",LABEL_1,0.9959200620651245

12,The Path Ahead: Inflation The rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation.,LABEL_0,0.992417573928833
13,"Over the 12 months through July, measures of headline and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectivelyâ€”well above our 2 percent longer-run objective.7 Businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure on prices and wages.",LABEL_1,0.9595253467559814

16,The absence so far of broad-based inflation pressures The spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.,LABEL_1,0.9994791150093079
17,Durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12â€‘month measures of headline and core inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9996694326400757

19,"In addition, some pricesâ€”for example, for hotel rooms and airplane ticketsâ€”declined sharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels.",LABEL_2,0.9994864463806152
20,"The 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9907393455505371
21,"These effects, which are adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.",LABEL_2,0.9286425113677979
22,We consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price increases for particular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9505791068077087
23,These measures generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 3).,LABEL_1,0.9887781739234924

26,"Used car prices, for example, appear to have stabilized; indeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall.",LABEL_2,0.9987899661064148
27,"If that continues, as many analysts predict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for much of the past decade.8 This same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and, in some cases, reversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally.",LABEL_1,0.9994598031044006
28,"Over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).9 As supply problems have begun to resolve, inflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall.",LABEL_2,0.62223881483078
29,It seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to overall inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9995438456535339
30,Wages We also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.,LABEL_0,0.925025224685669
31,"But if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses would likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of ""wageâ€“price spiral"" seen at times in the past.10 Today we see little evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6).",LABEL_2,0.8025606870651245

33,"Longer-term inflation expectations Policymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998598098754883
34,Our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term expectations at 2 percent is important for both maximum employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9997954964637756
35,We carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations.,LABEL_1,0.9693061709403992
36,"Because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common patterns across the measures.",LABEL_1,0.9989845156669617
37,"One approach to summarizing these patterns is the Board staff's index of common inflation expectations (CIE), which combines information from a broad range of survey and market-based measures.11 This index captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation was running persistently below 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9996757507324219
38,"Longer-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12 5.",LABEL_0,0.5073174238204956
39,"The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter century Finally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced economies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7).",LABEL_2,0.9997525811195374
40,"The pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology, globalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful commitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13 In the United States, unemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9998706579208374
41,Wages did move up across the income spectrumâ€”a welcome developmentâ€”but not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2 percent.,LABEL_0,0.9963955283164978
42,"While the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated.",LABEL_1,0.9994348883628845
43,It seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.14 We will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these assessments.,LABEL_0,0.9646099805831909

46,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,LABEL_2,0.988471508026123
47,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.",LABEL_0,0.9951112866401672
48,The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more.,LABEL_2,0.9807571172714233
49,The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired.,LABEL_2,0.7889147400856018
50,"We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.16 History also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that inflation due to transitory factors will fade.",LABEL_2,0.9998358488082886
51,"The 1970s saw two periods in which there were large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time.",LABEL_2,0.9998195767402649
52,"But when the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run persistently higher than before.",LABEL_0,0.9978355765342712
53,"One likely contributing factor was that the public had come to generally expect higher inflationâ€”one reason why we now monitor inflation expectations so carefully.17 Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time.",LABEL_2,0.9998507499694824
54,"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.",LABEL_0,0.9953659772872925
55,"Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supplyâ€“demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic.",LABEL_1,0.7632539868354797
56,That brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy.,LABEL_1,0.9983453750610352

63,"We have said that we will continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment, and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_0,0.9983762502670288
