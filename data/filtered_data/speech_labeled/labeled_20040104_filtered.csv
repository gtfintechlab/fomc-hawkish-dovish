19,The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years.,LABEL_1,0.9366474747657776
20,"Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices.",LABEL_0,0.9980378746986389
21,"I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.",LABEL_1,0.9372943043708801
22,"When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's hourly productivity--the historically normal situation--then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise.",LABEL_0,0.7848285436630249
23,"Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past three years.",LABEL_2,0.9998356103897095
24,"A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both.",LABEL_1,0.9989678859710693

26,"To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2 The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market.",LABEL_1,0.9910861849784851

34,"Although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market.",LABEL_0,0.982541024684906
35,"All else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees.",LABEL_2,0.9685733914375305
36,"Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3 To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.990160346031189
37,"First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline.",LABEL_2,0.9884968996047974

46,"Price stability is of utmost importance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary to be sure that inflation remains well contained.",LABEL_1,0.9772098660469055
47,"With that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices.",LABEL_2,0.9297520518302917
48,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.",LABEL_1,0.9963014125823975
49,"This acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the behavior of the core producer price indexes (PPIs) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the best and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing.",LABEL_1,0.9995081424713135
50,Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?,LABEL_1,0.9993290901184082
51,"First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle.",LABEL_1,0.9680573344230652
52,"The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.4 The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003.",LABEL_1,0.9333391785621643
53,"The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices.",LABEL_1,0.9994146823883057
54,"Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.",LABEL_2,0.9996201992034912
55,"Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.5 A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices.",LABEL_1,0.856918215751648
56,"Thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate.",LABEL_1,0.9993973970413208
57,"In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.",LABEL_2,0.9867521524429321
58,Two specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude petroleum.,LABEL_2,0.9992333650588989
59,"The price of gold has increased roughly 60 percent since its low in April 2001, from about $255 per ounce to about $410 per ounce.",LABEL_2,0.9960232973098755
60,"Gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and I agree that there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9988996982574463
61,"But gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly heightened since 2001 and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real price of gold.",LABEL_2,0.9998175501823425
62,"Oil prices are relatively high, in the range of $33/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of the past four years, despite a broadly disinflationary environment.",LABEL_1,0.6730677485466003
63,"According to futures markets, oil prices are expected to decline gradually over the next two years, despite accelerating economic activity, as new supplies are brought on line.",LABEL_2,0.9094097018241882
64,"Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of oil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions.",LABEL_2,0.9833900332450867
65,"But if it follows the course projected by the futures market, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in the next couple of years.",LABEL_1,0.9836889505386353
66,Let me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9699347615242004
67,"Moreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases, appear to be relatively small.",LABEL_1,0.6844098567962646
68,"Perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests that foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather than ""passing through"" these effects to the prices they charge U.S. consumers.",LABEL_0,0.9794921875
69,"The extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that foreign producers also lack ""pricing power"" in the current low-inflation environment in the United States.",LABEL_2,0.9968835711479187
70,"Overall, on rough estimates, a 10 percent decline in the broad value of the dollar would be expected to add between one and three tenths to the level of core consumer prices (not the inflation rate), spread out over a period of time.",LABEL_0,0.9937177896499634
71,"I haven't said anything yet about the rate of growth of the money supply, another indicator that is sometimes cited by those concerned about inflation, largely because there is not too much to say.",LABEL_1,0.9046772718429565
72,"Growth in standard monetary measures such as the base and M2 has been moderate (and declining) in recent years, certainly well within expected ranges given the growth of nominal GDP and normal variation in velocity.",LABEL_2,0.9998065829277039
73,"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.",LABEL_2,0.9995142221450806
74,"Even should money growth rates accelerate, however, I would caution against making strong inferences about the likely behavior of inflation, except in the very long run.",LABEL_0,0.7547882795333862
75,"Money growth has not proven to be especially useful for predicting inflation in the short run, in part because various institutional factors unrelated to monetary policy often affect the growth rate of money.",LABEL_1,0.9977927207946777
76,"A striking example of the way special factors can affect money growth rates is the fact that M2 growth has actually been sharply negative, at about -5 percent at an annual rate, for the past three months for which data are available.",LABEL_2,0.9995256662368774
77,"Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!6 To summarize, 2003 seems to have marked the turning point for the U. S. economy, and we have reason to be optimistic that 2004 will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing unemployment.",LABEL_2,0.9986298084259033
78,"The Federal Reserve enters 2004 with monetary policy that is unusually accommodative in historical terms, relative to the stage of the business cycle.",LABEL_2,0.9997172951698303
79,"That accommodation is justified, I believe, by the current very low level of inflation, and by the productivity gains and the weakness in the labor market, both of which suggest that inflation is likely to remain subdued.",LABEL_2,0.9993200302124023
