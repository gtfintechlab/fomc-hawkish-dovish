61,"To see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate, it's helpful to start with equation (1) on slide 6, which states that in a steady state (that is, when the unemployment rate is constant), flows into unemployment, the left side of equation (1), must equal flows out of unemployment, the right side.",LABEL_2,0.9762149453163147

67,"On the one hand, if the workers searching for jobs are well suited for the jobs that are available, matching efficiency will be high; on the other hand, if many searching workers are not well suited for the available jobs, matching efficiency will be low.6 The last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation (2), the steady-state unemployment rate, yielding equation (5).",LABEL_2,0.9993442893028259

81,"If there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that tempers labor demand, then vacancies should fall substantially.",LABEL_2,0.9996769428253174
82,"Then we should travel down the curve from point A to point B.8 The unemployment rate will increase, but only somewhat because labor demand is still strongâ€”just not as strongâ€”and because when the labor market is very tight, as it is now, vacancies generate relatively few hires.",LABEL_2,0.6215338706970215
83,"Thus, reducing vacancies from an extremely high level to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on unemployment.",LABEL_2,0.999707043170929
