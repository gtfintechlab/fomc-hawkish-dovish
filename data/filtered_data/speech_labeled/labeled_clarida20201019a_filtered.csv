2,"October 19, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and Initiatives to Sustain the Flow of Credit to Households and Firms Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.",LABEL_2,0.9994471669197083
3,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.",LABEL_0,0.9985321760177612
4,This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new COVID-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.,LABEL_1,0.9993289709091187
5,These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal supportâ€”including expanded unemployment benefits and the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)â€”as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.,LABEL_0,0.8901894092559814
6,"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.",LABEL_0,0.9979585409164429
7,It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.,LABEL_0,0.9965006113052368
8,"However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee's baseline projections summarized in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little more than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9979656934738159
9,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",LABEL_2,0.8382444381713867
10,"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",LABEL_2,0.9993100166320801
11,"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_0,0.9986749291419983
12,"Concluding Remarks While recovery since the spring collapse in economic activity has been robust, let us not forget that the full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go, with the unemployment rate still elevated at 7.9 percent as of September and inflation still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective.",LABEL_0,0.9979786276817322
13,"It will take some time to return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetaryâ€”and likely fiscalâ€”policy will be needed.",LABEL_0,0.9994117021560669
