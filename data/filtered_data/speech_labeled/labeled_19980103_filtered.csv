1,Of mounting importance is a deeper understanding of the economic characteristics of sustained price stability.,LABEL_1,0.9821215867996216

5,"Of course, this signaling process, which involves individual prices, would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure aggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy.",LABEL_2,0.9998350143432617
6,"Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices.",LABEL_2,0.9998241066932678

8,"Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments, not only involving inflation, but also involving real output and productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9995059967041016
9,"If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in real GDP and productivity, and real incomes and living standards are rising faster than our published data suggest.",LABEL_2,0.9998239874839783
10,"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid actions based on inaccurate premises that will provoke undesired consequences.",LABEL_0,0.957342803478241
11,"Clearly, central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.",LABEL_2,0.999803364276886
12,"Moreover, many economic transactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index, most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may, nevertheless, take such an index into account less formally.",LABEL_2,0.9983286261558533
13,"If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economic transactions will lead to suboptimal outcomes.",LABEL_2,0.9995577931404114
14,The remarkable progress that has been made by virtually all of the major industrial countries in achieving low rates of inflation in recent years has brought the issue of price measurement into especially sharp focus.,LABEL_2,0.9998457431793213

19,"Nonetheless, a drop in the prices of existing assets can feed back onto real economic activity, not only by changing incentives to consume and invest, but also by impairing the health of financial intermediaries--as we experienced in the early 1990s and many Asian countries are learning now.",LABEL_0,0.9697067141532898
20,"But historically, it has been very rapid asset price declines--in equity and real estate, especially--that have held the potential to be a virulently negative force in the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9997836947441101
21,"I emphasize rapid declines because, in most circumstances, slowly deflating asset prices probably can be absorbed without the marked economic disruptions that frequently accompany sharp corrections.",LABEL_0,0.9981192946434021
22,"The severe economic contraction of the early 1930s, and the associated persistent declines in product prices, could probably not have occurred apart from the steep asset price deflation that started in 1929.",LABEL_0,0.9832872152328491
23,"While asset price deflation can occur for a number of reasons, a persistent deflation in the prices of currently produced goods and services--just like a persistent increase in these prices--necessarily is, at its root, a monetary phenomenon.",LABEL_2,0.771111249923706
24,"Just as changes in monetary conditions that involve a flight from money to goods cause inflation, the onset of deflation involves a flight from goods to money.",LABEL_0,0.9969671368598938
25,Both rapid or variable inflation and deflation can lead to a state of fear and uncertainty that is associated with significant increases in risk premiums and corresponding shortfalls in economic activity.,LABEL_0,0.9639934301376343
26,"Even a moderate rate of inflation can hamper economic performance, as I have emphasized many times before; and although we do not have any recent experience, moderate rates of deflation would most probably lead to similar problems.",LABEL_0,0.6986574530601501
27,"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.",LABEL_1,0.9949960708618164

29,But deflation can be detrimental for reasons that go beyond those that are also associated with inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9110504388809204
30,"Nominal interest rates are bounded at zero, hence deflation raises the possibility of potentially significant increases in real interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9995935559272766
31,"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.",LABEL_2,0.8043026328086853
32,"A deflation that took place in an environment of rapid productivity growth, however, might be largely immune from some of these special problems.",LABEL_1,0.9980568289756775

34,"Although real interest rates may be quite high in terms of this sector's declining product prices, rapid productivity growth has ensured that real rates of return are higher still, and investment in this sector has been robust.",LABEL_2,0.9986836314201355
35,"In this sense, the choice of a specific, sometimes arbitrary, definition of real output and hence of price by government statisticians is essentially a descriptive issue, and not one that directly affects firms' investment decisions.",LABEL_2,0.9873664379119873
36,This is an illustration of where even individual price measurement probably is not always of direct and fundamental importance for private sector behavior.,LABEL_1,0.9985162615776062
37,"If such high-tech, high-productivity-growth firms produce an increasing share of output in the decades ahead, then, one could readily imagine the economy experiencing an overall product price deflation in which the problems associated with a zero constraint on nominal interest rates or nominal wage changes would seldom be binding.",LABEL_2,0.9998528957366943

45,"At first glance, observing and measuring prices might not appear especially daunting.",LABEL_2,0.9998395442962646
46,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,LABEL_2,0.99982088804245
47,"Defining such a constant-quality unit of output, of course, is the central conceptual difficulty in price measurement.",LABEL_2,0.9997839331626892
