(via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance (IIF) Washington Policy Summit.1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, but I do hope next time we will be gathering together in Washington.",LABEL_2,0.9997429251670837

4,"Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at a roughly 31.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2020, more than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April, and the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April.",LABEL_0,0.9963449835777283

6,"As shown in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' projections for 2021 GDP growth is 6.5 percent.2 If these projections are realized, GDP will grow at the fastest four-quarter pace since 1984.",LABEL_1,0.9990004897117615
7,"And, as this is a virtual meeting of the IIF, I would be remiss if I did not highlight that if these projections for U.S. economic activity are realized, rising U.S. imports will serve as an important source of external demand to the rest of the world this year and beyond.",LABEL_1,0.9763134121894836
8,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have recently improved.",LABEL_2,0.995081901550293

10,"Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole.",LABEL_0,0.9992276430130005
11,"The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and the misclassification of some workers on temporary layoff as employed, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9986575841903687
12,"It is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the FOMC presented in the latest SEP released last week, my colleagues and I substantially revised up our outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis.",LABEL_1,0.9979966282844543
13,"In particular, the median FOMC participant now projects the unemployment rate to reach 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",LABEL_1,0.9831181764602661
14,"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.",LABEL_2,0.997835099697113
15,"Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move temporarily above our 2 percent longer-run goal, owing to a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded in the spring of 2020 and supply bottlenecks limiting how quickly production can respond in the near term.",LABEL_0,0.9927225708961487
16,"However, I expect most of this increase to be transitory and for inflation to return toâ€”or perhaps run somewhat aboveâ€”our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.",LABEL_2,0.9245468974113464
17,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.",LABEL_1,0.9905104041099548
18,This means that following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percentâ€”as has been the case for most of the past decadeâ€”monetary policy will aim for inflation to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,LABEL_0,0.9240243434906006
19,"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.",LABEL_2,0.9995235204696655
20,"As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.4 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",LABEL_0,0.9963153004646301
21,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_0,0.6172072291374207
22,We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,LABEL_0,0.944851279258728

24,"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.",LABEL_2,0.9697743058204651
25,"""5 This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.",LABEL_2,0.9555801153182983
26,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9997230172157288
27,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",LABEL_2,0.9989749193191528
28,"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to ""flexible average inflation targeting.",LABEL_1,0.9916929602622986
29,"""6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”that remain unchanged.7 Concluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.",LABEL_1,0.9976012110710144
