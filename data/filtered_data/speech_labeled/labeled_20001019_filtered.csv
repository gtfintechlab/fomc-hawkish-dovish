62,A similar sluggish adjustment of nominal wages to productivity developments following the productivity slowdown in the early 1970s may have contributed to the sharp increase in inflation thereafter.3 Let me try to make a rough estimate of the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity and the associated decline in the short-run NAIRU.,LABEL_1,0.9480698108673096
63,The first step is to estimate the acceleration in trend productivity.,LABEL_0,0.9758961200714111
64,If productivity has increased from 1-1/2 percent during the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s to the upper end of the estimate today--say 3-1/2 percent--then the total acceleration in productivity would be 2 percentage points.,LABEL_1,0.5702661871910095

73,"As you can see, this upper-end estimate is that the cumulative productivity acceleration is lowering inflation today by 1-1/2 percentage points, for any given unemployment rate.",LABEL_0,0.9975772500038147
74,"Note that when this effect is positive, as it has been since the mid-1990s, it is a disinflationary effect and when it is negative--as it was following the decline in trend productivity growth after the early 1970s--it is an inflationary effect.",LABEL_2,0.5937981605529785
75,The power and persistence of the direct disinflationary effect depends on both the pattern of the productivity acceleration and the speed of the adjustment process--specifically how fast wages respond directly to the productivity acceleration.,LABEL_0,0.9723142385482788
76,"If the adjustment is very drawn out as shown in figure 2, then the direct disinflationary effect would have been quite large and this effect would continue to be important for some time, even once productivity growth stabilizes.",LABEL_0,0.9975142478942871
77,"But if the adjustment were more rapid, the disinflationary effects of the acceleration in productivity would have been less powerful and would dissipate more rapidly once productivity growth stabilizes.",LABEL_0,0.9964480400085449
78,These alternative moving averages translate into a range of 1/2 to 1-1/2 percentage points for the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity growth.,LABEL_0,0.9913995265960693
79,"In figure 3, I have assumed that the long-run NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent and that the long-run NAIRU has varied over the period from 1960 until today only in response to the effect of demographic changes on the average unemployment rate.4 As I explain in somewhat more detail in the appendix, I estimate the short-run NAIRU by subtracting the direct disinflationary effect of changes in trend productivity from the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.",LABEL_2,0.9992863535881042
