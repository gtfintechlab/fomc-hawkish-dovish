0,Market prices appeared to respond mainly to signs of stabilization in the U. S. and global economies and to developments associated with trade policy.
1,"Regarding expectations for U. S. monetary policy, the Open Market Trading Desk's surveys and market-based indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
2,"Survey- and market-implied uncertainty about the near-term outlook for monetary policy declined, with market commentary attributing the decrease in part to the Committee's October communications."
3,"Money market rates are often volatile around year-end, and Federal Reserve operations are not intended to eliminate all year-end pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply remains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy."
4,Purchases of these short-dated securities would not affect broader financial conditions or the stance of monetary policy.
5,"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October."
6,Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.
7,"Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in November, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in October."
8,"However, the rate of increase in payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020."
9,The unemployment rate ticked up in October but then moved back down to its 50-year low of 3.
10,"5 percent in November; the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio held steady, on balance, over those two months."
11,"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past two months; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
12,The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through late November remained near historically low levels.
13,"In general, recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be moderate."
14,The employment cost index for private-sector workers rose 2.

16,Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.
17,"6 percent over that same 12-month period, while consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation and consumer energy prices declined."
18,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in October.
19,The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.
20,"1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core CPI inflation was 2."
21,"Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Survey of Consumer Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed, on balance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in early December to the bottom of its recent range after ticking up in November."
22,"Key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low interest rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
23,"Most measures of business sentiment were still downbeat, analysts' expectations of firms' longer-term profit growth edged down further, and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms' investment decisions."
24,"Overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, slow economic growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments."
25,The nominal U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in October.
26,"Available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly negative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter."

31,"On net, equity prices increased moderately while corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly."
32,Financing conditions for businesses and households remained supportive of spending and economic activity.
33,A straight read of the probability distribution for the federal funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting.
34,Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased slightly from near multiyear low levels.
35,Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed to trade-related developments and stronger-than-expected U. S. employment reports.
36,"Most foreign equity price indexes and long-term sovereign yields in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan increased modestly on net."
37,CRE loan growth at banks also increased in October relative to recent quarters.

40,"Credit card debt grew at a solid pace, and interest rates on credit card debt began to fall."
41,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was revised up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the previous projection.
42,"The forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term was also revised up a bit, on balance, primarily in response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices."
43,"Nevertheless, real GDP growth was still expected to slow modestly in the coming years, largely because of a fading boost from fiscal policy."
44,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.
45,The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through 2022 and to remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
46,"The staff's forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2019 was revised down a bit, as a downward revision to core PCE prices in response to recent data was partly offset by an upward revision to consumer energy prices."
47,"Beyond 2019, core inflation was expected to be above its pace this year, and this projection was revised up a touch because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current forecast."
48,The projection for total inflation in 2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices.
49,"Over the remainder of the medium-term projection, total inflation was expected to be about the same as core inflation, al­though both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022."
50,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
51,"The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
52,"In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
53,"The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity."
54,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
55,"The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
56,Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
57,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
58,"On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
59,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
60,"Participants generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
61,"This outlook reflected, at least in part, the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy."
62,"Nevertheless, global developments, related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad, continued to pose some risks to the outlook, and inflation pressures remained muted."
63,Many participants commented that business contacts in consumer-related industries reported strong demand or that contacts were optimistic about the holiday retail spending season.
64,"With respect to the business sector, participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global economic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports."
65,A few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years.
66,"A few participants remarked that activity in the energy sector was especially weak, reflecting low petroleum prices, low profitability, and tight financing conditions for energy-producing firms."
67,"Several participants noted that the agricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties, including those associated with trade developments, weak export demand, and challenging financial positions for many farmers."
68,"Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some measures of labor force participation increasing further."
69,"The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources."
70,"Moreover, measures of wage growth had generally remained moderate."
71,"In addition, a couple of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year."
72,"Business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms reporting difficulties in finding qualified workers or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
73,"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, had continued to run below 2 percent."
74,"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, and market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low."
75,A few participants commented on factors that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months.
76,"Assessing all these factors, participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and resource utilization remained high."
77,"However, weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment."
78,Participants who expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased or that global or technology-related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome.
79,Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity.
80,"In addition, there were indications that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing."
81,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
82,"As reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook."
83,A number of participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the Committee some time to assess the full effects on the economy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year along with other information bearing on the economic outlook.
84,Participants also discussed how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the global developments that have been weighing on economic activity and for returning inflation to the Committee's symmetric objective of 2 percent.
85,Participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent.
86,"Al­though a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory, various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expectations was too low."
87,"A few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risk-taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector."
88,These participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low.
89,"They remarked that such policies could be inconsistent with sustaining maximum employment, could make the next recession more severe than otherwise, or could strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential tools to guard against emerging imbalances."
90,"Various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings."

92,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
93,"On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
94,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
95,"Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
96,"Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
97,"And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
98,"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to state that they judged that ""the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate"" to support the achievement of the Committee's policy objectives."
99,Members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement.
100,"With the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on uncertainties about the outlook could be removed."
101,"A few members suggested that the language stating that monetary policy would support inflation ""near"" 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level; they preferred language that referred to returning inflation to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
102,"Other members thought that the reference to ""near"" 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent."
103,"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."

110,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
111,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
112,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1."
