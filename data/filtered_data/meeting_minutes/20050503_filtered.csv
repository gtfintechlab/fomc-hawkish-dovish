2,"Consumers appeared to have turned somewhat cautious in their spending, likely a reflection of higher energy prices."
3,"Sharp increases in energy prices pushed up headline inflation, and core measures were also somewhat elevated."
4,The unemployment rate moved down to 5.
5,"Other factors underlying consumer spending also remained favorable: Real wages and salaries continued to rise, and the ratio of wealth to income remained high, although it was down a bit because of a decline in equity prices."
6,"House prices continued to rise rapidly over the first quarter, although recent data suggested some slowing."
7,"This performance reflected favorable underlying fundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained earnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions in the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and loan markets."

11,Consumer price inflation abroad remained subdued.
12,U. S. consumer price inflation firmed in recent months as energy prices rose sharply.
13,"Core consumer prices also rose a bit more rapidly recently, but the increase over the twelve months ending in March was little different than over the year-earlier period."
14,"According to survey information, expectations of near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase in energy prices."
15,"As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace."
16,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
17,The Committee also noted that economic output continued to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices and that labor market conditions continued to improve gradually.
18,"While pressures on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power was more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained."
19,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
20,"The FOMC's decision in March to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points was fully anticipated by the market, as were its retention in the accompanying statement of the ""measured pace"" language and its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth were balanced."
21,"Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response to the statement's references to increased price pressures and to more evident pricing power as well as to the Committee's conditioning of its risk assessment on ""appropriate monetary policy action. """
22,"Further downward pressure on interest rates was exerted by the market's response to the release of the minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference to Committee members' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening was not necessary at that time."

28,"Fiscal policy was expected to provide a more moderate impetus to growth this year and next, following the substantial boost estimated for earlier years."
29,"Although economic growth was projected to run a bit above the staff's estimate of the economy's potential, the unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into the labor force."
30,"Inflation was projected to edge lower over the rest of the year and into 2006, reflecting the attenuation of the impact of higher energy prices and the effects of a slowed rate of growth of import prices and remaining slack in resource markets."
31,"In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook, meeting participants observed that incoming data over the intermeeting period hinted at possible upside risks for inflation and downside risks for economic growth."
32,Earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an important factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and a slower pace of economic activity.
33,"With energy prices leveling out more recently, however, and the behavior of compensation suggesting a lack of pressure in labor markets, underlying inflation appeared to remain contained."
34,"On balance, economic fundamentals including low interest rates, robust underlying productivity growth, and strengthened business balance sheets were expected to support economic growth at a pace sufficient to gradually eliminate remaining slack in resource utilization."
35,"Although the economic outlook generally seemed favorable, there was also broad recognition of greater uncertainty attending the outlook for both inflation and output growth."
36,"In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices, the sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist for some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going forward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future and wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or taking on new workers."

38,Higher gasoline prices seemed to be sapping consumer confidence and consumer spending.

40,"On balance, though, strong income growth and low interest rates augured well for household spending."
41,"House price appreciation was expected to moderate over coming quarters, but a number of local real estate markets were still regarded as ""hot, "" with signs of possible speculative excesses in some areas."
42,A relatively high proportion of demand had continued to be met by imports.
43,"Some concern was expressed that incoming data suggested weaker growth in some of our major trading partners, which posed a downside risk to forecasts for U. S. exports."
44,"Moreover, advances in domestic income were expected to contribute to brisk growth in imports."
45,"Looking ahead, the U. S. economy was expected to continue to run quite substantial current account deficits, although the impact of past dollar depreciation should work to boost exports and slow the rise in imports to some extent."
46,Recent energy price developments garnered considerable attention.
47,"Declines in energy prices in recent weeks were viewed as welcome, but participants noted that far-dated futures prices for oil remained quite elevated and that persistently high energy prices could trigger a range of deleterious effects on the economy."
48,High energy prices appeared to be taking a toll on household and business confidence and might be beginning to crimp corporate profits.
49,"Indeed, some portion of recent elevated inflation readings probably represented, at least partly, such pass-through effects from higher energy costs."
50,"However, while pass-through effects could leave the overall price level higher, their impact on inflation should fade over time, as long as inflation expectations remain well contained."
51,"Still, considerable uncertainty surrounded the degree of pass-through from energy prices to core consumer prices, and pass-through effects might be more pronounced when energy price increases were perceived as more likely to be permanent."
52,"Persistently high energy prices were mentioned as a factor that could trim the level of potential output to a small degree over time, possibly contributing to additional upward pressure on consumer prices at the margin."
53,Participants voiced concerns about recent price trends; they expected inflation to remain contained but also perceived that the risks to that inflation outlook now might be skewed somewhat to the upside.
54,Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.
55,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months."
56,"Moreover, there were risks that the relative stability of long-term survey measures of inflation expectations could simply reflect lags in households' perceptions of changing economic prospects."
57,The success that some businesses seemed to be encountering in passing through cost increases raised the possibility that competitive pressures and resource slack were exerting somewhat less restraint on inflation than had been anticipated.
58,"However, available indicators of wages and benefits had registered only modest growth, suggesting to many that some slack in labor markets persisted."
59,"Moreover, market measures of inflation compensation had ebbed in recent weeks, and survey measures of long-term inflation expectations, albeit a touch higher of late, remained in the broad range of recent years."
60,"Along with energy prices, import and materials prices apparently had contributed to the recent uptick in inflation, and pressures on inflation stemming from these three sources were expected to lessen over coming quarters."
61,"On balance, measures of core inflation were thought likely to remain in check over the remainder of this year and next."
62,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3 percent at this meeting."
63,"Although downside risks to sustainable growth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower growth of economic activity as likely to be transitory."
64,"To be sure, the Committee had raised its federal funds rate target appreciably over the past year, and, in the view of a few members, a larger-than-expected moderation of aggregate demand in response to this cumulative policy action could not be ruled out."
65,"However, all members regarded the stance of policy as accommodative and judged that the current level of short-term rates remained too low to be consistent with sustainable growth and stable prices in the long run."
66,"Against the backdrop of the recent uptick in core inflation and in some measures of inflation expectations, members agreed that they should continue along the course of removing policy accommodation at a measured pace conditional on the outlook for inflation and economic growth."
67,"In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that rising energy prices seemed to have spurred an increase in core measures of inflation by dropping the reference from the March statement indicating that ""The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices. """
68,"They likewise all agreed that mention should be made that, on balance, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained."
69,"Regarding the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted that the risk assessment conditioned on ""appropriate policy"" no longer seemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee's economic and policy outlook."
70,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy."
71,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
72,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
73,"With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
74,"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. """
