0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent months.
2,"Housing demand remained at a high level, and deepening trade deficits provided only a partial offset to the strength in domestic spending."
3,"Against this background, employment and production posted further large gains."
4,Price inflation remained subdued despite tight labor markets and some pickup in the rate of wage increases.
5,Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in October and November.
6,"Manufacturing employment also rose considerably further in November, and aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers registered a particularly large advance in that month."
7,The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.
8,"It featured particularly strong growth in the production of durable goods, including a surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts."
9,"The flat sales for the two months reflected some softening in the durable goods category, notably at automotive dealers, and relatively slow growth in the nondurable goods sector."
10,"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions."
11,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services was significantly larger in the third quarter than in the second.
12,"Economic growth in most major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the third quarter, and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggested continued above-trend expansion."
13,"However, growth since midyear appeared to have recovered only modestly in Japan from a sharp second-quarter decline."
14,The ongoing financial turmoil affecting a number of Asian economies had led to a significant slowdown in economic activity in the region.
15,"Consumer price inflation had remained at a low level in recent months, reflecting a variety of influences including a favorable labor cost environment, falling import prices, small increases in energy prices, and declining inflation expectations."
16,"For the twelve months ended in November, overall consumer prices and consumer prices excluding food and energy items increased appreciably less than in the year-earlier period."
17,"At the producer level, prices for finished goods edged lower in November and the index was down somewhat on balance over the past year, reflecting declines in the food and energy components."
18,Such a bias had been seen as consistent with the members' views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.
19,Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
20,"In other domestic financial markets, short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on November 12, 1997, while bond yields fell somewhat."
21,Share prices in U. S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period.
22,"Domestic financial markets became somewhat less volatile over the period, though further turmoil in a number of foreign markets fostered a sense of unease that was reflected in relatively wide yield spreads and, on occasion, in trading activity and price movements."
23,The dollar's appreciation against the German mark and other Western European currencies appeared to reflect market perceptions that the prospects for monetary tightening had ebbed in those countries in light of the persistence of subdued inflation and indications that the continuing financial turmoil in Asian and other emerging economies was likely to have a retarding effect on the economies of the industrial countries.
24,"Strength in currency and a surge in liquid deposits boosted the expansion of M2, while that of M3 was amplified by a step-up in RP borrowing to help finance more rapid growth in bank credit."
25,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested somewhat greater moderation in economic expansion than had been projected earlier and slightly less pressure on wages and prices.
26,A number of factors were expected to contribute to the slowing of aggregate demand and reduced pressure on resources.
27,"These included: a slackening in world economic expansion that, in conjunction with the appreciation of the dollar, would substantially restrain U. S. exports; some moderation of the growth in household and business investment; and a diminution in the desired rate of inventory accumulation."
28,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on indications that growth in economic activity had remained solid and that inflation had continued to be surprisingly low."
29,"While wages appeared to be increasingly subject to upward pressure, productivity had picked up in recent quarters, and the persisting strength in profits suggested that unit labor costs were not accelerating noticeably."
30,"The evidently higher pace of productivity growth was very encouraging, though it was still difficult to assess how long this favorable performance might last and the extent to which it might ease the price pressures that could emerge if the economic expansion did not moderate as members anticipated."
31,Domestic demand for goods and services had been quite strong and was likely to remain reasonably robust.
32,"The ongoing turbulence since the last Committee meeting, which included further noticeable increases in the dollar against the currencies of affected countries, likely would have a somewhat greater damping effect on output and prices in the United States than previously had been anticipated."
33,"Exports to many Asian countries, and possibly to other U. S. trading partners whose economies might be adversely affected by the spillover effects of developments in Asia, would be reduced, and declines in import prices would ease inflation pressures."
34,"With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against a wide range of currencies, along with the prospective slackening in world economic expansion associated with the Asian turmoil, could be expected to exert a considerable damping effect on U. S. exports over the next several quarters."
35,"To date, anecdotal reports indicated only scattered signs of weaker export demand, primarily some slackening in orders for and shipments of selected commodities such as agricultural goods and lumber and wood products, and there were few indications of reduced demand for manufactured goods."
36,"In the circumstances, continuing gains in wages and employment, the prevailing high levels of confidence, the cumulative effects of very large increases in household wealth in recent years, and the intense competition among retailers for the consumer's attention could promote substantial further growth in consumer expenditures."
37,"The same factors, along with the favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership, were maintaining housing demand at a relatively high level."
38,"Even so, the growth of business capital spending was expected to slow from the unusually rapid pace of recent quarters in response to the projected smaller increases in sales and profits arising from moderating economic growth."
39,Several reported that the scarcity of available workers was limiting the growth of economic activity in some parts of the country and that some employers were trying out novel approaches aimed at enticing people not currently seeking a job to enter the work force.
40,"In the course of their discussion, many members remarked on the absence of inflationary price pressures during a period when economic activity had risen briskly and labor markets had grown steadily tighter."
41,"The muted effect of higher labor compensation on unit labor costs and prices reflected sharp advances in productivity partly associated with the rapid expansion of the stock of capital; the latter had been stimulated, most probably, by the desire to enhance efficiency and thus hold down costs."
42,"More fundamentally, persistent tightness in labor markets risked a continuing uptrend in labor compensation increases that, at some point, could not be fully offset by productivity gains."
43,"Under those circumstances, competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to compensate for increases in their costs."
44,"However, for some period ahead, developments associated with the turmoil in Asia along with the partly related appreciation of the dollar would tend to intensify import competition and damp the prices of goods."
45,"In their discussion, members emphasized that price inflation had remained subdued, indeed with some key price measures indicating declining inflation, despite the persistence of robust economic growth and high levels of resource use, notably in labor markets."
46,"They expressed concern, however, that multiplying indications of faster wage increases might presage rising price inflation at some point."
47,Weighing against the risks of higher inflation was the financial turmoil that had intensified in Southeast Asia during October and more recently in Korea.
48,"The effects of those developments on the U. S. economy were quite limited thus far, but the members expected some damping of economic expansion and price increases in the quarters ahead and they did not rule out a potentially strong impact in the event of an even deeper crisis in Asia, or one that spread to other countries."
49,"Nonetheless, many members commented that, with domestic demand still quite strong and the economy possibly producing beyond its potential, they viewed the risks on balance as pointing to rising price inflation and the next policy move as likely to be in the direction of some tightening."
50,"One member, while acknowledging the downside risks to the expansion associated with potential developments in Asia, still was persuaded that the economy probably would continue to expand at an unsustainable pace and that monetary policy should be tightened promptly to avert a further buildup of pressures in already strained labor markets, associated increases in labor costs, and at some point an inevitable rise in price inflation."
51,"Current conditions in domestic financial markets clearly remained supportive of spending, but it also was noted that the real federal funds rate was relatively high and that growth in the broad measures of money was expected to moderate over coming months after a period of robust expansion."
52,The members agreed that the crosscurrents that were generating the present uncertainties in the outlook for economic activity and inflation made a flexible approach to monetary policy particularly desirable at this juncture.
53,"In their view, such a directive would continue to underscore their concern that at current and prospective levels of resource utilization, rising inflation was the most serious risk to the economy and the Committee remained committed to fostering progress toward a stable price environment that in turn would heighten the prospects for sustained economic expansion and full employment."
54,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
55,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
56,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months."
57,Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in October and November; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.
58,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened significantly in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter.
59,"Price inflation has remained subdued, despite some increase in the pace of advance in wages."
60,"Short-term interest rates have registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on November 12, 1997, while bond yields have fallen somewhat."
61,"Share prices in U. S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile."
62,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
63,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
64,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
65,"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
66,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
67,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
68,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
69,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.
70,"He recognized the case for holding policy steady given recent developments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he believed, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide valuable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain above a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later."
71,He thought further that the potential benefits of this insurance outweighed the risk that such an action would have a significant negative impact on U. S. economic activity.
72,"He also believed that signaling a greater willingness to tolerate modest policy adjustments in response to emerging developments would foster more flexible movements in longer-term financial markets, and specifically enable longer-term interest rates to play their traditional role as automatic stabilizers for the economy more effectively."
