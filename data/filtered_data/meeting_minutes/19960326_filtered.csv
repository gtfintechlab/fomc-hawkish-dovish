0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"On balance, however, growth of economic activity appeared to have picked up after having slowed appreciably in late 1995."
2,Growth in consumer spending seemed to have resumed at a moderate rate in the wake of January's storms; business spending on durable equipment was recording further healthy gains; and housing demand was showing some signs of strengthening.
3,"With businesses making considerable progress in getting their inventories under control, industrial production and employment had rebounded briskly."
4,The recent data on prices gave little indication of any change in underlying inflation trends.
5,A surge in nonfarm payroll employment in February considerably more than offset a large weather-related drop in January.
6,A small rise in manufacturing employment in February only partially offset a further loss of factory jobs in January.
7,The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.
8,Recent indicators of housing demand and activity were generally favorable.
9,Business demand for durable equipment apparently remained fairly robust in early 1996.
10,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services in December (latest data available) was little changed from its November level.
11,"On a quarterly-average basis, however, the deficit in the fourth quarter was substantially smaller than it had been in the third quarter."
12,"At the consumer level, food prices continued to edge up in February and energy prices again were under appreciable upward pressure."
13,"Excluding the often-volatile food and energy items, consumer prices advanced in February at a slightly slower rate than in January; and for the twelve months ended in February, consumer prices rose a little less than in the comparable year-earlier period."
14,"At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance over January and February; the rise in this measure of prices over the twelve months ended in February was somewhat larger than in the comparable year-earlier interval."
15,"Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
16,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
17,The decrease was made effective immediately and was passed through to interest rates in reserve markets.
18,"Over the remainder of the period, however, most interest rates moved higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting improved prospects for economic growth and, accordingly, a reduced likelihood of further easings in monetary policy."
19,"In addition, the absence of much progress in federal budget negotiations was viewed by the markets as indicating that the chances a major multiyear deficit-reduction plan would be adopted this year were becoming more remote."
20,"Despite the increase in bond yields, major indexes of equity prices recorded sizable gains."
21,The dollar fell appreciably during the initial portion of the period -- before evidence of a more robust U. S. economy emerged -- while data on German money supply and the Japanese economy were suggesting upward revisions to expected interest rates abroad.
22,Growth of the broader monetary aggregates strengthened considerably in February and early March following the decline in short-term interest rates in late 1995 and early 1996.
23,"The acceleration of M2 reflected a surge in demand deposits as well as larger inflows to retail money market mutual funds, whose yields tend to adjust with a lag to changes in short-term market interest rates."
24,Consumer spending was projected to grow slightly more than disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer concerns about job security and the effects of already high household debt burdens.
25,A less rapid pace of business investment in equipment and structures was expected in light of the decline over the past year in the rate of utilization of production capacity and the moderate growth projected for sales and profits.
26,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.
27,"Given the outlook for economic activity, rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected to change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly."
28,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the resiliency of the economy, which appeared to have strengthened appreciably after a period of subpar growth."
29,"Considerable volatility could be expected in the short-run performance of the economy, but the members continued to view trend growth at a pace near the economy's potential as the most probable outcome."
30,"Regarding the outlook for inflation, members' assessments tended to center on expectations of little change in average consumer price inflation over the projection horizon."
31,"The review of regional economic developments by the Federal Reserve Bank presidents pointed to moderate expansion in economic activity across much of the nation, though growth was described as modest in a few regions and relatively robust in some others."
32,"In agriculture, high feed costs and low market prices were depressing the cattle industry, while elevated grain prices were boosting the incomes of farmers not subject to the effects of locally adverse weather conditions."
33,"Apparently, relatively low long-term interest rates and the related substantial appreciation in the value of stock and bond market holdings had been important factors helping to sustain spending in this period."
34,"In the context of continued underlying momentum in final demand and some decline in excess stocks of unsold motor vehicles stemming from the recently ended strike at a major domestic producer, inventories now seemed to be in better balance with sales and the economy to be better positioned to accommodate sustained expansion."
35,"Some members observed, however, that the recent increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates would tend to blunt demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy."
36,"Moreover, stock market prices had risen to comparatively high levels in relation to earnings and interest rates and might be vulnerable to further weakness in the debt markets or to any tendency for business profit margins to erode."
37,"In the course of their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to recent indications, including anecdotal reports, of appreciable strengthening in retail sales that tended to support forecasts of sustained growth in consumer spending in coming quarters."
38,"On the negative side, some members observed that the rise in consumer indebtedness and the recent increase in interest rates would tend to damp consumer spending."
39,"Given these financial crosscurrents, it was suggested that growth in consumer spending might approximate that of disposable income over the forecast horizon."
40,"The prospects for business capital spending remained a sup- portive element in the outlook for further economic expansion, but growth in such spending was expected to slow considerably from its rapid pace over the past few years."
41,The ready availability and fairly low cost of business finance in equity and debt markets and the continuing commitment of business firms to modernizing their facilities to hold down costs in highly competitive markets would tend to support growth in business fixed investment.
42,"The rise in outlays for computers and related products was likely to remain fairly robust in light of the continuing advances in technology and the marked downtrend in computer prices, but the growth of computer expenditures was projected to be well below the extraordinary pace of the past few years."
43,The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.
44,"Housing activity generally was expected to be well maintained in coming quarters, though likely to moderate to some extent from current levels in lagged response to the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates."
45,"Contributing to that performance, however, might be a temporary acceleration of purchases by home buyers who anticipated further increases in mortgage interest rates."
46,"With regard to the external sector of the economy, projections of appreciable growth in exports tended to be supported by anecdotal comments of strong export demand for goods produced in various parts of the country, including some improvement in exports to Mexico."
47,"At the same time, imports might well expand somewhat more rapidly than exports if the domestic economy strengthened as projected this year from its reduced rate of growth in 1995."
48,The members did not differ greatly in their assessments of the most probable course of inflation.
49,Their expectations ranged from essentially unchanged to slightly higher inflation in comparison with 1995.
50,"At the same time, members expressed somewhat differing views about possible deviations of inflation from their expectations."
51,Those who emphasized the risks of higher-than-projected inflation tended to cite the potential for increasing wage and price pressures in an economy that already was operating at or close to its estimated capacity.
52,Increases in labor costs had been unusually subdued in light of the relatively low unemployment nationwide and widespread anecdotal reports of labor shortages.
53,"In this view the rise in labor costs could well accelerate at some point, though not necessarily in the near term, with some feedthrough to prices."
54,"Other developments that generated some concern about the outlook for inflation included the rise in the costs of medical benefits in the fourth quarter, price pressures in the energy and food sectors of the economy, and the possibility that the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates might to some extent reflect worsening inflationary expectations."
55,"Other members saw only a limited risk of higher inflation, and a few indicated that they did not rule out some reduction in consumer price inflation from that experienced in 1995."
56,In this view there was sufficient capacity in the economy to allow room for moderate growth of economic activity in line with their forecasts without fostering added inflation.
57,Some members also stressed the persistence of strong competition in numerous markets that tended to preclude or restrain raising prices.
58,"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained."
59,"The economy seemed to have adequate forward momentum and did not appear to require any further stimulus, whose implementation might contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy."
60,Several members observed that robust growth in broad money for some months suggested that monetary policy had been supportive of sustained economic expansion.
61,"At the same time, information on the economy and prices did not seem to indicate developing inflation pressures that needed to be contained by tightening policy at this juncture."
62,"Indeed, some members commented that, judged from one perspective, financial conditions had tightened somewhat as a consequence of the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, though it was difficult to disentangle the real and the inflation components of the rate increases."
63,"Nonetheless, a number of members noted that inflation was not expected to moderate further over the projection horizon and that it could move higher and the Committee would need to be particularly vigilant in guarding against such an outcome."
64,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
65,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
66,"On balance, the expansion in economic activity appears to have picked up after slowing appreciably in late 1995."
67,"Nonfarm payroll employment surged in February, considerably more than offsetting a large drop in January, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5."
68,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially in the fourth quarter from its average rate in the third quarter.
69,There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends.
70,Changes in short-term market interest rates have been mixed while long-term rates have risen appreciably since the Committee meeting on January 30-31.
71,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stabil- ity and promote sustainable growth in output.
72,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
73,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
74,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
75,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
76,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
