1,"Although employment continued to fall in manufacturing, the losses had tapered off since the first half of the year."
2,The unemployment rate fell to 5.
3,"Spending was supported by the upturn in employment, continued impetus from the recently enacted tax cuts, improved confidence, and a level of wealth that was considerably above that of earlier in the year."
4,The international trade deficit increased in September as imports of goods and services rose more than exports.
5,"Core consumer price inflation remained subdued in October, although it was up from even lower levels in the first part of the year, when it was depressed by transitory factors."
6,"Over the twelve months ending in October, core consumer prices rose only slightly and noticeably less than in the previous twelve-month period."
7,Total twelve-month consumer inflation was unchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices.
8,"Producer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually large increases in October, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the prices of motor vehicles."
9,"Twelve-month core producer price inflation, however, was on balance unchanged over the year ending October, although the twelve-month change in overall producer prices stood well above its year-earlier level owing to a jump in food and energy price inflation."
10,"By contrast, the increase in the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve months ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting a pickup in benefit costs."
11,"In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a rise in inflation from its already low level."
12,"The Committee judged that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remained the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."
13,"Upward movements in response to data releases showing an economy building momentum were offset by the market response to several statements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain accommodative and to the November employment report, which included a smaller gain in private nonfarm payrolls than market participants had expected."
14,"But the dollar depreciated, on net, over the remainder of the intermeeting period, reflecting concerns about an escalation of trade frictions prompted by the U. S. imposition of import quotas on Chinese textiles, the ability of the United States to continue to finance its current account deficit, and risks stemming from developments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey."
15,"Accommodative financial conditions, fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead."
16,"As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher, the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data were projected to continue."
17,"Even though the unemployment rate was projected to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing slack in resource utilization."
18,"And with business confidence on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had revived."
19,"While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy."
20,"Factors supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence, a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker dollar and pickup in growth abroad."
21,Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and so weigh on consumer confidence.
22,"With relatively strong economic growth nonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year."
23,"Committee members' business contacts generally expressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained, and they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment going forward."
24,"Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in the rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors and employment displayed signs of stabilizing."
25,"Some members reported an easing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal reports suggested that competition, including especially competition from foreign producers, continued to constrain pricing."
26,"In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in business spending in recent quarters would continue."
27,"Some members noted that the commercial real estate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling rents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted demand for office and retail space."
28,"With the level of inventories still quite low relative to sales and sales expected to strengthen further, a number of members noted that inventory investment could be expected to contribute to growth in aggregate demand in coming quarters."
29,"Looking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported by further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in the first half of next year."
30,"Members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases in state and local spending."
31,"Although fiscal policy more generally would probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were likely to persist."
32,"Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets and the economy."
33,"While some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster growth in the United States, domestic demand in several major trading partners appeared to be strengthening."
34,"Nonetheless, the value of U. S. imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin, and the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction added to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the U. S. economy."
35,"In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct possibility."
36,"Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which would reduce labor costs."
37,"In addition, some members noted that the current unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late, and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages."
38,"However, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small - was now regarded by most as virtually nil."
39,"Indeed, the weaker dollar, higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had not had a large effect on retail prices in the past."
40,Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum.
41,"Some noted that the rise in recent months in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields on nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in this direction."
42,"Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters."
43,The data and anecdotal evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.
44,"Nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation, wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down."
45,"In these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain subdued well into the future."
46,"To be sure, the Committee needed to remain attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted such a move."
47,"For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation, with associated costs to economic performance."
48,"In light of the recent acceleration in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had diminished appreciably."
49,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation."
50,All could agree that the risks of further disinflation were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.
51,"In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together."
52,"Views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy ""for a considerable period. """
53,A number of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances.
54,"Given the decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time."
55,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
56,The vote encompassed the following statements concerning the risks to the Committee's outlook for economic growth and inflation.
57,The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
58,The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
59,At this meeting Mr. Ferguson reported on the progress of the working group that was charged at the October 28 meeting with developing some specific proposals regarding how best to communicate the Committee's assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
60,The working group had solicited and received comments from the members of the Board of Governors and from the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks regarding potential approaches for improving communications with the public and enhancing thereby the latter's understanding of monetary policy decisions.
