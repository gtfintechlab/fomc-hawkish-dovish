0,The information reviewed at the May meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded at a below-trend pace in recent months.
1,"Gains in payroll employment had moderated, and the unemployment rate appeared to have stabilized after a period of decline."
2,"Housing construction remained under pressure from weak demand and large inventories of unsold homes, and consumer spending appeared to have slowed in recent months."
3,"Rising energy prices pushed up total PCE price inflation in March, while the twelve-month increase in core PCE prices was just slightly above its year-earlier pace."
4,The average monthly increase in payroll employment through the first four months of this year was well below the relatively strong pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.
5,"In April, the construction industry continued to shed jobs, manufacturing employment declined further, and retailers reduced hiring after a large gain in March."
6,The unemployment rate stood at 4.
7,"The household wealth-to-income ratio likely ticked down in the first quarter, as the stock market rose only a little and house prices remained soft."
8,"However, given the surge in stock prices in April, much of the lost ground had probably since been made up."
9,"All told, recent readings on home sales suggested that housing demand had weakened further."
10,"House-price appreciation continued to slow, and some measures were again showing declines in home values."
11,"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in February, reflecting a steep drop in imports, which more than offset a sizable decline in exports."
12,"Within imports, the value of oil imports plunged, reflecting decreases in both prices and quantities, and imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive parts also fell."
13,Canada's growth seemed to have rebounded from a disappointing fourth quarter.
14,"Renewed household demand in Japan pointed to further strong growth in the first quarter, while investment demand seemed to be underpinning growth in the United Kingdom."
15,Surging growth in China was a highlight of the strong performance of most countries in Asia.

17,The total PCE price index rose substantially in both February and March.
18,Core PCE prices were unchanged in March after an upswing in February.
19,"Smoothing through the high-frequency movements, the twelve-month change in the core PCE price index in March was just a touch higher than the increase over the year-earlier period."
20,Accelerations in the costs of housing and medical services were major contributors to both core CPI and core PCE inflation over the past year.
21,"Household surveys conducted in April indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation had moved up, consistent with the recent pickup in headline CPI inflation."
22,Median expectations of longer-term inflation had edged higher but were still in the narrow range seen over the past few years.
23,Recent readings on core inflation had been somewhat elevated.
24,"Although inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain those pressures."
25,The Committee's predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected.
26,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
27,"Nevertheless, the expected path for monetary policy moved lower on the announcement, as investors apparently interpreted the accompanying statement as suggesting that the Committee's economic outlook had become somewhat more balanced."
28,"However, subsequent FOMC communications--including the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, speeches by various FOMC members, and the minutes from the March meeting--were generally seen as emphasizing the Committee's concern about upside risks to inflation."
29,Measures of inflation compensation based on inflation-indexed Treasury securities were little changed despite a significant rise in oil prices.

32,"M2 accelerated during March and April, primarily reflecting faster growth in liquid deposits, which were likely boosted in April by tax-related flows."
33,"In its forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak first-quarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economy's long-run potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008."
34,"The projected gradual acceleration in economic activity largely reflected the expected waning of the drag from residential investment, although recent readings on sales and inventories of new homes had been interpreted by the staff as suggesting that the ongoing contraction in residential investment would continue for longer than previously expected."
35,"In response to data received over the past year, the staff had marked down slightly its estimate of structural productivity growth and nudged up its estimate for the increase in labor supply--leaving its estimate of the overall growth of potential GDP broadly unchanged."
36,The increases in energy and other commodity prices over the intermeeting period had led the staff to revise up its forecast for headline PCE inflation during the first half of the year.
37,"Nonetheless, the staff continued to expect core inflation to edge lower over the course of the next two years."
38,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants noted that their assessments of the medium-term prospects for economic growth and inflation had not changed materially from the previous meeting."
39,"The pace of economic expansion had slowed in the first part of this year, but the recent sub-par performance probably exaggerated the weakness of underlying demand, and the rate of economic growth was expected to pick up in coming quarters."
40,Meeting participants anticipated that real GDP would advance at a pace a little below the economy's trend rate of growth through the remainder of this year and then pick up to a rate broadly in line with the economy's trend rate in 2008.
41,"Most participants continued to expect core inflation to slow gradually, although considerable uncertainty surrounded that judgment and the Committee's predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected."
42,"In particular, the demand for new homes appeared to have weakened further in recent months, and the stock of unsold homes relative to sales had increased sharply."
43,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected."
44,"Real spending on goods had flattened out, and contacts in both the retail sector and the consumer credit sector reported a softening in the expansion of demand."
45,"Consumption was likely to be supported by continued advances in employment and incomes, as well as gains in stock prices; but the recent increases in gasoline prices probably would damp households' spending power in the near term, and the effect of the anticipated leveling out in home-price appreciation on household wealth was expected to contribute to a gradual increase in the personal saving rate over the medium run."
46,"Participants remained concerned that the housing market correction could have a more pronounced impact on consumer spending than currently expected, especially if house prices were to decline significantly."
47,"The growth of business fixed investment seemed most likely to move higher in coming quarters, supported by strong corporate balance sheets and profits, favorable financial conditions, and a gradual strengthening in business output."
48,"Participants noted that strong foreign expansion should help to underpin demand for U. S. exports, but expressed some concern that the strength of global demand could contribute to price pressures at home."
49,"Moreover, inflationary pressures in a number of overseas economies appeared to have increased of late, perhaps partly in response to heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries, and this development had the potential to add to the prices of U. S. imports."
50,"In that regard, several participants noted that the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period could reinforce the upward pressure on import prices."
51,Participants discussed how best to reconcile the slowdown in output growth over the past year with the relatively strong performance of the labor market.
52,"Aside from measurement problems, a possible explanation was that these differing trends largely related to the lagged adjustment of employment to the slowing pace of expansion."
53,"In that regard, several participants observed that the recent moderation in economic growth had been concentrated in the construction sector, but that measured employment in construction had not yet declined by a corresponding amount."
54,This suggested that increases in overall employment in coming quarters may possibly be held down by notable declines in construction employment as the adjustment of the labor force in that sector played out.
55,A slowing in employment could then occur in conjunction with a strengthening in productivity growth.
56,"Alternatively, some of the recent weakness in measured productivity growth could reflect a decline in the underlying trend in productivity and so might persist."
57,"Although this explanation might help account for some of the downshift in measured productivity growth, participants agreed that there appeared to be little other evidence pointing to a significant slowing of advances in structural productivity."
58,"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff."
59,"Unemployment continued around the low levels seen since last fall, and many business contacts reported difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified workers, especially for certain types of professional and skilled positions."
60,"Moreover, even if wages and salaries did accelerate, the resulting cost pressures might be absorbed by a narrowing in firms' profit margins from current elevated levels, rather than being passed on in the form of higher prices."
61,"All told, for most participants, the apparent tightness of the labor market remained a significant source of upside risk to inflation."
62,Nearly all participants viewed core inflation as remaining uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.
63,"Although readings on core inflation in March had been more favorable, this followed several months of elevated inflation data and price pressures were not yet viewed as convincingly on a downward trend."
64,"Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, fostered in part by stable inflation expectations and a likely deceleration in shelter costs."
65,"Some participants also expected the anticipated slight easing of pressures on resources to help nudge inflation lower, although others felt that small movements in resource utilization were unlikely to have discernible effects on inflation."
66,All participants agreed that the risks around the anticipated moderation in inflation were to the upside; and some noted that a failure of inflation to moderate could entail significant costs particularly if it led to an upward drift in inflation expectations.
67,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent."
68,Recent developments were seen as supporting the Committee's view that maintaining the current target rate was likely to foster moderate economic growth and a gradual ebbing in core inflation.
69,"Members continued to view the risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside, although with turmoil in the subprime market appearing to have remained relatively well contained and business spending indicators suggesting a more encouraging outlook, these downside risks were judged to have diminished slightly."
70,"Members agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the prospects for inflation, and the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired remained the Committee's predominant concern."
71,"In light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge that economic growth had slowed in the first part of the year."
72,"While readings on core inflation were lower in March, members felt that it was appropriate to emphasize that core inflation remained somewhat elevated."
73,"The Committee agreed that the statement should continue to note that their predominant policy concern was the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected, and that future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."
74,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
75,"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."
76,"Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
