0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"Motor vehicle production provided a sizable boost to economic activity, but other factory output changed little on net."
2,"Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend."
3,"Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation."
4,"While nonfarm payroll employment registered further small gains in July and August, the aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers declined on balance over the two-month period."
5,"A hefty increase in government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels also boosted payroll employment."
6,The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.
7,7 percent in August despite advances in claims for unemployment insurance.
8,Retail sales remained relatively brisk in August despite further decreases in stock prices and consumer confidence.
9,Residential housing activity slowed a little in July and August from the robust pace of the second quarter as further declines in mortgage rates apparently helped to support housing activity in an environment of sluggish employment and diminishing household wealth.
10,The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed appreciably in July after two quarters of large increases.
11,The smaller deficit in July reflected continued strong expansion of the value of exports coupled with a decrease in the value of imports.
12,"The very limited available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro area and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery in Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia."
13,"By contrast, Mexico experienced brisk growth in the second quarter."
14,"Despite a slight pickup in consumer price inflation in August, the increase in consumer prices (measured by either the consumer price index or the chain-indexed personal consumption expenditure index) for the year ending in August was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month period."
15,"Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably."
16,Producer prices for core finished goods likewise signaled a drop in inflation over the last year.
17,"With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers decelerated sharply over the twelve months ended in August, reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation."
18,"Market participants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating that economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than had been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while broad indexes of equity prices moved lower."
19,"Subsequently, however, a weaker tone to incoming data on production and employment, a gloomier outlook for business profits, and heightening tensions over Iraq seemed to lead investors to revise down their outlook for the economy."
20,"In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies appreciated slightly on balance over the intermeeting period as projections for growth of foreign industrial countries, particularly Germany and Japan, were marked down more than those for the United States."
21,"M2 growth remained elevated in August, though somewhat below July’s rapid pace."
22,"Much of the strength of the aggregate’s liquid components likely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity costs of holding such deposits, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity, and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices."
23,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively brisk pace late next year."
24,"The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and improving business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending."
25,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
26,"In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked up in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been mixed, raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going forward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor and capital resources."
27,"Even so, the economy appeared to be well positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment with sales, the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes."
28,"With the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the economy’s potential for some time, pressures on labor and other resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely would continue to edge lower."
29,"Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor vehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer months."
30,"The value of homes had continued to rise in most areas, and unusually low interest rates were inducing people to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend some of the embedded equity gains."
31,Increasing home equity values probably were also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending of the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market prices since the spring of 2000.
32,"Other positive factors cited as helping to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions in federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero interest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes."
33,"Looking ahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over coming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members referred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer and somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number of retailer contacts."
34,"Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment, should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions on consumer spending."
35,"In the context of sustained growth in incomes, low mortgage interest rates, by facilitating the extraction of homeowners’ equity, had played a key role in inducing a high level of spending on residential structures and home improvement expenditures."
36,"Tending to confirm currently available data on housing activity, members cited persisting anecdotal reports of robust home sales and residential construction in many regions, though indications of softening were noted in some areas and market segments, particularly in the high-price sector of the housing market."
37,Some members questioned whether generally rising housing prices and elevated levels of refinancings would persist.
38,"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening."
39,"At the same time, several positive factors in the outlook for capital spending could be cited including the greater productivity of new capital equipment, the temporary accelerated expensing tax incentives, generally strong business cash positions, and the relatively rapid depreciation of existing capital equipment."
40,"For the present, however, business contacts widely reported that because of prevailing uncertainties they were deferring major investment initiatives until they saw clear evidence of an increased need for capital to meet growing demand."
41,"Accordingly, prospective growth in final demand would have to be met through increased production."
42,"And as demand rose over the next several quarters, businesses were expected to accumulate inventories to maintain desired inventory-sales ratios, adding in the process some limited impetus to the growth of GDP."
43,"The growth of economic activity in most major foreign countries appeared to be falling below expectations earlier in the year, with adverse implications for U. S. exports."
44,"In the context of limited demand pressures on labor and other resources, current forecasts continued to point to quite low and perhaps declining inflation over the next several quarters, although there appeared to be significant crosscurrents in the outlook for prices."
45,Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.
46,"Tending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use of an extended period of economic activity below the economy’s potential as well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently declining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets."
47,"Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation."
48,"In this regard, some observed that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could imply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms."
49,"In addition, further sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate near zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy through conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy that called for negative real policy interest rates."
50,"In the view of all the members, current forecasts clearly were subject to the risk that economic growth would not be sufficient to reduce excess capacity in labor and capital markets."
51,"However, the members who favored a steady policy course noted that the recent data on household and business spending had been a bit stronger than expected and that a number of factors pointed to solid growth over time."
52,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
53,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
54,Messrs. Gramlich and McTeer dissented because they preferred to ease monetary policy at this meeting.
55,"The economic expansion, which resumed almost a year ago, had recently lost momentum, and job growth had been minimal over the past year."
56,"With inflation already low and likely to decline further in the face of economic slack and rapid productivity growth, the potential cost of additional stimulus seemed low compared with the risk of further weakness."
