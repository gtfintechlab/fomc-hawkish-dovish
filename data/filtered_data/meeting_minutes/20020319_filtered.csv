3,"Amid signs that most firms had worked down their inventories to more comfortable levels, industrial production increased slightly after having declined for nearly a year and a half, and payroll employment appeared to be bottoming out."
4,Inflation remained low despite some firming of energy prices.
5,"Private nonfarm payroll employment moved up in February, retracing part of January's drop."
6,The unemployment rate edged down again in February to 5.
7,"5 percent, and initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to drop."
8,"Business demand for motor vehicles remained mixed, with fleet sales of light vehicles higher and purchases of medium and heavy trucks somewhat weaker."

10,The available information indicated that economic activity in the foreign industrial countries showed little net change in the fourth quarter.
11,"The Canadian economy rebounded from a weak third quarter, but economic expansion in the United Kingdom nearly came to a halt in the fourth quarter, economic activity in the euro area slipped a little, and the Japanese economy recorded a steep drop."
12,"There were indications, however, of a gradually improving economic outlook in several of these economies in the first quarter as a consequence of previous monetary policy easing actions that their respective central banks had taken and from the effects of an improved economic performance in the United States."
13,Consumer price inflation picked up a bit in January as energy prices posted their first increase since September.
14,"However, on a year-over-year basis, core price inflation as measured by the consumer price index leveled out at a moderate rate, while core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price inflation declined appreciably."
15,The employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry rose moderately in the fourth quarter of last year and for the year as a whole.
16,The members noted that policy had been eased substantially over the past year and that the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate was at an unusually low level.
17,"As a result, policy was positioned to support an economic recovery as forces restraining aggregate demand abated."
18,"Nonetheless, the members agreed that there were factors that might keep the pace of expansion below the rate of growth of potential for a while, and thus the balance of risks continued to be tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
19,Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports.
20,"Expansion of M2 rebounded somewhat in February from January's lackluster rate, but growth in the early part of the year was down sharply from the robust pace of late last year."
21,Reduced demand for mortgage refinancing also seemed to have contributed to the deceleration of M2.
22,"The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have increased at a relatively slow rate in January, reflecting weak demand for business debt financing and little net borrowing by the federal government."
23,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding briskly in the early months of the year after having turned up and increased modestly in the fourth quarter.
24,"Moreover, the recently enacted federal incentive for new business equipment investment along with the outlook for continued robust gains in productivity were expected to help boost business capital spending."
25,"At the same time, still-depressed equity prices, limited growth abroad, and the dollar's strength would tend to hold down the pace of recovery."
26,"On balance, recent developments suggested that the course of final sales now had a more positive contour over the forecast horizon and that resource utilization would rise somewhat more than anticipated earlier despite higher projected growth in structural productivity."
27,"Even so, overall activity would remain below estimates of the economy's potential output for some time, and the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to keep downward pressure on core price inflation."
28,In this regard it was noted that the economy was undergoing significant structural changes and those changes were adding to the usual difficulty of projecting the trajectory of economic activity after a turning point.
29,"Unexpected strength in household expenditures, much reduced weakness in business capital spending, and substantial slowing in inventory liquidation had produced an earlier upturn in economic activity than many had anticipated."
30,A further strengthening of inventory investment would probably generate appreciable further growth in business activity over the quarters just ahead.
31,"Once the ongoing inventory correction was completed, however, it was not clear to what extent final demand in key sectors of the economy, notably business capital investment, would provide support for further economic growth."
32,"The members viewed the outlook for core price inflation as still quite benign, largely reflecting the ample availability of labor and other producer resources to accommodate rising economic activity and the favorable prospects for further robust growth in productivity."
33,"Looking ahead, inventory investment likely would turn toward accumulation as business firms facing brisk demand and depleted stocks stepped up their new orders, providing a source of significant strength in fostering economic recovery over the near term."
34,A major uncertainty in the economic outlook was the extent to which growth in final demand by households and business firms would provide ongoing support for the expansion as the impetus from inventory investment dissipated.
35,"The prospects for consumer spending remained favorable against the backdrop of a solid uptrend in disposable incomes associated to an important extent with an improving employment picture, robust underlying growth in labor productivity, and the further phase-in of personal income tax cuts enacted in 2001."
36,Members nonetheless cited some negatives in the outlook for consumer spending including the possibilities that a negative stock market wealth effect stemming from large earlier declines and the somewhat elevated rate of unemployment would weigh on consumer confidence.
37,"Moreover, energy price increases, especially if they were to become more pronounced, would tend to hold back household spending."
38,"On balance, members saw moderate further growth in consumer spending as a reasonable prospect for coming quarters."
39,"Looking ahead, the favorable factors affecting consumer spending more generally along with relatively low mortgage interest rates were expected to sustain a high level of housing expenditures this year."
40,The members generally viewed business fixed investment spending as the key to the strength of economic activity once the thrust from inventory restocking had run its course.
41,Members nonetheless cited some positives in this outlook that included the favorable effects on incentives to purchase capital equipment stemming from the outlook for relatively rapid growth in productivity and the recent passage of legislation providing a temporary tax incentive for investments in equipment and software.
42,"On balance, a substantial pickup in overall capital spending seemed likely to be delayed in the absence of surprising strength in final demand, but a wide range of possible outcomes could not be ruled out for this key sector of the economy."
43,Federal spending was increasing rapidly and its growth could taper off more slowly than current budget estimates implied.
44,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year."

46,The members expected price pressures to remain relatively contained over the next several quarters in the context of what they anticipated would be only a gradual reduction of the excess capacity in labor and product markets as the recovery progressed.
47,"Moreover, the prospects of relatively robust growth in productivity in a highly flexible and competitive economy likely would moderate the extent of any potential buildup in inflationary pressures in the future."
48,"Members nonetheless mentioned some potential negatives in this outlook, notably the possibility of rising wage pressures as labor markets became more fully employed and upward price pressures stemming from increasing steel, energy, and insurance costs."
49,"While the economy currently appeared to be expanding at a fairly vigorous pace, the advance importantly reflected a temporary swing in inventory investment and considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for final demand over the quarters ahead."
50,"Against this background, the members judged the currently accommodative stance of monetary policy to be appropriate for now, especially in light of the relatively high unemployment rate, low capacity utilization rates in numerous industries, and quiescent inflation pressures."
51,"Looking ahead, however, the stance of policy would need to be adjusted at some point to provide less stimulus as the members gained more confidence that the recovery was becoming better entrenched and the risks had shifted toward rising inflationary pressures."
52,"The need to adjust monetary policy during the early stages of a recovery presented a special challenge with regard to its timing and extent in that raising rates prematurely or too precipitately could weaken or abort the recovery, while waiting too long could risk a pickup in inflationary pressures later."
53,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
54,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future."
