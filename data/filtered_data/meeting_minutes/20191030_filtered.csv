0,"Regarding the outlook for U. S. monetary policy, the Open Market Desk's surveys and market-based indicators pointed to a high likelihood of a 25 basis point cut in the target range at the October meeting."
1,Review of Options for Repo Operations to Support Control of the Federal Funds Rate The staff briefed participants on the recent experience with using repo operations to support control of the federal funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role for repo operations in the monetary policy implementation framework over the longer run.
2,"In their comments following the staff presentation, participants emphasized the importance of maintaining reserves at a level consistent with the Committee's choice of an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation framework, in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
3,"Several of these participants also suggested that, if a standing facility were created that allowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which could make it feasible for the monetary policy implementation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be needed."
4,"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in August."
5,Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.
6,"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower pace in September than in the previous two months, but the average pace for the third quarter was similar to that for the first half of the year."
7,"However, the pace of job gains so far this year was slower than last year, even after accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020."
8,The unemployment rate moved down to a 50-year low of 3.
9,"5 percent in September, while the labor force participation rate held steady and the employment-to-population ratio moved up."
10,"The unemployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each moved lower in September, but the rate for African Americans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
11,The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-October remained near historically low levels.
12,"Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1."
13,Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.
14,"8 percent over that same 12-month period, while consumer food price inflation was well below core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined."
15,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in August.
16,The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.
17,"7 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core CPI inflation was 2."
18,"Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed, on balance, al­though the Michigan survey measure ticked down to the low end of its recent range."
19,"Key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
20,"Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over those two months and were still below the level of shipments, most measures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts' expectations of firms' longer-term profit growth declined somewhat further, and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms' investment decisions."
21,"Overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, weak GDP growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments."
22,"The nominal U. S. international trade deficit widened in August, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and a moderate pace of import growth."
23,Export growth was subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital goods.
24,"Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports fell more than exports, pointing to a narrowing of the monthly trade deficit."
25,The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that net exports made a slight negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter.
26,Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subpar in the third quarter.
27,"Similarly, GDP growth remained subdued in China and several other emerging economies in Asia, and indicators suggested that growth in Latin America also remained weak."
28,"Foreign inflation appeared to have moderated a bit in the third quarter, reflecting declines in energy prices."
29,"On net, equity prices and corporate bond spreads were little changed, and the Treasury yield curve steepened a bit."
30,Financing conditions for businesses and households remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity.
31,Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities inched down and remained near multiyear low levels.
32,"Broad stock price indexes fell by as much as 4 percent during the first half of the intermeeting period but recovered afterward, ending the period roughly unchanged."
33,"After smoothing through rate volatility over the period, interest rates for overnight unsecured and secured funding declined roughly in line with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meeting and the associated 30 basis point decrease in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate."
34,"Meanwhile, growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans at banks was modest in the third quarter as a whole."
35,"Respondents to the October 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower demand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter, while lending standards on such loans were about unchanged."
36,"The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance was strong in September, in part supported by recent declines in interest rates."
37,Banks in the October SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all types of CRE loans; they also reported weaker demand for construction lending and stronger demand for the other CRE lending categories.
38,"Interest rates on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through August."
39,"In addition, CRE prices remained high relative to rental income."
40,"Nonetheless, the staff noted that the resilience of financial institutions could be undermined by low interest rates and banks' announced plans to increase payouts to shareholders."
41,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised down a little for the second half of this year relative to the previous projection.
42,"The medium-term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged, as revisions to the staff's assumptions about factors on which the forecast was conditioned, such as financial market variables, were small and offsetting."
43,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 and 2020 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.
44,The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
45,The staff's forecast for core PCE price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data.
46,"Beyond this year, the projection for core inflation was unrevised, and the forecast for total inflation was a little lower in 2020 because of a downward revision in projected consumer energy prices."
47,"Both total inflation and core inflation were forecast to move up slightly next year, as the low inflation readings early this year were viewed as transitory; nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run somewhat below 2 percent through 2022."
48,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
49,"Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
50,"In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
51,"The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity."
52,Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
53,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
54,"On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
55,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
56,"Participants judged that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective were the most likely outcomes, and they indicated that their views on these outcomes had changed little since the September meeting."
57,"In addition, inflation pressures remained muted."
58,The risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the domestic economy remained prominent.
59,"In addition, survey measures of consumer confidence remained high, and a couple of participants commented that business contacts in consumer-facing industries reported strong demand."
60,"Many participants noted that components of household spending that are thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had improved, including purchases of consumer durables."
61,"In their discussions of the business sector, participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports and the associated restraint on domestic economic growth."
62,"Moreover, participants generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish global growth would continue to damp investment spending and exports."
63,"Manufacturing production remained weak, and continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term."
64,"A couple of participants noted that activity was particularly weak for the energy industry, in part because of low petroleum prices."
65,"In addition, a few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with lower crop yields, tariffs, weak export demand, and difficult financial positions for many farmers."
66,One bright spot for the agricultural sector was that some commodity prices had firmed recently.
67,"Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains, on average."
68,"However, the pace of increases in employment had slowed some, on net, in recent months."
69,"On the one hand, the slowing could be interpreted as a natural consequence of the economy being near full employment."
70,"On the other hand, slowing job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in labor demand, which may be consistent with an observed decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other measures of labor market tightness."
71,Several participants commented that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year.
72,"Consistent with strong national data on the labor market, business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
73,"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, had continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
74,"While survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were generally little changed, some measures of households' inflation expectations had moved down to historically low levels."
75,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, with some longer-term measures being at or near multi-year lows."
76,"Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the downside, and a few participants commented that they expected inflation to run below 2 percent for some time."
77,"Some other participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year would be transitory, or that some recent monthly readings seemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent."
78,A couple of participants noted that some measures of inflation could temporarily move above 2 percent early next year because of the transitory effects of tariffs.
79,"Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, which remained tilted to the downside."
80,"In particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending remained prominent."
81,"In their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate."
82,"In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants continued to point to global developments weighing on the economic outlook, the need to provide insurance against potential downside risks to the economic outlook, and the importance of returning inflation to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis."
83,Many participants judged that an additional modest easing at this meeting was appropriate in light of persistent weakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty regarding trade developments.
84,"Nonetheless, these participants noted that incoming data had continued to suggest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of continued headwinds from global developments and that previous adjustments to monetary policy would continue to help sustain economic growth."
85,"In addition, several participants suggested that a modest easing of policy at this meeting would likely better align the target range for the federal funds rate with a variety of indicators used to assess the appropriate policy stance, including estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of the yield curve."
86,"In particular, risks to the outlook associated with global economic growth and international trade were still seen as significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and trade-related developments over the intermeeting period."
87,Many participants also cited the level of inflation or inflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.
88,"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective, and inflationary pressures remained muted."
89,Several participants raised concerns that measures of inflation expectations remained low and could decline further without a more accommodative policy stance.
90,"A couple of these participants, pointing to experiences in Japan and the euro area, were concerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a decline in longer-run inflation expectations and less room to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a future recession."
91,"In general, the participants who justified further easing at this meeting based on considerations related to inflation viewed this action as helping to move inflation up to the Committee's 2 percent objective on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expectations at levels consistent with that objective."
92,"These participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy remained favorable, with inflation expected to move up and stay near the Committee's 2 percent objective."
93,"They also judged that policy accommodation was already adequate and, in light of lags in the transmission of monetary policy, preferred to take some time to assess the economic effects of the Committee's previous policy actions before easing policy further."
94,A few participants raised the concern that a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting could encourage excessive risk-taking and exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector.
95,"With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, most participants judged that the stance of policy, after a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective and likely would remain so as long as incoming information about the economy did not result in a material reassessment of the economic outlook."
96,A couple of participants expressed the view that the Committee should reinforce its postmeeting statement with additional communications indicating that another reduction in the federal funds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming information was consistent with a significant slowdown in the pace of economic activity.
97,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the September meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
98,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
99,"However, business fixed investment and exports remained weak, as softness in global growth and international trade developments continued to weigh on those sectors."
100,"On a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
101,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
102,Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
103,"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, most members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent at this meeting."
104,"The members who supported this action viewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade developments, insuring against downside risks arising from those sources, and promoting a more rapid return of inflation to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
105,"These members indicated that the economic outlook remained positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee's 2 percent objective."
106,"Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
107,"They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
108,"In describing the monetary policy outlook, they also agreed to remove the ""act as appropriate"" language and emphasize that the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assessed the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
109,This change was seen as consistent with the view that the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long as the economy performed broadly in line with the Committee's expectations and that policy was not on a preset course and could change if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the economic outlook.
110,"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
111,"Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
112,"On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."
113,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
114,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
115,"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent."
116,"This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain."
117,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
118,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
119,President George dissented at this meeting because she believed that an unchanged setting of monetary policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
120,President Rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already accommodative and that additional accommodation was not needed for an economy in which labor markets are very tight.
121,He judged that providing additional accommodation posed risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage.
122,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1."
