0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"Business inventory accumulation had been quite modest, and production and employment were expanding less rapidly."
2,"Increases in labor compensation had been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, had remained on a fairly steady trend."
3,"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased relatively rapidly in July, though at a considerably slower pace than in the second quarter."
4,"Job growth in the services industry slowed sharply, and manufacturing employment declined appreciably after having risen somewhat in the second quarter."
5,"In contrast, the expansion in employment in wholesale and retail trade picked up slightly in July, and the number of jobs in construction continued to increase at about the second-quarter pace."
6,"The average workweek for private production or nonsupervisory workers fell considerably in July, to a level a little below its average for the second quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5."
7,Retail sales weakened somewhat over June and July following several months of robust growth.
8,"The drop in housing starts, coupled with lower sales of new and existing homes in June (latest data available), suggested that the rise in mortgage rates was exerting a damping effect on housing demand and homebuilding activity."
9,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed in June, but on a quarterly average basis the deficit widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter."
10,"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter."
11,"Price inflation remained moderate on balance in June and July, with declines in energy prices essentially offsetting increases in food prices."
12,"Over a somewhat longer horizon, consumer prices for nonfood, non-energy items increased slightly less in the twelve months ended in July than in the previous twelve-month period."
13,Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy also increased more slowly in the twelve months ended in July.
14,"In contrast, growth in labor costs had picked up."
15,The employment cost index for private industry workers advanced at a somewhat faster rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter or in the second half of 1995.
16,"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
17,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
18,"With economic growth moderating and inflation quiescent, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period."
19,"The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August."
20,"On balance, most other short-term market interest rates declined slightly, and intermediate- and long-term rates fell somewhat more, over the intermeeting period."
21,"In the days immediately following the meeting, rates rose sharply in response to incoming data, notably the employment report for June that market participants viewed as indicating increasing pressures on economic resources and labor costs."
22,"Equity prices also exhibited considerable volatility over the period since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, with major indexes of stock prices falling steeply through late July before recouping part to most of their losses in association with the bond market rally and favorable earnings reports."
23,The flow of information suggesting a slowing in U. S. economic growth and reduced prospects for a near-term tightening of Federal Reserve policy weighed against the dollar.
24,"Much of the slowdown in the expansion of M2 was associated with an unexpected decline in demand deposits, which had grown rapidly earlier in the year."
25,"With bank credit expanding sluggishly, the funding needs of banks were modest, and the slower growth of M2 showed through to M3."
26,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential."
27,Consumer spending was projected to expand at a more moderate pace that would be in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect of the earlier run-up in equity prices on household wealth and the generally ample availability of credit were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens.
28,Homebuilding was forecast to slow somewhat in response to the backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
29,Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits.
30,"On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period."
31,"Inflation recently had been lifted by adverse developments in energy markets and was projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the high level of resource utilization, the effects of tight grain supplies on food prices, and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation reinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage."
32,"[Return to top] In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that on balance the information received since the July meeting, including anecdotal reports from around the nation, pointed to some slowing in the growth of economic activity from a very rapid pace during the spring."
33,"Nonetheless, broad measures of price inflation, adjusted to exclude their volatile food and energy components, did not exhibit any uptrend despite robust growth in economic activity this year and high levels of resource use."
34,"Indeed, some price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through the second quarter."
35,"In labor markets, however, there were increasing indications of tightness that might at some point feed through to greater inflation."
36,"Although increases in compensation might be moderated by greater productivity or absorbed for a time by lower profit margins, the risks seemed tilted toward increases in inflation at some point, especially if the growth of the economy continued to outstrip its potential and added to pressures on resources."
37,"In the course of the Committee's discussion, members cited a variety of indications that economic growth was slowing from a very rapid pace, and they pointed to a number of factors that in their view should promote continued, though more moderate, expansion in economic activity."
38,"It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy."
39,"Should the expansion in final demand fail to moderate to a sustainable pace, business firms would be likely to intensify their efforts to build their inventories, which currently were widely viewed as satisfactory or even relatively lean in relation to sales."
40,"Accordingly, aggressive inventory accumulation remained an upside risk to the projected expansion but not one that was likely to materialize unless final demand were to exceed current forecasts by a significant margin."
41,"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained remarkably subdued for an extended period in relation to measures of resource utilization, notably the rate of unemployment."
42,One factor tending to hold down prices has been highly competitive markets--throughout the nation and internationally as well--that made it very difficult for business firms to raise prices.
43,"Another key factor, though one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the persistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation, which remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels of unemployment."
44,"In assessing whether a relatively favorable inflation performance was likely to continue, the members focused on a variety of issues."
45,Another was whether a rate of unemployment in the vicinity of its current level would foster added wage pressures.
46,"Uncertainty also surrounded the extent to which further increases in labor compensation costs, should they materialize, would be passed through to higher prices."
47,"Improvements in productivity were likely to offset part of such increases, but how much remained an open question."
48,"With regard to the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too early to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases this year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with historical experience under essentially full employment conditions."
49,"On balance, the inflation risks in the outlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for more inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented by a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices and perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters."
50,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way."
51,"A number also commented that real interest rates were not unusually low, suggesting that any pickup in inflationary pressures, should that occur, would be modest and readily contained."
52,Such a development could have serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the expansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace.
53,"At the same time, it was emphasized that the Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise in inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of greater price pressures and before they showed through to actual inflation."
54,Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.
55,"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation."
56,A differing view gave more weight to the risks of rising inflation.
57,"In this view, while there were uncertainties, the weight of the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to contain inflation and set the stage for further progress toward price stability."
58,"More importantly, a prompt action would reduce the risk that inflation would worsen and pose difficult problems for monetary policy later."
59,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
60,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
61,"[Return to top] At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity recently has moderated somewhat."
62,"Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly in July, the average workweek fell sharply, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5."
63,Real consumer spending weakened somewhat on balance over June and July following several months of robust growth.
64,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter.
65,"Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, has remained on a fairly steady trend."
66,"Most short-term market interest rates have declined slightly while intermediate- and long-term rates have fallen somewhat more since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, 1996."
67,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
68,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
69,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
70,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
71,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
72,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
73,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
74,"He was concerned that, in the absence of a substantial and sustained improvement in productivity, the prevailing pattern of demand might engender an increase in inflationary pressures, and that such pressures would ultimately threaten the ongoing economic expansion."
