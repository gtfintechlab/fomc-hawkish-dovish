0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.
2,"Consumer spending had rebounded from its summer lull, but housing demand was somewhat weaker on balance and the growth of business spending on durable equipment had slowed from a very rapid pace."
3,Both industrial production and employment had recorded sizable advances.
4,"Increases in labor compensation had trended up this year, and consumer price inflation also had picked up, but the faster rise in overall consumer prices owed entirely to larger increases in food and energy prices."
5,Private-sector demand for labor remained solid in November.
6,"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November after an October surge, and the average workweek of private production or nonsupervisory workers retraced more than half of its October decline."
7,"Service industries recorded another large gain in employment despite a sharp drop in payrolls at help-supply firms, and the number of jobs in retail trade expanded further in November after a steep rise in October."
8,"In the goods-producing sector, employment in construction and manufacturing rose moderately."
9,"The civilian unemployment rate increased slightly, to 5."
10,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services was somewhat larger in September than in August; exports decreased slightly in September while imports were little changed.
11,"For the third quarter, the deficit widened substantially from its rate in the second quarter as exports fell and imports rose moderately."
12,"Economic growth picked up in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter, but available indicators generally suggested some slowing of growth in the fourth quarter."
13,"In Japan, by contrast, economic activity had been sluggish in the third quarter but appeared to have picked up more recently."
14,"Consumer price inflation in October and November was lifted slightly by sizable advances in energy prices and, to a lesser degree, increases in food prices; however, consumer prices for items other than food and energy rose modestly during the two months."
15,"The rise in core consumer prices over the twelve months ended in November was somewhat smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months, although the total index registered a bigger advance as a result of larger increases in food and energy prices."
16,"At the producer level, prices of finished energy goods rose sharply in October and November while prices of finished foods advanced less rapidly."
17,"Excluding food and energy, prices of finished goods edged lower on balance over October and November, and in the twelve months ended in November, these prices rose substantially less than in the previous twelve months."
18,"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
19,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and relatively strong expansion of M3 over coming months.
20,"Other short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the November 13 meeting; Treasury bill rates drifted lower, partly because of heightened demands for safety and liquidity as asset markets became more volatile during the period, while year-end pressures boosted rates on private instruments with maturities in early 1997."
21,"At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued, but they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices."
22,"Despite these concerns, most major indexes of equity prices advanced further on balance."
23,"Growth of M2 picked up, reflecting a sharp increase in demand deposits and smaller runoffs in other checkable deposits."
24,Expansion of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October as growth in business demands for credit slowed and banks reduced their reliance on large time deposits and other managed liability components.
25,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's estimated growth potential.
26,"Consumer spending was projected to increase at a rate generally in line with the anticipated rise in disposable income; the favorable effects on household wealth of the advance that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance the damping effects of continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings, the security of their jobs, and the extent of their debt burdens."
27,Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
28,Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits.
29,Fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to continue to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the projection period.
30,"Consumer price inflation, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the price index, was forecast to rise slightly over 1997 and 1998 in the context of anticipated high resource use and an accompanying appreciable pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would be augmented by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage."
31,Somewhat larger increases would have been projected in consumer price inflation in the absence of anticipated technical measurement changes to the index.
32,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented that the information received during the relatively short interval since the previous meeting had not materially altered either their assessment that the economy was performing quite favorably or their forecasts of further growth at a pace averaging near the economy's potential."
33,"Against the background of generally supportive financial conditions and a high degree of consumer and business confidence, further economic growth was thought likely to be sustained by appreciable increases in consumer spending and business investment."
34,"Despite the prospects for moderate economic growth, members observed that the risks on inflation still seemed to be tilted toward some rise over time."
35,Measures of core inflation had displayed little trend and even some decline over the past year.
36,"At some point accelerating labor compensation costs, were they to continue, likely would spill over into higher inflation."
37,"Such an outcome remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty, however, in light of the relatively benign behavior in recent years of both wages and prices in comparison with historical experience at prevailing levels of resource utilization."
38,"Members cited a number of factors--the rise in consumer debt burdens, tightening consumer credit standards, continued worker concerns about job security, and the satisfaction of earlier pent-up demands--that were tending to inhibit the growth in consumer spending and perhaps helped to explain why the sharp increases in stock market wealth had not been accompanied by stronger growth in such spending."
39,"In these circumstances, the members recognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in the stock market and asset markets more generally for their implications for consumer and other spending."
40,"On balance, favorable employment and income conditions seemed likely to foster a level of consumer spending that would provide key support for sustained economic expansion."
41,"Slowing growth in profit levels and cash flows was likely to retard spending for many types of business equipment, but favorable prices, advancing technology, and readily available financing probably would continue to foster rapid expansion in office, computing, and communications equipment."
42,"Weakness in late summer and early fall evidently reflected the effects of earlier increases in mortgage interest rates, but some measures of housing activity in November indicated unexpected strength."
43,"In this view, a level of housing construction somewhat below the peak reached earlier in 1996 was likely to be sustained, buoyed in part by the recent decline in mortgage interest rates and the continuing rise in consumer incomes and favorable consumer sentiment."
44,"Such an agreement would need to include controversial constraints on the growth of entitlements, but its achievement would have favorable effects on financial markets and on business and consumer sentiment more generally, thereby tending to offset at least in part any direct effects of reduced federal spending on aggregate demand."
45,"Members anticipated that the external sector of the economy would continue to exert some restraint on domestic economic activity, though perhaps to a lesser extent than over the past year."
46,"In particular, the growth of U. S. exports was expected to accelerate somewhat in association with some strengthening on average in the economies of the nation's key trading partners."
47,"Labor compensation costs clearly were rising at a faster pace in the context of persistently tight labor markets, and an upturn in core price inflation seemed quite possible at some point in the absence of some easing of pressures in labor markets."
48,"However, the members recognized that the increase in wage inflation had been significantly less than would have been anticipated on the basis of historical relationships with labor market conditions, and price performance also had been more favorable than those relationships would have suggested."
49,"In the circumstances, there was a good deal of uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation, including the potential degree of utilization in labor markets, the associated pressures on labor costs, and the ability of firms to pass higher labor costs into prices in markets that generally continued to be described as highly competitive."
50,"With the economy operating in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential, relatively minor differences in overall economic growth could have a significant effect over time on whether inflation would tend to trend up or down."
51,An unchanged policy was warranted by the quite satisfactory performance of the economy and inflation and the uncertainties surrounding the outlook.
52,"Thus, while the longer-term risks might point toward rising inflation, there were reasonable prospects that inflation would remain contained, and any pickup in inflation, should it occur, was likely to be limited at least for a time."
53,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation."
54,"In this connection, some members emphasized that it would be especially important for the Committee to act promptly to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally."
55,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
56,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace."
57,"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November, although the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5."
58,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter.
59,"Increases in labor compensation have trended up this year, and consumer price inflation also has picked up owing to larger increases in food and energy prices."
60,"Short-term market interest rates have registered mixed changes since the Committee meeting on November 13, 1996, while long-term yields have risen slightly."
61,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
62,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
63,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
64,"For 1997, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
65,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
66,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
