0,The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to decelerate in recent months.
1,"Consumer and business spending held up well, and payroll employment continued to rise moderately in July and August."
2,Core consumer price inflation eased somewhat but nonetheless remained higher than it was in 2005.
3,"Total consumer price inflation moderated in August, reflecting a substantial slowing of the increase in energy prices."
4,"However, employment in retail trade and manufacturing fell again in August."
5,The unemployment rate ticked back down to 4.
6,"Despite the sharp net increase in energy prices, real disposable income rose further, with solid gains in June and July."
7,"However, consumer borrowing costs had risen since the beginning of the year with the increase in short-term interest rates."
8,Available measures suggested that prices of existing homes increased through the second quarter at a much lower rate than the one observed during the same period last year.
9,"After strong increases in the first half of 2006, real spending on equipment and software remained robust into the summer against a backdrop of rising business output, plentiful corporate cash reserves, positive sentiment among executives, and falling relative prices for high-tech equipment."
10,"Outside the motor vehicle sector, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and surveys indicated that firms continued to be generally comfortable with their level of inventories."
11,"Both imports and exports increased in the second quarter, but imports increased and exports decreased in July, widening the U. S. trade deficit."
12,"The growth of imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting higher petroleum prices, and in non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods."
13,"A fall in net exports held back expansion in Japan and Canada, while strong domestic demand boosted growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area."
14,Incoming data suggested that overall GDP growth in these countries for the current quarter was dropping a bit from the second-quarter pace.
15,"Recent economic indicators from the emerging-market economies generally pointed to robust, but moderating, growth."
16,"The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures rose relatively steeply in July and was estimated to have increased further in August, bringing the advance over the twelve-month period above the year-earlier rise."
17,"After July, though, crude oil and gasoline prices dropped back significantly, and with inventories of natural gas remaining near seasonal highs, natural gas prices fell from their spike earlier this summer."
18,"Core consumer prices increased at a somewhat more subdued pace over July and August, but despite the recent moderation, the twelve-month change in core prices remained above the increase over the comparable period twelve months earlier."
19,The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose significantly in July and August.
20,"After more favorable readings in June and July, survey measures of households' inflation expectations turned back up in August, but preliminary September readings suggested a decline."
21,"The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had moderated from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."
22,"Readings on core inflation had been elevated in recent months, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
23,"However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions, as well as reduced impetus from higher energy and materials costs."
24,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained."
25,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
26,"Subsequently, data on inflation that were weaker than expected, substantial declines in oil prices, and the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting led investors to revise down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate."
27,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons."
28,"Nominal forward rates further out the yield curve fell about the same amount as real forward rates, implying little change in far-forward inflation compensation."
29,Major stock price indexes posted solid gains.
30,"M2 growth remained modest in August, consistent with moderating growth of nominal income and lagged increases in opportunity cost."
31,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real GDP growth would continue to slow into the second half of 2006 before strengthening gradually thereafter.
32,"By 2008, output was projected to be expanding at a pace about equal to the staff's forecast of potential output growth."
33,"The staff, however, had again reduced its projection for potential GDP growth, and the projected slow pace of growth over the next several quarters was thus consistent with an opening of only a small gap in resource utilization."
34,"In the near term, the cooling of the housing market and lower motor vehicle production were expected to hold growth back."
35,"At the same time, though, significantly lower energy prices, sustained increases in labor income, and favorable labor market conditions were anticipated to support expansion through the end of the year."
36,"Further ahead, the lagged effects of the previous tightening of monetary policy and waning stimulus from household wealth and fiscal policy were anticipated to restrain growth, but the drag from the downturn in residential construction was expected to abate."
37,"Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next, reflecting the emergence of slack in the economy and lower energy costs."
38,"In particular, activity in the housing market seemed to be cooling considerably, which would contribute to relatively subdued growth over the balance of the year."
39,"Growth was likely to strengthen next year as the housing correction abated, with activity also encouraged by the recent decline in energy prices and still-supportive financial conditions."
40,"In the view of many participants, economic expansion would probably track close to the rate of growth of the economy's potential next year and in 2008."
41,Many participants also noted that core inflation had been running at an undesirably high rate.
42,"Although most participants expected core inflation to decline gradually, substantial uncertainty attended this outlook."
43,"Available measures of home prices suggested that appreciation had slowed considerably but prices in most areas were not falling, although some sellers were reported to be providing various inducements to potential purchasers that reduced effective prices."
44,"Indeed, consumer expenditures appeared to have been expanding moderately over the previous few months, buoyed by increases in employment, personal income, and household wealth."
45,"Meeting participants noted that consumer spending going forward would be supported by the higher levels of personal income indicated by recent revisions to the national income and product accounts, by further gains in employment, and by the decline in consumer energy prices over recent months."
46,"However, considerable uncertainty was expressed regarding the ultimate extent of the downturn in the housing sector and the degree to which the slowing in housing activity and the deceleration in home prices would affect consumption and other expenditures going forward."
47,"Although some survey evidence suggested that some firms were trimming capital spending plans, participants reported that their business contacts generally were quite positive about the economic outlook and the strength of demand for their products."
48,"Foreign economic growth was expected to continue, albeit perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than expected by some outside forecasters, contributing to increases in U. S. exports."
49,"Nonetheless, some participants viewed the recent increase in overall compensation as pointing to upside risks to inflation."
50,"Participants reported steady gains in employment in various regions, roughly in line with expansion of the labor force."
51,"One participant highlighted that, in the staff forecast, labor force growth would begin to slow over the next few years as more members of the baby-boom generation retired."
52,"Even if resource utilization rates were unchanged, slower growth of the labor force would mean that increases in employment would be significantly lower, on average, than those registered in recent years."
53,"In that case, the slower growth of the labor force and employment implied that the expansion of potential GDP could be somewhat lower than it had been earlier this decade."
54,"Some participants commented, however, that they viewed potential output growth, as well as expansion of actual output, as likely to remain solid over the next several years."
55,Many meeting participants emphasized that they continued to be quite concerned about the outlook for inflation.
56,"Recent rates of core inflation, if they persisted, were seen as higher than consistent with price stability, and participants underscored the importance of ensuring a moderation in inflation."
57,"To be sure, very recent data on inflation suggested some improvement from the situation in the late spring, partly reflecting slower increases in owners' equivalent rent."
58,"Also, the considerably lower level of energy prices of recent weeks, if sustained, would help reduce overall inflation and damp increases in core prices."
59,"However, energy prices remained quite sensitive to a wide range of forces, including geopolitical developments, and might well rebound."
60,"To date, the available evidence indicated that inflation expectations remained contained--indeed, expectations of price increases for the next few years had fallen some as energy prices declined."
61,"Nonetheless, several participants worried that inflation expectations could rise and the Federal Reserve's willingness to carry through on its intention to seek price stability could be called into question if cost and price pressures mounted or even if there was no moderation in core inflation."
62,"Looking forward, most participants thought that the most likely outcome was a reduction in inflation pressures, but the anticipated decline was only gradual and the uncertainties around that forecast were skewed toward higher rather than lower inflation rates."
63,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting."
64,Members generally expected economic activity to expand at a pace below the rate of growth of potential output in the near term before strengthening some over time.
65,"Although the uncertainties were substantial, core inflation seemed most likely to ebb gradually from its elevated level, in part owing to the waning effects of past increases in energy prices."
66,The anticipated expansion of economic activity at a pace slightly below the rate of growth of the economy's potential would likely also play a role by easing pressures on resources.
67,"Members noted that certain developments of late--appreciable declines in energy prices, some softer indicators of economic activity, and slightly lower readings on core inflation--pointed to a modestly better inflation outlook and hence made the policy decision today somewhat less difficult than it was in August, when it was seen as a particularly close call."
68,"In view of the most recent information on the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate for the post-meeting statement to characterize economic growth as apparently continuing to moderate."
69,"However, in view of still-high energy and other commodity prices and elevated rates of resource utilization as well as recent indications of a possible acceleration in labor costs, members continued to see a substantial risk that inflation would not decline as anticipated by the Committee."
70,"Consequently, the Committee agreed that the statement should again cite such risks to inflation and explicitly reference the possibility of additional policy firming."
71,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
72,"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain."
73,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
74,Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged.
75,Recent data indicated that inflation remained above levels consistent with price stability.
76,"Moreover, the upswing in compensation and unit labor costs in the first half of the year indicated that inflation risks were tilted to the upside."
77,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down."
