0,"0 "" 12/28/96 Return to top The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited information available for the period since then indicated continued moderate expansion."
2,"A marked softening in the growth of consumer expenditures accounted for much of the slowing in the third quarter, but slight weakening in housing demand, net exports, and federal purchases of goods and services also exerted retarding effects."
3,"On the other hand, a sizable increase in inventory investment, greater strength in business demand for durable equipment, and an upturn in spending on nonresidential construction helped foster moderate further economic growth in the third quarter."
4,Consumer price inflation had picked up this year because of larger increases in food and energy prices.
5,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in October after a small rise in September; private payroll growth had moderated on balance since midyear but nevertheless had remained substantial.
6,"In October, job gains were large in services industries; construction employment registered another moderate gain; and manufacturing payrolls edged up after a sizable September loss."
7,The civilian unemployment rate in October was unchanged at 5.
8,"Sales of computers and communications equipment increased rapidly, but demand for other capital goods was up only slightly during the quarter."
9,"Spending on nonresidential structures more than reversed a second- quarter decline; however, incoming data on contracts pointed to a continuation of the pattern of somewhat slower growth recorded thus far in 1996."
10,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter."
11,"The limited available information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter."
12,Consumer price inflation had picked up on balance this year as a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices.
13,"Over August and September, however, increases in food prices were offset by a net decline in energy prices, and overall consumer prices rose more moderately."
14,"For the twelve months ended in September, the advance in consumer prices of items other than food and energy was a little smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months."
15,"At the producer level, price inflation also was moderate over August and September despite appreciable increases in the prices of food and energy items; producer prices of items other than food and energy rose considerably less over the twelve months ended in September than they had over the previous twelve months."
16,"Growth in the employment cost index for private industry workers slowed considerably in the third quarter after having trended up over the first two quarters of the year; however, this measure of labor compensation was up slightly over the twelve months ended in September compared with the previous twelve months."
17,"The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
18,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
19,"With incoming information continuing to suggest moderate economic growth and subdued price inflation, open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged policy stance."
20,"Market participants had anticipated some tightening of monetary policy at the September 24 meeting, and the announcement of an unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates, with the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield curve."
21,"Interest rates, especially those at intermediate and longer maturities, dropped further over the remainder of the period in response to information indicating that price and labor cost pressures were lower than market participants had expected."
22,"Equity markets responded to the declines in interest rates as well as to favorable earnings reports, and most major indexes reached record highs."
23,Interest rates in the foreign industrial countries fell somewhat less on average than did U. S. interest rates.
24,"By contrast, M3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in September and October than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its large time deposit and other managed liability components to meet business demand for bank loans."
25,"Return to top The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would continue at a rate close to, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential."
26,Consumer spending was projected to rebound in the current quarter and subsequently to expand at a moderate pace in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect on household wealth of the rise that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens.
27,Homebuilding was forecast to decline slightly further in response to the previous backup in residential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
28,Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits.
29,"On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period."
30,"Continued pressure on resources, especially in labor markets, pointed to a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the projection period; however, it was expected that improved supply conditions in food and energy markets, as well as planned technical changes, would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to the elevated 1996 rate."
31,"In the Committee's discussion, members commented that most recent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation had been favorable."
32,The information on economic activity since the September meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economy's potential.
33,"In this regard, several focused on what they saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of consumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter; the pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer term despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation."
34,"With respect to the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, the increase in wages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated, and there was no broad evidence of rising price inflation."
35,"Indeed, many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993."
36,"Looking ahead, views differed to some extent regarding the most likely course for inflation."
37,"Several members indicated that, while recent developments were encouraging, they continued to see the risks as tilted toward some rise, even assuming that the expansion settled into a pattern of growth near the economy's potential as they anticipated and resource utilization remained near current levels; other members felt that the risks surrounding the forecasts for both economic growth and price inflation had become more evenly balanced, but more evidence was needed before a firm judgment could be reached."
38,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members said that they anticipated a pickup in consumer spending from its much reduced rate of growth in the third quarter."
39,These included persisting growth in employment and incomes and clearly upbeat consumer sentiment as evidenced by recent surveys and anecdotal reports.
40,"Financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households."
41,"Among the developments that would tend to limit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of consumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many households."
42,"The growth of consumer credit was now exhibiting a moderating trend, possibly pointing to restrained spending by many households because of already heavy debt service burdens and generally tightening credit standards for consumer loans."
43,Other negative factors cited in the outlook for consumer expenditures were the possibility of a correction in the stock market and the probable satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables.
44,"In balancing these conflicting influences, the members generally concluded that a pickup in the growth of consumer spending to a moderate pace was a likely prospect for this critical sector of the economy."
45,This view took account of the continued availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms but also of expectations of a more moderate growth trend in sales and the substantial buildup that had already occurred in stocks of equipment and structures.
46,"Nonetheless, members reported considerable nonresidential building activity in several parts of the country, and nationwide such activity was expected to help sustain modest growth in overall nonresidential construction in coming quarters."
47,"Recent data, supported by anecdotal reports from several though not all parts of the country, suggested that residential building activity was slowing somewhat, apparently in lagged response to earlier increases in mortgage interest rates."
48,"However, in the context of the partial reversal recently of the previous increases in mortgage rates and sustained growth in employment and incomes, the housing sector was viewed as likely to exert only a minor constraint on overall economic activity over the forecast horizon."
49,Another somewhat negative factor in the outlook for economic activity was the prospect of some widening in the nation's trade deficit over the projection period.
50,"The growth of nonfarm business inventories in the third quarter had exceeded earlier expectations, but members commented that the sizable rise appeared to have been largely voluntary and the overall level of inventories was still historically low in relation to sales."
51,"Beyond the near term, inventory investment was expected to become a more neutral factor in the performance of the economy, given the absence of incentives to build stocks relative to sales in a period of moderate growth in projected demand."
52,"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices."
53,"Moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations."
54,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets."
55,"Indeed, with the notable exception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation as measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease marginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years."
56,"Despite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation and prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher inflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect."
57,A related concern was whether the tightness in labor markets would ease sufficiently and quickly enough to prevent inflation pressures from escalating significantly.
58,"Some members mentioned a number of favorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to attenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a result of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions in markets for energy."
59,Relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures.
60,"Moreover, the view was advanced that recent developments in bond markets could be read as suggesting some decrease in inflationary expectations."
61,"On balance, while the members expressed varying degrees of concern that tight labor markets and attendant increases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation, they agreed that there was little or no evidence of such a development at this point and the outlook was far from certain."
62,The slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace near the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening price pressures and provided the Committee with a desirable opportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the course of economic activity and inflation.
63,"Indeed, to the extent that inflation expectations had declined recently, short-term interest rates, which had changed little in nominal terms, had edged higher in real terms, implying slightly greater monetary restraint and reducing the odds that inflation would pick up."
64,"Several viewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that the risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising inflation over time."
65,Other members commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be viewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary pressures.
66,"They agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature in the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately, that the Federal Reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a a modest upward trajectory in price inflation."
67,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
68,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and relatively strong expansion in M3 over coming months.
69,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited available information indicates continued moderate expansion more recently."
70,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.
71,The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.
72,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened considerably in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter.
73,"Increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, have trended up this year; consumer price inflation also has picked up this year, owing to larger increases in food and energy prices."
74,"Market interest rates have moved lower since the Committee meeting on September 24, 1996, with the largest declines occurring in intermediate- and long-term maturities."
75,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
76,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
77,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
78,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
79,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
80,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
81,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and relatively strong expansion in M3 over coming months.
