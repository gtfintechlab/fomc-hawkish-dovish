0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed after having surged in late 1996 and earlier this year.
2,"Consumer spending appeared to be increasing at a considerably slower pace after the spurt in the first quarter, while business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend, and the demand for housing seemed to be well maintained."
3,"Growth of labor demand had moderated somewhat from the rapid pace at the beginning of the year, but labor markets remained tight and worker compensation appeared to be accelerating gradually."
4,"Despite the upward drift in labor costs, underlying price inflation was still subdued."
5,"Private nonfarm payroll employment rose at a considerably reduced pace over March and April, and the average workweek dropped from an unusually high rate in February and March to a more normal level in April."
6,"The services industries recorded further large gains in employment in March and April, but the number of jobs in manufacturing contracted in April and construction employment declined in both March and April."
7,The civilian unemployment rate fell appreciably in April to 4.
8,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on balance over January and February from the temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter of last year and was about the same as the rate in the third quarter.
9,"Recent economic information on the foreign G-7 countries, including some preliminary indicators for the second quarter, suggested that the growth of output had strengthened somewhat on average in these countries."
10,Recent data indicated that price inflation remained moderate despite a gradual acceleration of labor costs.
11,Increases in consumer prices were held down in March and April by sizable declines in energy prices and a small net reduction in food prices.
12,"Consumer prices for items other than food and energy advanced at a moderate rate over the two months, and over the twelve months ended in April they increased by the same amount as in the previous twelve months."
13,"Producer prices fell in both March and April, reflecting large declines in energy prices."
14,"Excluding food and energy, producer prices edged lower in April after rising a sizable amount in March."
15,Core producer prices increased considerably less over the twelve months ended in April than over the previous twelve months.
16,"At earlier stages of production, producer prices registered declines both in recent months and for the twelve months ended in April."
17,"An upward creep in the growth of labor costs was apparent in data on the hourly compensation of private industry workers; although the rise in the first three months of 1997 was smaller than the increase in the fourth quarter, the advance over the twelve months ended in March was larger than that over the previous twelve months."
18,"At its meeting on March 25, 1997, the Committee issued a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions; the firming of policy was taken in light of continued rapid growth of aggregate demand in the first quarter and the attendant greater risk of heightened pressures on resources and an upturn in inflation."
19,Market interest rates generally posted small mixed changes over the intermeeting period.
20,"Intermediate- and long-term yields rose over the early part of the intermeeting period, responding mostly to incoming data suggesting that growth in aggregate demand and output remained strong; these increases were subsequently more than reversed, however, as later information indicated that economic growth was moderating and price inflation remained subdued and on news of an agreement to balance the federal budget."
21,Major indexes of stock market prices fluctuated substantially over the period but they rose considerably on balance.
22,The movements of the dollar during the period roughly corresponded to the fluctuations in intermediate- and long-term U. S. interest rates; the dollar advanced strongly in April on growing expectations of a further firming of U. S. monetary policy but more than retraced that gain in May as the likelihood of further tightening waned.
23,The growth of M2 and M3 remained brisk over March and April.
24,The rapid growth of M3 was associated not only with the bulge in M2 but also with stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to fund the expansion of bank credit.
25,The growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated over recent months as a result of reductions in federal government borrowing.
26,"Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to remain fairly brisk over the forecast horizon."
27,"Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to be associated with moderating economic growth."
28,"Housing construction was projected to drift lower over coming quarters, partly in conjunction with the rise in mortgage interest rates that already had occurred but also in response to the smaller increases expected in household income."
29,The staff continued to anticipate that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity.
30,"With resource utilization high and labor compensation gradually accelerating, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher."
31,"In the Committee's discussion, the members agreed that the information for recent months pointed on balance to a marked slowing in the expansion of economic activity from a very rapid pace in late 1996 and earlier this year."
32,"The extent of the reduced growth in the current quarter and the prospects for subsequent quarters were subject to substantial uncertainty, but the members generally felt that the economy retained considerable underlying strength."
33,"In the circumstances and assuming no changes from current financial conditions, the individual members saw likely prospects for expansion over the forecast horizon at a pace close to, or a little above, the estimated growth of the economy's long-run potential."
34,"Many noted, however, that high levels of consumer and business confidence and supportive financial conditions among other factors suggested the possibility that growth could turn out to be even faster."
35,"With the utilization of productive resources, notably labor, already at particularly high levels in relation to the economy's potential, an outcome no stronger than current forecasts could well have adverse implications for inflation."
36,"Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential."
37,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to favorable underlying factors in the outlook for consumer spending, These included solid growth in consumer incomes, large increases in financial wealth, and currently high levels of consumer confidence."
38,"While more moderate growth in consumer spending for durable goods seemed likely after an extended period of robust expansion, these favorable factors suggested that the risks of a different outcome were tilted in the direction of faster-than-projected expansion."
39,"On balance, growth in consumer expenditures at a somewhat reduced pace approximating that of the expected expansion of disposable incomes appeared to be a reasonable prospect, though one that was subject to considerable uncertainty."
40,"Clearly, businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising compensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive markets."
41,"In the circumstances, it appeared unlikely that growth in capital outlays would moderate appreciably for some time."
42,"Concerning the outlook for housing, members referred to forecasts of a mild downtrend in residential construction associated with the increases that had occurred in mortgage interest rates."
43,"On balance, as evidenced by anecdotal reports from some areas, various factors including ongoing growth in employment and incomes, the availability of financing on still generally favorable terms, and the associated affordability of housing for many homeowners seemed likely to provide continued support for this sector of the economy for some period of time."
44,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter."
45,"While there were some indications of efforts to pare inventories in recent months, generally optimistic business sentiment and currently trim inventories in most industries might well foster efforts to accumulate stocks at a relatively rapid pace, especially if more-buoyant-than-anticipated sales were to stimulate a precautionary demand for inventories as had occurred in 1994."
46,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained subdued despite the rapid expansion in economic activity in recent quarters and the associated increase in pressures on already highly utilized resources."
47,"The appreciation of the dollar undoubtedly had helped to damp domestic inflation this year, and reported increases in consumer prices also had been held down to a marginal extent by an ongoing series of technical adjustments to the CPI."
48,"These were only partial explanations, however, and the members found it very difficult to account for the surprisingly benign behavior of inflation in an economy that had been operating at a level approximating full employment--indeed, possibly somewhat above sustainable full employment in labor markets in the view of a number of members, especially taking into consideration the recent further decline in the unemployment rate."
49,"On the basis of historical patterns, any overshooting of full employment would be expected to generate rising inflation over time."
50,"Although increases in labor compensation had been trending higher, these pressures were muted and had not shown through to prices."
51,Members focused on the possible role of faster-than-reported increases in productivity as a key explanation for the benign behavior of inflation in current circumstances.
52,"Business firms had continued to report robust profit margins in a period when competitive pressures generally prevented them from raising their prices, or raising them sufficiently, to pass on the increases that they were experiencing in worker compensation."
53,Standard statistical measures that pointed to relatively limited increases in productivity seemed inconsistent with strong profits as well as with anecdotal reports of sizable gains associated with widespread business restructuring activities and large additions of high-technology equipment to an increasingly efficient capital stock.
54,The ongoing development and spreading adoption of automated equipment along with the increasing skills and other infrastructure needed to use it effectively appeared to be creating growing efficiencies or synergies that were markedly enhancing productivity and enabling firms to hold the line on prices and maintain high profit margins.
55,"While these were welcome developments, members continued to express concern that, perhaps sooner rather than later, growing pressures on productive resources would be reflected in some upturn in overall inflation."
56,"Although most measures of labor compensation had been relatively favorable recently, such measures had been displaying a clear uptrend over a somewhat longer period, and it seemed likely that, if this trend continued, labor cost developments would at some point be reflected more fully in core measures of prices."
57,"Members commented that the timing and extent of any upturn in price inflation would depend on growth of overall demand in the economy, but they also believed that expansion of demand in line with their current expectations could induce a somewhat less favorable inflation experience during coming quarters."
58,"However, recent developments had underscored the fact that historical experience was not a fully reliable guide to the prospective behavior of prices; accordingly, the inflation outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty."
59,Those who endorsed a steady policy at this time agreed that some tightening might well be needed later to contain potentially rising inflation.
60,"For now, however, economic growth seemed to be slowing to a more sustainable pace, and the uncertainties surrounding the extent of the slowing and the outlook for inflation pointed to the desirability of a cautious approach to any policy tightening, especially given the persisting absence of a rising inflation trend in current measures of prices."
61,A number of members also observed that real interest rates were not unusually low.
62,"Thus, the present stance of monetary policy probably was not very far out of alignment with what likely would prove to be a desirable degree of restraint, thereby lessening any risk of large and persisting imbalances that a delay in implementing further restraint might incur."
63,"Members who preferred some tightening, at least in the near term if not necessarily at this meeting, noted that the Committee needed to weigh the risks of having to implement a small degree of restraint now versus considerably more later if inflation were allowed to build momentum."
64,"Monetary policy exerts its effects with a considerable lag, and a small but relatively prompt tightening action would provide some further insurance against an intensification of inflation."
65,"Such an outcome could be seen as more likely now, given the increased tightness in labor markets and the possibility that relatively strong growth would put added pressures on resources."
66,"Indeed, the strength of investment demand, the ready availability of financing, and possible favorable productivity gains argued that real rates of interest would need to be higher than historical norms to balance aggregate demand and supply."
67,"The risk of slightly lower economic growth needed to be compared with what they viewed as the greater risk of losing ground to inflation and thereby inhibiting the Committee's ability to reach its ultimate goal of price stability, a goal that all the members viewed as necessary to achieve maximum sustainable economic growth over time."
68,"Given the quiescence of inflation and the uncertainties surrounding its outlook, however, all but one of these members could accept a wait-and-see policy stance for now."
69,"While such a bias did not necessarily imply an intention to tighten policy during the weeks immediately ahead, it was consistent with the members' view that the risks were in the direction of a potential need for some tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, and that they might be required to make such a decision in the not-too-distant future."
70,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
71,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
72,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed after surging in late 1996 and earlier this year."
73,"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased at a considerably reduced pace over March and April, but the civilian unemployment rate fell appreciably to 4."
74,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January-February from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter.
75,Underlying price inflation has remained subdued.
76,"Market interest rates generally have posted small mixed changes since the Committee meeting on March 25, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably."
77,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
78,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
79,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
80,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
81,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
82,"Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the strength of investment demand, due possibly to an increase in the trend growth rate of productivity, required somewhat higher real interest rates to prevent inflationary pressures from developing."
83,"He was concerned that, with the economy already operating at a high level and labor markets apparently very tight, any increase in such pressures might be costly to reverse and might reduce the credibility of the Committee's longer-run strategy of promoting maximum sustainable growth by fostering price level stability."
84,He also believed that the risk to the economy of a moderate further tightening was small given the apparent momentum of aggregate economic activity.
