0,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1998 and 1999, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity had slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter.
2,"Consumer spending, business investment, and residential homebuilding, though remaining robust, apparently also were decelerating somewhat after very strong gains in the first quarter; and the erosion in net exports continued to damp demand for domestically produced goods."
3,"Payroll employment persisted on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production seemed likely to record only modest further expansion in the second quarter."
4,"Labor markets remained tight, and there were indications of some further acceleration in employment costs."
5,Recent data on consumer prices were a little less favorable than they had been earlier in the year.
6,Nonfarm payroll employment registered substantial increases in April and May despite further job losses in manufacturing.
7,The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.
8,"3 percent in May, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low through mid-June, after taking into account the onset of layoffs associated with the strike at General Motors."
9,"Although the growth in real outlays for services in April (latest data available) was held down by a small decline in purchases of energy services, the expansion of outlays for non-energy services remained brisk."
10,Available information suggested that the growth of business fixed investment slowed somewhat in the second quarter from a very strong pace earlier in the year.
11,"The recent upturn in building activity was consistent with the continuing indications of declining vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, but available data on construction contracts did not point to further strength in nonresidential construction."
12,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened further in April, as the value of exports declined more than that of imports."
13,"The Asian crises held down exports of the major European countries, partly offsetting the influence of strong domestic demand."
14,"Consumer prices advanced at a slightly faster rate in May as an upturn in energy prices and a large increase in food prices more than offset a slower rate of increase in the prices of nonfood, non- energy items."
15,"Core consumer prices accelerated during the three months ended in May, largely reflecting higher tobacco prices and shelter costs."
16,"Nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the twelve months ended in May than they had over the previous twelve months."
17,"At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy continued to rise at a subdued rate in May."
18,"For the twelve months ended in May, core producer prices rose by a small amount after having changed little in the year-earlier period."
19,"At the intermediate level, core producer prices edged down in May and were little changed on net over the twelve months ended in May."
20,"In light of concerns that growth in aggregate demand might remain so strong relative to the expansion of the economy's potential that inflationary pressures would tend to be generated, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate."
21,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
22,Market participants interpreted the further turmoil in financial markets in Asia and emerging market economies elsewhere as damping the outlook for U. S. economic growth and improving the chances that inflation would remain low.
23,"While most short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the period, yields on longer-term Treasury securities, and to a lesser extent on private debt instruments, declined somewhat, at least partly reflecting a further flight to safety and quality from renewed turbulence in a number of foreign markets."
24,"Share prices in U. S. equity markets remained volatile, and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period."
25,"The yen rebounded in mid-June in response to coordinated intervention by the Japanese and U. S. governments but soon renewed its downward drift, partly as a result of rising concerns that the Japanese government would not take prompt action to address weaknesses in the country's banking sector and in aggregate demand; the yen finished the period substantially lower on balance."
26,The dollar changed little on net against the German mark and other continental European currencies; declines in long-term interest rates in those countries generally matched the drop in yields on comparable U. S. instruments.
27,"The growth of M3 remained a little faster than that of M2, reflecting the further progress made by institution-only money market funds in attracting corporate cash-management business."
28,Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated somewhat after picking up earlier in the year; the moderation evidently reflected some slowing in the growth of business and household borrowing as well as paydowns of federal debt made possible by robust tax revenues.
29,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand more slowly over the projection period than it had in recent years.
30,"In addition, reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U. S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products."
31,"Housing demand was expected to remain at a generally high level in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat."
32,"Pressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually as gains in compensation increasingly outpaced improvements in productivity."
33,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members generally agreed that the expansion in economic activity was likely to be relatively moderate over coming quarters, and that such growth would be consistent with some limited increase in inflation from the current unusually low level."
34,"The accumulation of business inventories, which until recently had added substantially to economic growth, was expected to continue at a much lower and more sustainable pace."
35,"On the upside, in the absence of strongly retarding effects from developments in Asia, persistent strength in domestic final demand might well add to inflationary pressures."
36,"Indeed, there were signs of modestly rising inflation in some recent measures of prices, though the rate of inflation was still relatively subdued."
37,"In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1998 and 1999."
38,"The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1998 as a whole had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent, which implied some moderation over the second half from staff estimates at the time of this meeting of the average rate of growth in the first and second quarters; for 1999 the forecasts pointed to moderate growth and were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent."
39,These projected rates of economic growth were accompanied by a very slight rise in the civilian rate of unemployment over the next 18 months to still quite low rates centering on 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999.
40,"With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 1998 and 4-1/4 to 5 percent for 1999."
41,"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, indicated a slightly faster rise over the second half of this year and in 1999, largely because of expectations that the plunge in energy prices earlier in the year would not be repeated."
42,"Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 1-3/4 to 2 percent for 1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 per cent in 1999."
43,"In their review of developments in different parts of the country, Reserve Bank presidents reported high levels of business activity across the nation, but several also indicated that there were signs of some slowing in the expansion of regional economic activity."
44,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices."
45,"The apparent deceleration in retail sales could prove to be temporary, though some slowing in the growth of overall consumer spending over the forecast horizon, perhaps to a pace more in line with the growth of disposable income, was viewed as a reasonable expectation, especially with equity price gains of recent years unlikely to be repeated."
46,"The latter included the ready availability of debt and equity financing on relatively attractive terms, and opportunities to invest in high-tech equipment at lower prices to enhance productivity and hold down labor costs in a period of very tight labor markets."
47,"While these factors were expected to continue to support appreciable further expansion in business investment, growth in demand for capital goods was likely to diminish as a result of the projected slowing in the expansion of final sales and business profits and the absence of pressure on manufacturing capacity."
48,"With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction, members reported that declining vacancy rates and rising prices and rents of office buildings and to some extent other commercial structures were fostering very high levels of construction activity in several areas."
49,There were widespread anecdotal and other reports of high levels of home sales and few reports of faltering housing demand.
50,"Favorable factors undergirding current housing activity, including the robust growth in employment and incomes, high wealth-to-income ratios, and very attractive terms on home mortgages, seemed likely to continue to hold housing construction close to current elevated levels."
51,"From the standpoint of the United States, the Asian crisis and its repercussions around the world obviously were deepening the nation's trade deficit, but other effects such as those on U. S. interest rates and prices in world commodity markets, notably oil, were boosting domestic demand and tended to have a moderating near-term influence on inflation."
52,"With regard to the outlook for prices and wages, members observed that some key measures of price inflation had displayed a modest uptilt recently."
53,"Though overall price inflation had remained subdued when viewed over a longer horizon, signs of a continuing acceleration, should they become evident, would be a matter of growing concern."
54,"Reflecting very tight labor markets, the rate of increase in labor compensation had been on an uptrend, but the rise in unit labor costs and overall unit product costs had been held down to a very modest pace by gains in productivity."
55,"At some point, however, the advance in labor compensation would exceed likely improvements in productivity by an increasing margin unless the expansion in overall demand, and hence in labor demand, moderated significantly."
56,"Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities."
57,"Any tendency for faster increases in labor costs to feed through to price inflation was likely to be reinforced for a time by the unwinding of a number of special factors that had tended to hold inflation down, including the decline in energy prices in recent quarters and the dollar's appreciation during 1997."
58,"Moreover, a rise in inflation would tend to erode currently favorable inflation expectations and lead workers to demand higher nominal compensation."
59,"Nonetheless, questions could be raised about how rapidly and to what extent the effects of tight labor markets would show through to higher labor compensation and overall producer costs and in turn how quickly the latter would induce significantly faster increases in prices."
60,"Very competitive domestic and international markets for a wide range of products along with reduced prices of oil, other commodities, and imports more generally could well keep inflation in check for some time."
61,It was noted in this regard that members had tended in recent years to anticipate greater inflation than had materialized.
62,"In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1998 and also decided on tentative ranges for those aggregates in 1999."
63,An unchanged range of 3 to 7 percent also was set in February for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1998.
64,"They took note of a staff projection that indicated that, given the Committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates, growth of M2 and M3 probably would exceed the current ranges in 1998 and decline to a little below the upper end of those ranges in 1999."
65,"In their discussion of the choice of ranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1998 and 1999, the members agreed that those ranges should not reflect forecasts of money growth under anticipated economic and financial conditions, but instead should be viewed as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with price stability and sustained economic growth, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience."
66,Reaffirming the current ranges for 1998 and extending them to 1999 would thus underscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over time.
67,"In the view of a few members, the Committee should consider adopting ranges centered on its expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates in the future, but only if the members became more confident about the relationship between the growth of money and measures of aggregate economic performance and undertook to give more weight to the growth of the broad monetary aggregates in setting monetary policy."
68,Some members noted that retention of the current monetary ranges oriented toward price stability did not preclude greater use of the aggregates in assessing overall financial conditions and the formulation of monetary policy.
69,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.
70,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to reaffirm the ranges for growth of M2, M3, and total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established in February for 1998 and to extend those ranges on a tentative basis to 1999."
71,"Accordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following statement regarding the 1998 and 1999 ranges in its domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
72,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
73,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
74,"For 1999, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3."
75,The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1999.
76,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
77,"Although recent developments had increased both the upside and the downside uncertainties in the economic outlook, most of the members felt that the risks continued to point on balance toward rising inflation."
78,"While the available evidence suggested that the economic expansion had in fact slowed considerably in the second quarter, largely because of reduced inventory accumulation against the backdrop of weakness in the foreign trade sector, the retarding effects of those factors were seen as likely to wane over coming quarters and there were only limited indications of any softening in domestic final demand."
79,"Moreover, the persistence of accommodative financial conditions, as evidenced by the ample availability of financing on favorable terms to business and household borrowers and by robust monetary growth, might well continue to support relatively strong domestic spending."
80,"As a consequence, many of the members expressed concern that the expansion in demand might continue at a fast enough pace to raise pressures on wages and prices over time."
81,"To be sure, U. S. monetary policy had to be set ultimately on the basis of the needs of the U. S. economy, but recognition had to be given to the feedback of developments abroad on the domestic economy."
82,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad."
83,"A number of these members emphasized, however, that they continued to see a high probability that some tightening of monetary policy would be needed later to curb rising inflationary pressures."
84,"Accordingly, they believed that the Committee should take advantage of any early opportunity to tighten policy in order to improve the prospects of containing inflation and prolonging the economic expansion."
85,"One member was persuaded, however, that such a policy move should be implemented at this meeting in order to avert the need for a stronger and probably more disruptive policy adjustment that would be needed later to head off rising inflation."
86,"Given that the balance of risks was seen as pointing to rising inflation over time, the members agreed that it was desirable to retain the tilt toward restraint in the directive."
87,Such a tilt would continue to underscore the Committee's commitment to its long-run objective of price stability and its view of the likely direction of the next policy move.
88,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
89,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
90,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter."
91,"Nonfarm payroll employment registered another substantial increase in May, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4."
92,Available indicators suggest that growth of business fixed investment also is slowing after a surge earlier in the year.
93,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services continued to widen in April.
94,Developments in the food and energy sectors contributed to a slightly faster advance in consumer prices in May.
95,"Most short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on May 19, but longer-term rates have declined somewhat."
96,Share prices in U. S. equity markets remained volatile and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period.
97,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
98,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
99,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
100,"For 1999, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3."
101,The Committee provisionally set the associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1999.
102,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
103,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
104,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
105,Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the unsustainably rapid growth of domestic demand--fueled by the acceleration of money and credit growth in the past year--was reflected in the recent sharp increase in imports and rising trade deficits.
106,"As U. S. output growth slows significantly from the rapid pace of 1997 and early 1998, it will be essential that domestic demand also slow."
107,The very welcome progress toward eliminating inflation in recent years has contributed to the outstanding performance of the economy.
108,Allowing domestic demand to continue to exceed domestic production would run the risk that corrosive effects of rising inflation would undermine future growth prospects.
109,"Furthermore, the resultant trade and current account deficits would have to be matched by ever larger inflows of foreign capital."
110,Modest monetary restraint at this time might prevent either the buildup of inflationary imbalances that would eventually necessitate future policy restraint or unsustainable capital flows.
