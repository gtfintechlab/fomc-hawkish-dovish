0,The information reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed substantially from its rapid first-quarter pace.
1,The demand for labor appeared to moderate as hiring stepped down in recent months.
2,"Consumer price inflation remained elevated in April and May, reflecting sharp rises in energy prices and more rapid increases in core prices."
3,The unemployment rate was 4.
4,"Industrial production edged down in May after strong growth in April, largely reflecting the patterns of manufacturing output."
5,"For the year to date, manufacturing production advanced at a rate significantly below its rapid fourth-quarter growth rate but only a bit below its average pace of expansion since mid-2003."
6,Real consumer spending appeared to be on track to decelerate noticeably in the current quarter after posting robust growth in the first quarter.
7,The slowing reflected both a marked reduction in the growth in real outlays for motor vehicles from an elevated first-quarter pace and a moderation in the advance of real expenditures for other goods in recent months.
8,"The level of nominal wages and salaries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised down considerably, and rising consumer prices held down the gains in real disposable income."
9,Higher interest rates also likely restrained spending.
10,"Nonetheless, despite recent declines in equity prices, the wealth-to-income ratio remained well above its historical average, and consumer sentiment, which dipped in May, rebounded some in early June."
11,The most reliable measures of house prices indicated modest growth following the rapid increases seen last year.
12,Spending on high-tech equipment and software advanced at a slower pace in the second quarter as a flattening out of spending on communications equipment after a huge increase in the first quarter offset some pickup in business-sector demand for computers and software.
13,Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high projected energy prices.
14,"In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories."
15,"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in April, reflecting a large increase in imports coupled with a slight decline in exports."
16,Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods.
17,"Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed."
18,"Incoming data pointed to a possible slowing in Canada, but signs of further expansion in the euro area and of continued growth in Japan were evident, notwithstanding sharp declines in equity indexes in these countries."
19,"Headline inflation picked up in April and May, driven partly by sharp increases in the prices of petroleum-based products."
20,"In contrast, natural gas prices continued to decline in response to excess supply, fully reversing last autumn's rises."
21,Higher oil prices showed through to producer prices for a variety of energy-intensive intermediate goods.
22,"Consumer food prices decelerated markedly since January, reflecting slower price increases for food away from home and declines, on balance, in the prices of fruits and vegetables."
23,Core price inflation rose less than headline inflation in April and May but above its pace earlier in the year.
24,"Core prices were boosted in part by an acceleration in shelter costs, especially those imputed for owner-occupied residences."
25,"Readings on the growth of labor costs were revised down for the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006, but recent data suggested a pickup in the second quarter."
26,A number of indicators of inflation expectations largely reversed increases recorded in the spring.
27,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.
28,"The Committee saw growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."
29,"At that time, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation."
30,"Ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remained contained."
31,"Still, possible increases in resource utilization and the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures."
32,"In these circumstances, the Committee foresaw the possibility of a need for some further policy firming to address inflation risks but emphasized that the extent and timing of any such firming would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information."
33,"Subsequent data releases reporting higher-than-expected inflation, the release of the FOMC minutes, and speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers all led investors to push up their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate."
34,"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased by more than those on nominal securities, and the resulting decline in inflation compensation retraced a substantial share of the rise that had occurred over the preceding intermeeting period."
35,Major stock price indexes fell sharply over the period.
36,"In the household sector, mortgage borrowing slowed in response to more subdued housing activity and moderating house-price appreciation."
37,"M2 growth in the second quarter was tepid, as the growth of nominal income had apparently softened and rising opportunity cost continued to dampen demand for money."
38,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that, after the significant deceleration of real GDP in the current quarter from the first quarter of 2006, growth would proceed through the end of 2007 at a pace a bit below the rate of growth of the economy's potential."
39,"The outlook for modest growth of real GDP reflected a slowdown in the housing market, the effects of past policy tightening, and a diminished boost to consumer spending from increases in household wealth."
40,"Core consumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in the second quarter from its average pace over the preceding several quarters but to then drop back somewhat, albeit to a level higher than previously forecasted, as energy and import prices flatten out and some slack emerges in labor and product markets."
41,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw economic growth as having moderated in the second quarter from its robust pace in the first quarter, reflecting a cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."
42,"All participants found the elevated readings on core inflation of recent months to be of concern and, if sustained, inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability."
43,"However, contained inflation expectations, the abatement of upward pressure from past increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the slowing in the growth of economic activity that was under way were expected to contribute to a moderation in core inflation in coming quarters."
44,"Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs."
45,"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2006 and 2007, conditioned on the participants' views of the appropriate path for monetary policy."
46,"These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, with a central tendency at both horizons of 4-3/4 to 5 percent."
47,"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the change in the average fourth-quarter core PCE price index from a year earlier, ranged from 2-1/4 to 3 percent for this year, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and the range and central tendency were 2 to 2-1/4 percent for next year."
48,Several participants pointed out that the decline was broadly in line with expectations in light of the tightening in monetary policy and the rapid run-up in home prices and residential construction in recent years.
49,The growth of consumer spending had dropped off significantly in the second quarter from a robust pace earlier in the year.
50,The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates.
51,"Some retailers, especially those catering to lower- and middle-income customers, reported weaker growth in sales."
52,Consumer spending was expected to advance modestly in coming quarters as the effects of more moderate gains in home prices and a gradual rebound in the household saving rate from recent historically low levels were offset by further gains in employment and growth in labor income.
53,"In a shift from the pattern observed in the past few years, some contacts suggested that businesses were now directing their capital expenditures toward expanding capacity rather than increasing efficiency, a signal of the anticipation of continued solid growth in demand."
54,Participants observed that many foreign central banks had tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period in response to strengthening activity and indications of inflation pressures.
55,Greater uncertainty about inflation pressures and the needed policy response had perhaps contributed to a reassessment of risks by investors globally.
56,"Despite the tighter policy, however, economic growth in the United States' major trading partners appeared likely to remain solid, supporting U. S. exports."
57,Participants also discussed the role of global capacity utilization in the inflation process.
58,All meeting participants expressed concern about recent elevated readings on core inflation.
59,A key issue was the extent to which this spring's increase in inflation reflected transitory or persistent influences.
60,Many noted that a number of factors were temporarily boosting inflation.
61,The pass-through of the substantial rise in energy prices could account for a considerable part of the step-up in core inflation in recent quarters.
62,"In addition, rising rents had been boosting the cost of shelter and so contributing to the increase in core inflation."
63,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters."
64,"In sum, with inflation expectations contained and unit labor costs held down by ongoing gains in productivity and modest advances in compensation, inflation was seen by most participants as likely to edge down."
65,"Nevertheless, several factors were cited as potentially sustaining upward pressure on inflation, and the range of participants' forecasts for core inflation in 2007 rose by 1/4 percentage point relative to the range of forecasts made in February."
66,The relatively taut resource markets and the lagged effects of the increase in energy prices raised the possibility that inflation could continue at somewhat elevated levels for some time.
67,"Higher levels of inflation, should they persist, could become embedded in inflation expectations."
68,"In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period."
69,"All Committee members agreed that raising the target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5-1/4 percent, at this meeting was appropriate given the recent readings on inflation and the associated deterioration in the inflation outlook."
70,Such an action would also help preserve the decline in inflation expectations that had occurred over the intermeeting period and which appeared to be conditioned on an outlook for a policy firming.
71,"Some members favored a shorter statement that focused on the Committee's desire to see core inflation decline from its recent elevated levels, while others were inclined to provide more information about the forces that would likely influence the future path of policy."
72,"In light of the possibility that the lessening of inflation pressures could be more limited than consistent with sustained good performance of the economy, members agreed to indicate that ""[a]lthough the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time ."
73,"some inflation risks remain. """
74,"To indicate that policy action at future meetings was not foreordained and would depend on the forecasts for inflation and activity in the medium term, the Committee agreed to state that ""[t]he extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
75,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
76,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain."
77,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
