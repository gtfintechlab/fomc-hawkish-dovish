0,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate.
2,"Growth of private domestic final demand had slowed from its pace in the first half of the year, though it was still relatively robust, and reduced spending on U. S. exports and rising import competition were exerting appreciable restraint on overall activity, as was a slowing in inventory investment."
3,"Reflecting the moderation in growth from the first half of the year, total payroll employment was trending up at a somewhat slower pace."
4,"Despite the pressures on labor resources associated with still-tight labor markets, trends in wages and prices remained stable."
5,Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed somewhat over the July-August period.
6,"Outside of manufacturing, employment increases remained strong in the service-producing industries, and even though anecdotal reports continued to indicate shortages of skilled workers, further sizable job gains were recorded in construction."
7,The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.
8,"Outside the motor vehicle sector, however, output had changed little on balance over recent months in association with the erosion in net exports stemming from the turmoil in Asia and its repercussions on a number of other U. S. trading partners; production of consumer goods edged down on balance in July and August, and the growth of output of business equipment slowed."
9,Available indicators pointed to more moderate growth in business fixed investment after the surge in capital spending during the first half of the year.
10,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in July from its second-quarter average, with the value of imports falling more than the value of exports."
11,"Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries other than Japan decelerated on average in the second quarter, with a deterioration in net exports partially offsetting continued strength in domestic final demand."
12,"In Japan, activity contracted for a third consecutive quarter; net exports made a large positive contribution as imports dropped sharply, but domestic demand, most notably business fixed investment, fell steeply."
13,Both the overall and the core CPI again rose moderately in August; a further increase in food prices was offset by a sizable decrease in energy prices.
14,"For the twelve months ended in August, core consumer prices rose slightly more than they had in the year-earlier period."
15,"At the producer level, prices of finished goods dropped appreciably in August, largely reflecting declines in the prices of finished foods and, notably, energy goods."
16,Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy moved slightly higher in the twelve months ended in August after having edged down in the year- earlier period.
17,"Producer prices at earlier stages of production were under strong downward pressure; prices of intermediate materials fell during the year ended in August by slightly more than they had risen in the year-earlier period, and prices of crude materials plunged further in the twelve months ended in August."
18,"However, in light of mounting financial strains abroad, their potential implications for the U. S. economy, and less accommodative conditions in domestic financial markets, the Committee concluded that the risks to the outlook were no longer tilted toward rising inflation but had become more balanced."
19,The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
20,"In an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility in financial asset values worldwide and a reduced appetite for risk among many investors, interest rates on U. S. Treasury securities, and to a much smaller extent on investment-grade corporate debt, fell appreciably during the intermeeting period; in contrast, yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms increased sharply, and a number of large banks tightened terms and standards for making business loans to sizable firms."
21,"Share prices in U. S. and foreign equity markets remained volatile during the intermeeting period, and major U. S. equity price indexes declined considerably further on balance."
22,"For the year through September, both aggregates recorded growth rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year."
23,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting incorporated a considerably weaker assessment of underlying aggregate demand, owing to downward revisions to growth abroad and to the less accommodative conditions that were evolving in U. S. financial markets."
24,The staff projected that the expansion of economic activity would slow for a time to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential and then would pick up to a rate more in line with that potential.
25,Damped expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for a period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.
26,"In addition, private final demand would be restrained by tighter lending terms and conditions as well as the drop that had occurred in equity prices."
27,"Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year."
28,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on developments that pointed to the potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending."
29,They recognized that there were at present few statistical indications that the economy was on a significantly slower growth track.
30,"In addition, it was generating lower equity prices and tightening credit availability in U. S. financial markets."
31,"Though labor markets were expected to remain relatively tight for some time, the members saw little prospect that inflation would gather significant momentum in coming quarters."
32,Declining commodity and other import prices would be restraining prices and inflation expectations for a while.
33,"Overall consumer prices might rise a little more rapidly next year as the effects of a number of favorable factors, such as falling energy prices, diminished or reversed, but underlying inflation was expected to stay quite subdued as inflation expectations remained damped and pressures in labor markets became less pronounced."
34,"Strong demands for safety and liquidity had driven down yields on U. S. Treasury securities, but spreads of private rates over Treasury rates had gapped higher."
35,"The members did not believe that the tightness in credit markets and strong demand for safety and liquidity were likely to lead to a ""credit crunch, "" though some members expressed the view that such an outcome could not be ruled out."
36,"The decline in stock market prices also appeared likely to damp the growth of consumer spending over time, with added implications for business capital expenditures."
37,"Consumer expenditures, though temporarily held back by shortages of new motor vehicles stemming from the work stoppage at General Motors, had remained on a solid uptrend, with overall growth in recent months apparently slipping only a little from a remarkably rapid pace in the first half of the year."
38,Strong growth in jobs and incomes along with substantial further increases in stock market prices through mid-July had fostered a high level of consumer confidence and spending.
39,"Members commented that the more recent weakness in the stock market and the related decline in household net worth had removed an important support for the growth of consumer spending, but they noted that recent surveys indicated only a slight deterioration in consumer sentiment and that the stimulus from earlier stock market gains probably would dissipate only gradually."
40,"Looking further ahead, consumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more in line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in recent years."
41,Declining relative prices and rapid technological advances were likely to generate appreciable further growth in spending for computer and office equipment over the projection horizon.
42,"Even so, the members anticipated that the pronounced increase in investor and lender perceptions of risk would result in considerable moderation in the growth of overall business investment, especially in light of concurrent expectations of reduced gains in sales and profits and evidence of some diminution in both internal and external sources of financing."
43,In a number of cases they already had seen a substantial downturn in their exports or a surge in competing imports at prices they found difficult to match.
44,"Very favorable underlying factors, including a strong job market and declining mortgage rates, had helped to sustain homebuilding activity at an elevated level."
45,The large further advance in stock market prices earlier in the year also appeared to have been a positive factor in the strong performance of the housing market.
46,"While anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point."
47,"Even so, the continued affordability of new homes for many households was likely to sustain housing demand at a relatively high albeit diminished level, and homebuilding activity would be bolstered for a time as backlogs created by shortages of skilled construction workers in many areas were worked off."
48,"Net exports, while subject to a great deal of uncertainty, were seen as likely to continue to restrain demand and production to a substantial extent over coming quarters."
49,"Members cited examples from across the country of business firms, notably in the manufacturing sector but also in energy, agriculture, forest products, and some other industries, that already were being adversely affected by weaker export markets and increased competition from lower-priced imports."
50,"Moreover, the intensification of turmoil in international financial markets since the Russian devaluation and debt moratorium had led to tighter financial conditions in key U. S. trading partners--especially in the Americas--a development that was likely to weaken growth in those markets and demand for U. S. products."
51,"In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members referred to the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation and to indications of escalating increases in labor compensation in a number of areas."
52,"At the same time, price inflation generally had remained subdued, with little evidence of acceleration."
53,"As had been true for an extended period, competitive pressures were widely reported to be preventing employers from passing through rising labor costs to consumer prices."
54,"Looking ahead, members cited a variety of factors bearing on the prospects for inflation that on the whole suggested that the risks of an inflationary uptrend had receded."
55,"Favorable factors in the outlook for prices included the lingering effects of the dollar's earlier appreciation, ample industrial capacity, generally declining commodity and other import prices, and an apparently more rapid trend of productivity gains."
56,"Over time, some slowing in economic growth and less intense pressures on labor resources would hold down increases in labor costs."
57,"Developments that might tend to offset these positive factors, at least in part, included a possible turnaround in energy prices after sizable declines over the past year and an upturn in the costs of worker benefits, notably for medical expenses."
58,"A few members also observed that the rapid growth of key monetary aggregates, including M2, over a period of several quarters was a worrisome element in the outlook for inflation, though the most recent surge in M2 probably was induced in large measure by a flight to quality and liquidity."
59,"In their view, such an action was desirable to cushion the likely adverse consequences on future domestic economic activity of the global financial turmoil that had weakened foreign economies and of the tighter conditions in financial markets in the United States that had resulted in part from that turmoil."
60,"In the view of many members, equity prices and risk spreads in U. S. financial markets previously had embodied an overly optimistic assessment of business prospects and they saw some correction in these markets as a positive development."
61,"On balance, however, credit conditions were likely to remain tighter and equity prices lower than earlier, and in the context of continued damped inflation, monetary policy had the room to adjust to these new circumstances."
62,"Several emphasized in this regard that although the risk of rising inflation might have receded, it was still present, especially in light of the persistence to date of very tight labor markets and relatively robust economic growth."
63,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
64,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
65,"Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has been growing at a moderate rate, paced by brisk, albeit slowing, increases in spending by businesses and households, while expansion in overall economic activity has continued to be restrained by developments abroad."
66,"Nonfarm payroll employment grew somewhat more slowly over July and August, mostly reflecting job losses in the manufacturing sector; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4."
67,"Available indicators point to continued growth in business capital spending, but at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year."
68,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in July from its second-quarter average.
69,Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months.
70,"Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since the meeting on August 18, though yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms have increased and a number of large banks have tightened terms and standards for making business loans."
71,Share prices in U. S. and global equity markets have remained volatile and major indexes have declined considerably further on balance over the intermeeting period.
72,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
73,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
74,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
75,"For 1999, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
76,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
77,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate might or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
78,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
79,"Conference Call In a telephone conference held on October 15, 1998, the Committee members discussed recent economic and financial developments and their implications for monetary policy."
