3,Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the December 15-16 meeting suggested that the recovery in economic activity was gaining momentum.
4,"The pace of job losses slowed noticeably in recent months, and total hours worked increased in November; however, the unemployment rate remained quite elevated."
5,"Both imports and exports continued to recover from their depressed levels of earlier this year, and the U. S. trade deficit in September and October was wider than in earlier months."

9,"Continuing claims for unemployment insurance through regular state programs also moved down, but the average length of spells of unemployment continued to increase."
10,"Housing construction held fairly steady in recent months, while demand for housing continued to firm."
11,"The recent increases in sales likely reflected improved fundamentals: The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages declined to less than 5 percent, and surveys suggested that households now expected home prices to be fairly stable over the next year."
12,"Although some house price indexes declined a little in September and October, they remained above the troughs reached last spring."
13,"Also in the third quarter, vacancy rates on nonresidential properties rose further, and property prices continued to fall amid difficult financing conditions."
14,The U. S. international trade deficit was somewhat wider in September and October than in previous months.
15,The limited data relating to the fourth quarter suggested that economic activity advanced in all of those economies.
16,"Third-quarter real GDP growth was surprisingly strong in several emerging market economies, most notably Mexico and India."
17,"In emerging Asia and in Latin America, indicators suggested that economic activity was expanding somewhat less rapidly, but still briskly, in the fourth quarter."
18,"Price pressures remained subdued in most of the advanced foreign economies, although headline inflation generally moved up."
19,"Headline inflation also increased in emerging Asia, generally from low levels, but declined further in Latin America, likely in part because of the recent appreciation of several Latin American currencies."
20,"In the United States, the latest data indicated that total consumer price inflation turned up in recent months, while core consumer price inflation remained subdued."
21,The higher readings on headline consumer price inflation were the result of a rebound in energy prices.
22,Core consumer prices increased modestly in October and were unchanged in November.
23,"Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers declined in early December, and the same survey's measure of longer-term inflation expectations moved down to the lower end of the narrow range that prevailed over the previous few years."
24,"Revised data showed solid increases in hourly compensation in the second and third quarters, along with quite rapid productivity growth and a further decline in unit labor costs."
25,"Incoming economic data, while somewhat better than expected, seemed to have little net effect on interest rate expectations."
26,"Consistent with the decrease in short-term interest rates, yields on 2-year nominal off-the-run Treasury securities declined slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period."
27,"Inflation compensation based on 5-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) increased, apparently owing in part to an announcement by the Treasury of a smaller-than-expected amount of issuance of TIPS next year."
28,"Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead also rose, and was near the upper end of its range in recent years."
29,"However, high demand for Treasury bills maturing just past December 31 drove yields on such issues to zero in some recent auctions."
30,"Over the intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes increased further."
31,"The rise in share prices likely reflected the improvement in the economic outlook and strong third-quarter earnings, which led analysts to mark up their estimates of future earnings."

36,"The dollar depreciated over much of the intermeeting period, but then reversed course following the release of better-than-expected U. S. data on employment and retail sales for November."
37,It announced that the one-year refinancing operation in December would be its last and that the cost of the funds provided would float with interest rates set in future refinancing operations rather than being fixed as in previous such operations.
38,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the December FOMC meeting, the staff raised its projection for average real GDP growth in the second half of 2009 somewhat, and it also modestly increased its forecast for economic growth in 2010 and 2011."
39,"Better-than-expected data on employment, consumer spending, home sales, and industrial production received during the intermeeting period pointed to a somewhat stronger increase in real GDP in the current quarter than had previously been projected."
40,"In addition, the positive signal from the incoming data, along with the sizable upward revisions to household income in earlier quarters and more supportive financial market conditions, led to small upward adjustments to projected growth in real GDP over the rest of the forecast period."
41,"The staff again anticipated that the recovery would strengthen in 2010 and 2011, supported by further improvement in financial conditions and household balance sheets, continued recovery in the housing sector, growing household and business confidence, and accommodative monetary policy, even as the impetus to real activity from fiscal policy diminished."
42,"However, the projected pace of real output growth in 2010 and 2011 was expected to exceed that of potential output by only enough to produce a very gradual reduction in economic slack."
43,The staff forecast for inflation was nearly unchanged.
44,The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory.
45,"Thus, the staff continued to project that core inflation would slow somewhat from its current pace over the next two years."
46,"Moreover, the staff expected that headline consumer price inflation would decline to about the same rate as core inflation in 2010 and 2011."
47,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts suggested that economic growth was strengthening in the fourth quarter, that firms were reducing payrolls at a less rapid pace, and that downside risks to the outlook for economic growth had diminished a bit further."
48,"Although some of the recent data had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with the projections for moderate growth and subdued inflation in 2010 that they had submitted just before the Committee's November 3-4 meeting; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably."
49,"Participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but, consistent with experience following previous financial crises, most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions."
50,"A moderate pace of expansion would imply slow improvement in the labor market next year, with unemployment declining only gradually."
51,Participants agreed that underlying inflation currently was subdued and was likely to remain so for some time.
52,"Some noted the risk that, over the next couple of years, inflation could edge further below the rates they judged most consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability; others saw inflation risks as tilted toward the upside in the medium term."
53,A number of factors were expected to support near-term expansion in economic activity.
54,"The outlook for growth abroad had improved since earlier in the year, auguring well for U. S. exports."
55,"In addition, financial market conditions generally had become more supportive of economic growth."
56,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity."
57,"Business contacts again emphasized they would be cautious in adding to payrolls and capital spending, even as demand for their products increases."
58,"Though the near-term outlook remains uncertain, participants generally thought the most likely outcome was that economic growth would gradually strengthen over the next two years as financial conditions improved further, leading to more-substantial increases in resource utilization."
59,"Financial market conditions were generally regarded as having become more supportive of continued economic recovery during the intermeeting period: Equity prices rose further, private credit spreads narrowed somewhat, and financial markets generally continued to function significantly better than early in the year."
60,"Bank loans, however, continued to contract sharply in all categories, reflecting lack of demand, deterioration in potential borrowers' credit quality, uncertainty about the economic outlook, and banks' concerns about their own capital positions."
61,"While survey evidence suggested that small businesses considered weak demand to be a larger problem than access to credit, participants saw limited credit availability as a potential constraint on future investment and hiring by small businesses, which normally are a significant source of employment growth in recoveries."
62,"The weakness in labor markets continued to be an important concern to meeting participants, who generally expected unemployment to remain elevated for quite some time."
63,"The unemployment rate was not the only indicator pointing to substantial slack in labor markets: The employment-to-population ratio had fallen to a 25-year low, and aggregate hours of production workers had dropped more than during the 1981-82 recession."
64,"Although the November employment report was considerably better than anticipated, several participants observed that more than one good report would be needed to provide convincing evidence of recovery in the labor market."
65,Participants also noted that the slowing pace of employment declines mainly reflected a diminished pace of layoffs; few firms were hiring.
66,"Moreover, the unusually large fraction of those individuals with jobs who were working part time for economic reasons, as well as the uncommonly low level of the average workweek, pointed to only a gradual decline in unemployment as the economic recovery proceeded."
67,"Indeed, many business contacts again reported that they would be cautious in their hiring, saying they expected to meet any near-term increase in demand by raising their existing employees' hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add employees."
68,"The necessity of reallocating labor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as the loss of skills caused by high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations, also could limit the pace of employment gains."
69,"Nonetheless, the reported rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months could presage a broader increase in job growth and thus was a welcome development."
70,"Retail sales increased, spurred by price discounting."
71,"Those revisions, along with recent gains in equity prices, suggested a smaller probability that households would reduce spending to rebuild their savings more rapidly."
72,"However, uncertain job prospects, modest growth in real incomes, tight credit, and wealth levels that remained relatively low despite this years rise in equity prices and stabilization in house prices were seen as likely to weigh on consumer confidence and the growth of consumer spending for some time to come."
73,"This adjustment likely was making an important contribution to economic growth in the fourth quarter, and participants expected that it would do so into 2010 as well."
74,"Even so, many participants expressed the view that cautious business sentiment, together with low industrial utilization rates, was likely to keep new capital spending subdued until firms became more confident about the durability of increases in demand."
75,"In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had risen relative to the very low levels reported in the spring; moreover, house prices appeared to be stabilizing and in some areas had reportedly moved higher."
76,"However, some participants still viewed the improved outlook as quite tentative and again pointed to potential sources of softness, including the termination next year of the temporary tax credits for homebuyers and the downward pressure that further increases in foreclosures could put on house prices."
77,"Stronger foreign economic activity, especially in the emerging market economies in Asia, as well as the partial reversal this year of the dollar's appreciation during the latter part of 2008, was providing further support to U. S. exports, including agricultural exports."
78,"Further improvements in foreign economies would likely buoy U. S. exports going forward, but import growth would also strengthen as the recovery took hold in the United States."
79,Participants noted that any tendency for dollar depreciation to put significant upward pressure on inflation would bear close watching.
80,"Most participants anticipated that substantial slack in labor and product markets, along with well-anchored inflation expectations, would keep inflation subdued in the near term, although they had differing views as to the relative importance of those two factors."
81,"The decelerations in wages and unit labor costs this year, and the accompanying deceleration in marginal costs, were cited as factors putting downward pressure on inflation."
82,"Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggested that most firms had little ability to raise their prices in the current economic environment."
83,"Some participants noted, however, that rising prices of oil and other commodities, along with increases in import prices, could boost inflation pressures going forward."
84,"Overall, many participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlooks as being roughly balanced."
85,"Some saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, reflecting the quite elevated level of economic slack and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to the low level of actual inflation."
86,"But others felt that inflation risks were tilted to the upside, particularly in the medium term, because of the possibility that inflation expectations could rise as a result of the public's concerns about extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and large federal budget deficits."
87,"A rapid shift, if not offset by Federal Reserve actions, could give excessive impetus to spending and potentially result in expected and actual inflation higher than would be consistent with price stability."
88,"To keep inflation expectations anchored, all participants agreed that monetary policy would need to be responsive to any significant improvement or worsening in the economic outlook and that the Federal Reserve would need to continue to clearly communicate its ability and intent to begin withdrawing monetary policy accommodation at the appropriate time and pace."
89,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members agreed that no changes to the Committee's large-scale asset purchase programs, or to its target range for the federal funds rate, were warranted at this meeting, inasmuch as the economic outlook had changed little since the November meeting."
90,"A few members noted that resource slack was expected to diminish only slowly and observed that it might become desirable at some point in the future to provide more policy stimulus by expanding the planned scale of the Committee's large-scale asset purchases and continuing them beyond the first quarter, especially if the outlook for economic growth were to weaken or if mortgage market functioning were to deteriorate."
91,"The Committee maintained the federal funds target range at 0 to 1/4 percent and, based on the outlook for a slow economic recovery, decided to reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions, including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates for an extended period."
92,"Although members generally saw little risk that maintaining very low short-term interest rates could raise inflation expectations or create instability in asset markets, they noted that it was important to remain alert to these risks."
93,Members emphasized that they were prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.
94,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
95,The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.
96,"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
97,"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating."
98,"Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
99,Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.
100,"Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
101,"With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
102,"The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
103,"The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. """
104,"Following the Committee's policy decision, staff gave several presentations on the key determinants of inflation dynamics."
105,Theoretical and empirical research indicates that inflation can respond to deviations of economic activity from its longer-run sustainable path.
106,"However, in some theoretical frameworks, the connection between resource slack and inflation depends on the nature of the shock and its impact on marginal costs and markups."
107,"Moreover, estimates of the magnitude of slack and its effect on inflation are sensitive to the details of the analytical framework and the statistical methodology used in each study."
108,"While theory suggests that the degree of slack prevailing in foreign economies could affect domestic inflation, empirical evidence on the importance of such an effect was mixed."
109,"Evidence suggested that sizable shifts in the longer-run inflation expectations of households and firms had influenced the evolution of inflation over previous decades; in contrast, the anchoring of inflation expectations in recent years likely had damped somewhat the response of actual inflation to the recent economic downturn and to fluctuations in the prices of energy and other commodities."
110,"In discussing these issues, participants noted that they bear in mind the shocks hitting the economy and regularly monitor more than one measure of resource slack as they assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
111,They also noted the importance of formulating monetary policy in ways that would work well across a range of possible economic structures rather than relying on any one analytical framework.
112,"Finally, they underscored the importance of keeping longer-run inflation expectations firmly anchored to help achieve the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
