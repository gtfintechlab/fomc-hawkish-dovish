0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic situation and outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"The information reviewed at this meeting provided evidence that economic activity, which had expanded at an appreciably lower pace since midyear, might have slowed further in recent months."
2,"Manufacturing production had declined as a consequence, and the rate of expansion in employment had moderated further."
3,"Evidence on core price inflation was mixed; by one measure, it appeared to be increasing very gradually, in part reflecting the indirect effects of higher energy costs, but by another it had remained at a relatively subdued level."
4,Growth in private nonfarm payroll employment moderated a little further on balance in October and November.
5,"With growth in the demand for labor slowing, initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to trend upward, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 4 percent in November, its average thus far this year."
6,"Although the production of high-tech equipment was still trending up, growth continued to slow from the extraordinarily rapid increases of earlier in the year."
7,"Consumer spending appeared to be decelerating noticeably further in the fourth quarter in an environment of diminished consumer confidence, smaller job gains, and lower stock prices."
8,"Retail sales were down somewhat on balance in October and November after a substantial third-quarter increase; sales of light vehicles dropped over the two months, and growth in expenditures on other consumer goods slowed."
9,"Against the backdrop of declining interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages, residential building activity had leveled out since midyear, and October starts remained at the third-quarter level."
10,The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services reached a new record high in September and on a quarterly average basis was up appreciably further in the third quarter.
11,"Economic growth in the foreign industrial countries slowed moderately in the third quarter, and the available information suggested a further reduction in the fourth quarter."
12,"Economic expansion eased in the euro area despite continued strong growth of investment and exports, as consumer spending appeared to be damped by earlier interest rate increases and by the drain on spendable income of higher prices for oil and imported goods more generally."
13,"In addition, weak consumption appeared to be an important factor in continued sluggish economic growth in Japan."
14,"Incoming data indicated that, on balance, price inflation had picked up only a little, if at all."
15,"Consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) on a total and a core basis, rose mildly in October and November after a sizable September increase, but on a year-over-year basis core CPI prices increased noticeably more in the twelve months ended in November than in the previous twelve-month period."
16,"When measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type index, however, consumer price inflation was modest in both October (latest data) and the twelve months ended in October, with little change year over year."
17,"At the producer level, core prices edged down on balance in October and November; moreover, producer inflation eased somewhat on a year-over-year basis, though the deceleration was more than accounted for by an earlier surge in tobacco prices during the year ended in November 1999."
18,"In taking that action, the members noted that despite clear indications of a more moderate expansion in economic activity, persisting risks of heightened inflation pressures remained a concern, particularly in the context of a gradual upward trend in core inflation."
19,"In these circumstances, a steady monetary policy was the best means to promote price stability and sustainable economic expansion."
20,"While recognizing that growth was slowing more than had been anticipated and that developments might be moving in a direction that would require a shift to a balanced risk statement, members agreed that such a change would be premature."
21,"As a result, they agreed that the statement accompanying the announcement of their decision should continue to indicate that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation."
22,"Against the background of deteriorating conditions in some segments of financial markets, slower economic expansion, and public comments by Federal Reserve officials about the implications of those developments, market expectations about the future course of the federal funds rate were revised down appreciably over the intermeeting period, and market interest rates on Treasury and private investment-grade securities declined somewhat over the intermeeting interval."
23,"The weaker outlook for economic growth, coupled with growing market concerns about corporate earnings, weighed down equity prices and boosted risk spreads on lower-rated investment-grade and high-yield bonds."
24,"Equity prices were quite volatile during the intermeeting period and, reflecting numerous dour reports on corporate earnings and incoming information indicating slower growth in economic activity in the United States, broad indexes of stock market prices dropped considerably on balance over the intermeeting period."
25,The slowing growth of M2 in October and November following strong expansion in August and September apparently reflected the moderating rates of increase in nominal income and spending in recent months and perhaps some persisting effects of the rise in opportunity costs earlier in the year.
26,"M3 growth slowed less than that of M2 in November, in part because of stepped-up issuance of large time deposits as banks reduced their reliance on funding from overseas offices."
27,"The growth of domestic nonfinancial debt slowed in October (latest data), reflecting a larger further paydown of federal debt and a reduced pace of private borrowing."
28,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion had slowed considerably, to a rate somewhat below the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output, but that it would gradually gain strength over the next two years."
29,The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the diminishing influence of the wealth effects associated with past outsized gains in equity prices but also by the relatively high interest rates and the somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions.
30,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that in recent quarters, and housing demand to be slightly weaker."
31,"Business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to remain relatively robust; growth abroad would support the expansion of U. S. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to continue its moderate expansionary trend."
32,"Core price inflation was projected to rise only slightly over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher import prices but also as a consequence of some further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by the expected growth of productivity."
33,"The deceleration in the economy had occurred from an unsustainably high growth rate in the first half of the year, and the resulting containment in demand pressures on resources already had improved the outlook for inflation."
34,"While the former still seemed to be the most likely outcome, the very recent information on labor markets, sales and production, business and consumer confidence, developments in financial markets, and growth in foreign economies suggested that the risks to the economy had shifted rapidly and perceptibly to the downside."
35,"Concerning the outlook for inflation, members commented that the upside risks clearly had diminished in the wake of recent developments and that, with pressures on resources likely to abate at least a little, subdued inflation was a reasonable prospect."
36,Weakening trends in production and employment were most apparent in the manufacturing sector.
37,"There were widespread anecdotal reports of production cutbacks, notably in industries related to motor vehicles, and of associated declines in manufacturing employment."
38,"However, many of the factory workers losing their jobs were readily finding employment elsewhere in what generally continued to be characterized as very tight labor markets across the country."
39,"In the aggregate, cutbacks in inventory investment or runoffs of existing inventories accounted for a significant part of the recent moderation in the growth of the overall economy."
40,"The slowing in the growth of consumer spending that had prompted much of the backup in inventories was evident from a wide variety of information, including anecdotal reports from various parts of the country."
41,"Factors cited to account for the relatively sudden emergence of this weakness, and also as possible harbingers of developments in coming quarters, were the negative wealth effects of further declines in stock market prices, the impact of very high energy costs on disposable incomes, and some increase in caution about the outlook for employment opportunities and incomes."
42,"The extent to which such developments would persist and perhaps foster more aggressive retrenchment in consumer spending clearly was uncertain, but the members nonetheless anticipated that over time underlying employment and income trends would be consistent with further expansion in consumer expenditures, though at a pace well below that of earlier in the year."
43,The slowdown reflected a mix of interrelated developments including flagging growth in demand and tightening financial conditions in the form of declining equity prices and stricter credit terms for many business borrowers.
44,"The profitability of using and producing such software and equipment had been overestimated to a degree, and disappointing sales and a better appreciation of risks had resulted in much slower growth in production of such equipment and sharp deterioration in the equity prices of high-tech companies."
45,"Against this background, risks of further retrenchment in capital spending persisted, but to date there was no evidence to suggest that the underlying pace of advances in technology and related productivity growth had abated."
46,"Over time, further increases in productivity would undergird continuing growth in demand for high-tech equipment."
47,"Housing demand was, of course, responding to many of the same factors that were affecting consumer spending, including the negative wealth effects of declining stock market prices."
48,"On the positive side, further growth in incomes and declines in mortgage rates were key elements of underlying strength for the housing sector."
49,"On balance, housing construction at a pace near current levels appeared to be a reasonable prospect in association with forecasts of moderate growth in the overall economy."
50,"Growth in foreign economic activity likely would continue to foster expansion in U. S. exports, though members noted that there were signs of softer business conditions in some foreign nations."
51,"Against the backdrop of slowing economic growth, core inflation had remained quiescent."
52,"Views regarding the outlook for inflation were somewhat mixed, though all the members agreed that the risks of higher inflation had diminished materially."
53,"In such circumstances, if structural productivity growth leveled out, worker efforts to catch up to past increases in productivity could put pressures on labor compensation costs."
54,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.
55,Further depreciation of the dollar in relation to major foreign currencies would add to import prices and domestic inflation pressures.
56,But there were also a number of reasons for optimism about the outlook for consumer prices over coming quarters.
57,"Growth in economic activity at a pace somewhat below that of the economy's output potential would lessen pressures on labor and other resources from levels that had, in the past few years, been associated with at most a small uptick in core inflation."
58,Indications that rapid growth in structural productivity would persist and widespread reports that strong competitive pressures in most markets continued to inhibit business efforts to increase prices in the face of rising costs also were favorable factors in the outlook.
59,"Further declines in oil prices, as evidenced by quotations in futures markets, would if realized have effects not only on so-called headline inflation but would help hold down core prices over time."
60,"Despite previous increases in headline inflation, survey and other measures of inflation expectations continued to suggest that long-run inflation expectations had not risen and might even have fallen a bit of late as the economy softened."
61,"In their evaluation of the appropriate policy for these changing circumstances, the members agreed that the critical issue was whether the expansion would stabilize near its recent growth rate or was continuing to slow."
62,"Much of the usual aggregative data on spending and employment, although to be sure available only with a lag, continued to suggest moderate economic expansion."
63,"As a consequence, most of the members were persuaded that a prudent policy course would be to await further confirmation of a weakening expansion before easing, particularly in light of the high level of resource utilization and the experience of recent years when several lulls in the growth of the economy had been followed by a resumption of very robust economic expansion."
64,"Additional evidence of slowing economic growth might well materialize in the weeks immediately ahead--from the regular aggregated monthly data releases, but also from weekly readings on the labor market and reports from businesses on the strength of sales and production--and the members agreed that the Committee should be prepared to respond promptly to indications of further weakness in the economy."
65,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action."
66,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers."
67,"The revised statement of risks, even though it would not be associated with an easing move, could strengthen expectations regarding future monetary policy easing to an extent that was difficult to predict and could generate sizable reactions in financial markets."
68,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
69,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
