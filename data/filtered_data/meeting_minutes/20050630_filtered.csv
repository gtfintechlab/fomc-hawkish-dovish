0,At this meeting the Committee reviewed and discussed staff presentations on the topic of housing valuations and monetary policy.
1,"In addition to local market factors, a wide range of influences appeared to be supporting home prices, including solid gains in disposable income, low mortgage rates, and financial innovation in the residential mortgage market."
2,"Meeting participants noted that the rise in house prices had been accompanied by a modest shift toward potentially riskier types of mortgages, including adjustable-rate and interest-only loans, which could pose challenges to both lenders and borrowers."
3,"Housing activity remained at a high level, business investment appeared to have improved some after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter, and manufacturing picked up notably in May."
4,"Labor demand continued to expand, and the unemployment rate edged down further in May."
5,"Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May, but crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in the spring."
6,"Averaging through a large gain in April and a more modest increase in May, growth in payroll employment was on par with that over the preceding six months."
7,The unemployment rate dipped to 5.
8,Survey indicators and the continued relatively low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance also supported the notion of continued improvement in the labor market.
9,"Recent measures of consumer confidence improved from their levels earlier in the spring, when higher gasoline prices and concerns about a slowing in the pace of the economic expansion may have served as restraining influences."
10,"While prices of existing homes continued to increase rapidly, new home prices showed signs of decelerating."
11,"After reaching a record high relative to GDP in February, the U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in March, but widened again in April."
12,"GDP growth in most major foreign industrial economies picked up slightly in the first quarter, but recent economic indicators for the major foreign economies in the second quarter were mixed."
13,Consumer prices were about unchanged in May after posting large increases in the previous few months.
14,"Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed part of their earlier run-up."
15,"Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared to have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year."
16,"Despite this moderation, measures of core consumer price inflation over the past year were somewhat above those for the comparable period a year ago."
17,"The producer price index rose sharply in April, but dropped back again in May, driven largely by a swing in the food and energy components."
18,"According to recent surveys, both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations had changed little over the past two months, and market measures of inflation compensation had moved lower."
19,"With regard to labor costs, growth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector in the first quarter was estimated to have slowed some after advancing notably in the fourth quarter; the first quarter increase was broadly similar to those posted during the middle of last year."
20,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
21,"The Committee also noted that recent data suggested that the solid pace of spending growth had slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices, but that labor market conditions apparently continued to improve gradually."
22,"While pressures on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power was more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained."
23,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
24,"The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and to retain the ""measured pace"" language was widely expected in financial markets."
25,"Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates and largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably over the intermeeting period."
26,"Bank credit decelerated sharply in April and May from rapid gains posted in the first quarter, as growth in both securities and loans fell."
27,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.
28,A slightly larger portion of domestic demand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period.
29,"The forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices, and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane."
30,"The economy evidently had been resilient in the face of rising energy prices, and financial conditions remained accommodative, supporting growth going forward."
31,"Increases in core consumer prices had slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices."
32,"However, the impetus to inflation from the prices of oil and other commodities was expected to wane, and long-term inflation expectations apparently remained well-anchored."
33,"With some limited remaining slack in labor markets likely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of policy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained."
34,"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2005 and 2006."
35,These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate of 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and a rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
36,"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, were mainly near the middle of a 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent range this year and somewhat below the middle of a range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent next year."
37,"With rising home and equity prices buoying household wealth, consumer expenditures continued to advance."
38,"Although the recent surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time, consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going forward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets."
39,"Increased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some parts of the country, but robust demand for new homes owed in large part to the ongoing economic expansion and low long-term interest rates."
40,"Business outlays for capital goods continued to rise, and the outlook for investment spending remained solid, supported by increased sales, low interest rates, robust profits, and strong business balance sheets."
41,Large federal budget deficits were expected to persist despite an increase in tax receipts in recent months.
42,"These deficits were contributing to a low level of national saving that would, if not corrected over time, ultimately constrain investment and overall economic growth."
43,"Moreover, U. S. trade deficits were expected to remain large going forward, reflecting both the low level of U. S. saving and relatively slow growth in some of our trading partners."
44,"In their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants' comments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest rates and the continued run-up in home prices."
45,"Lower compensation for inflation accounted for a portion of the decline in longer-term nominal yields, but a larger portion reflected reductions in real yields."
46,"For one, investors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen as likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line with potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative to saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U. S. growth."
47,"However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with higher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets."
48,The behavior of long-term interest rates could also reflect reduced uncertainty on the part of investors about the economic outlook -- as seen in low readings of implied volatility in bond and equity markets.
49,"Finally, demands for longer-term U. S. securities by both domestic and foreign investors might have been boosted by special factors."
50,Confidence about the economic outlook and low market interest rates--along with possibly outsized expectations of capital gains in some markets--could also help to account for the high level of home prices the Committee had discussed on the first day of the meeting.
51,It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook for both long-term interest rates and home prices.
52,"With regard to any role for monetary policy in responding to possible imbalances in housing or bond markets, meeting participants stressed the importance of the pursuit of their core objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth."
53,"To the extent that an asset price movement threatened the achievement of those objectives, it would of course be taken into consideration in setting policy."
54,"However, given the unavoidable uncertainties associated with judgments regarding the appropriate level of and likely future movements in asset prices, a strategy of responding more directly to possible mispricing was seen as very unlikely to contribute, on balance, to the achievement of the Committee's objectives over time."
55,Participants' views on the inflation outlook were mixed.
56,"Thus far in 2005, core consumer price inflation had been higher than most participants had expected at the start of the year, reflecting, at least in part, the pass-through effects of higher energy, commodity, and import prices."
57,"While such shocks could be expected to boost inflation temporarily, some participants expressed concern that, with policy still accommodative, the underlying pace of inflation might be in the process of stepping up, perhaps to a level that was at the upper end of the range that they viewed as compatible with the Committee's price stability objective."
58,"Trend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural productivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants thought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back in coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years."
59,"And with higher energy prices already eating into profit margins at firms outside the energy sector, increases in unit labor costs might be more likely to be passed through into prices."
60,"While agreeing that inflation developments had to be watched carefully, other meeting participants emphasized that recent core inflation data had been relatively restrained, and anecdotal reports suggested that pricing power at many firms remained quite limited."
61,"Moreover, readings from futures markets suggested that oil prices would likely flatten out, so their effect on inflation should gradually ebb."
62,"Similarly, prices of other commodities and imports, which had surged for a time, were now moderating."
63,Survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist.
64,"Finally, while the degree of slack in labor markets was uncertain, total labor compensation had probably been boosted temporarily around the turn of the year by special factors, and the recent behavior of a range of other indicators of labor costs appeared consistent with some remaining slack that would likely tend to restrain inflation pressures."
65,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, all members agreed on a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate to 3-1/4 percent."
66,"Economic growth remained firm, while rising energy, and possibly labor, costs threatened to put upward pressure on inflation."
67,"Even with this action, the federal funds rate remained below the level members anticipated would prove necessary in the long run to contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential."
68,"In considering the statement to be released following this meeting, members concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices, the expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually."
69,"All also thought that the statement should note the continued pressures on inflation, while mentioning that long-term inflation expectations remained well contained."
70,"With policy still seen as accommodative, members agreed that the statement should retain an assessment that the risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced, conditional on appropriate policy action."
71,"The members concurred that at this stage in the expansion, with margins of slack resources narrowing and inflation somewhat higher, the Committee needed to be particularly alert to signs of a further increase in inflation."
72,Such an increase could be particularly problematic because it might impart upward momentum to inflation expectations that would be costly to reverse.
73,"In any case, additional tightening would probably be necessary, but views differed on the amount of tightening that would likely be required to keep inflation contained and bring output in line with potential."
74,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
75,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal."
76,"With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
77,"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. """
