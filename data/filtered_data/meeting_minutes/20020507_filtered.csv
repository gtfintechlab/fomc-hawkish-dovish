0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity expanded rapidly early in the year.
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.
3,The demand for labor began to firm in April.
4,Available information suggested that labor productivity had risen substantially in the first quarter.
5,"Although the recent surge in energy prices boosted headline consumer inflation in the first quarter, core measures of inflation had trended lower over the past year."
6,Private nonfarm payroll employment turned up in April after having posted small declines in February and March and steep reductions earlier.
7,"In addition, layoffs continued to slow in the manufacturing sector, and some industries recorded their first solid advances in employment in more than a year."
8,"Despite the pickup in private payrolls, the unemployment rate rose to 6."
9,"0 percent in April, perhaps reflecting to an important extent the incentives created by the new federal program of extended unemployment benefits for some jobless workers to continue, or resume, looking for work."
10,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened in January and February, reflecting a considerably larger expansion in the value of imports than in that of exports."
11,"With regard to economic activity abroad, the available information indicated that, on balance, foreign economic output had rebounded in the first quarter."
12,"The Canadian economy appeared to have expanded robustly in the first quarter, and economic activity in Europe evidently had turned upward."
13,"Although higher energy prices continued to push up headline consumer price inflation in March, inflation had moved downward over the past twelve months."
14,Both the overall consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-linked index decelerated significantly over the past year.
15,"Moreover, excluding their volatile food and energy components, both measures of inflation also fell over the past year."
16,"At the producer level, prices for finished goods echoed the pattern of consumer prices: Both total and core finished goods inflation decelerated on a year-over-year basis."
17,"Labor cost growth, as measured by hourly compensation in private industry, also appeared to have slowed a bit over the latest twelve-month period."
18,Members noted that the impetus for the economic advance was to a large extent a temporary swing in inventory investment rather than a clear and substantial upswing in final demand.
19,"The members contemplated, however, that the stance of monetary policy would have to become less accommodative once clearer evidence emerged that a healthy expansion was firmly established."
20,"However, doubts about the strength of the recovery owing to the tone of the Committee's press statement along with mixed incoming data on final demand, announcements of weaker-than-expected corporate earnings, and heightening tensions in the Middle East prompted declines in yields on short- to intermediate-term Treasury securities."
21,Most major indexes of equity prices moved down sharply in response to the outlook for a weaker economic recovery and the adverse implications for corporate profits of economic and other developments.
22,"The declines evidently reflected in part the rising opportunity costs of holding M2 assets as yields on the components of M2 declined in lagged response to the earlier easing of monetary policy and fostered transfers out of M2 funds, especially from retail money market funds to stock and bond mutual funds."
23,Reduced demand for mortgage refinancing and lower nonwithheld federal payments also contributed importantly to the weakness in the broad monetary aggregates.
24,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity was slowing substantially in the current quarter but would pick up in the second half of the year and continue at a moderate pace next year.
25,"An emerging shift by businesses from inventory liquidation to some replenishment of stocks would help boost activity over the next several quarters, but the ongoing recovery would depend increasingly on growth in spending by households and businesses."
26,"Such spending would be fostered by the monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and abetted by vigorous anticipated growth in structural productivity, which would support household incomes and business investment incentives."
27,"With a relatively robust contour for the course of final sales over the forecast horizon, the pressure on resources would rise somewhat despite the anticipated higher growth of structural productivity."
28,"Nonetheless, activity would remain below the economy's potential for a period ahead and the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to contribute to damped core consumer price inflation."
29,How much final demand would strengthen going forward was still uncertain.
30,"A pause in the expansion was not an unusual development during the early stages of a cyclical recovery, and the members generally viewed a pickup in growth as a reasonable expectation."
31,"The currently stimulative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy would tend to undergird final demand, especially in the context of an economy that had exhibited a marked degree of resilience and strength in underlying productivity growth that would bolster household incomes and provide incentives for business capital spending."
32,"Members noted, however, that an already high level of consumer spending pointed to more limited than usual scope for further growth in such spending, and gloomy business sentiment in the face of disappointing sales and profits raised a question about the extent to which business investment would help to lift final demand over coming quarters."
33,"Given growth in economic activity broadly in line with current expectations, inflation was likely to remain benign for some time in the context of an apparently strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, excess capacity in many labor and product markets, and a related absence of pricing power in generally very competitive markets."
34,"Looking ahead, some growth in overall consumer spending appeared likely in association with the now more firmly entrenched economic expansion."
35,"On the upside, faster-than-anticipated growth could well materialize in an environment of monetary and fiscal policy ease and of gradually firming labor markets and rising productivity that would be boosting income growth."
36,"On the other hand, employment growth had been very sluggish to date, with employers remaining quite cautious in their hiring practices, and continued softness in labor markets could damp consumer confidence."
37,The run-up in energy prices also was a negative for household purchasing power.
38,"Household expenditures on new homes were likewise at an elevated level, although members reported weakness in some price segments and geographic areas of the housing market."
39,"In general, however, housing displayed ongoing strength in response to low mortgage rates, with rising prices in many areas, and the downside risks to this sector of the economy appeared to be limited."
40,"At the same time, members anticipated that growth, if any, in homebuilding activity would be subdued over the next several quarters after an extended period of strong expansion."
41,"Accordingly, much of their current investment spending was focused on cost-saving equipment and software in an effort to bolster profits in a stable-price environment that made it difficult to pass on rising costs."
42,The markedly reduced pace of inventory liquidation in the first quarter of the year accounted for much of the step-up in GDP growth in that quarter and provided a strong indication that the period of inventory liquidation under way for more than a year probably was coming to an end.
43,"A shift to inventory stocking in the near term, possibly in the current quarter, was seen as a reasonable expectation, but with numerous firms having already moved production into closer alignment with sales, members anticipated much less impetus to overall economic activity from inventories over coming quarters."
44,"Although foreign economic activity appeared to be picking up to some extent and the dollar had edged lower, net exports were expected to remain a negative factor in the growth of the domestic economy."
45,"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon."
46,The outlook for inflation remained favorable.
47,"Nearly all measures of total and core prices had decelerated over the past year, and in the context of forecasts implying a continued sizable gap between actual and potential output, the risk that inflationary pressures would intensify significantly over coming quarters appeared to be quite limited; indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion."
48,"The deceleration in labor costs over the past several quarters, evidence of a surprisingly strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, low and stable inflation expectations, and the widespread absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets were signs that upside inflation risks in the period ahead were relatively small."
49,"These included significant increases in energy costs in recent months, evidence of an upturn in some industrial prices, sharp increases in many insurance costs, continuing upward pressures on medical costs, and modest recent declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
50,"With the stance of monetary policy currently quite accommodative, the members saw the need for careful monitoring of the potential for rising inflation pressures as the economic recovery gained momentum."
51,The members recognized that monetary policy exerted its effects with a considerable lag and that the current stance of policy probably was inconsistent with the Committee's inflation objective over time.
52,"However, current inflation pressures were subdued and were expected to remain so for a considerable period, thereby providing adequate opportunity to evaluate ongoing developments and tighten policy as needed later."
53,"Against the longer-term inflation risks inherent in the current stance of policy, the members weighed the possibility that the expansion could be relatively subdued for a time, damping prices further and failing to reduce margins of underutilized resources."
54,"In any event, a neutral statement regarding the risks to the economy in the foreseeable future would not preclude a preemptive tightening adjustment in the stance of policy stance should new evidence bearing on the strength of the expansion and the outlook for inflation warrant such a policy move."
55,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
56,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future."
