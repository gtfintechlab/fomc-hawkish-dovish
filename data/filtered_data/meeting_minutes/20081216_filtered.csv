0,The information reviewed at the December meeting pointed to a significant contraction in economic activity in the fourth quarter.
1,"Private payrolls continued to fall at a faster pace than earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate rose to 6."
2,"The housing market weakened again as construction activity, new home sales, and home prices declined further."
3,"Financial markets saw a further pullback in risk-taking, spurred in part by the more pessimistic outlook for economic activity; this situation led to lower equity prices, higher risk spreads, and tighter constraints in credit markets, all of which intensified the decline in real activity."
4,"On the inflation front, headline consumer prices declined in recent months, as energy prices continued to fall and consumer food price increases moderated."
5,"According to the November employment report, payroll employment fell at a rapid pace over the preceding three months, with substantial losses across a wide range of industry groups, including manufacturing, construction, retail, financial activities, and business services."
6,The unemployment rate climbed to 6.
7,New claims for unemployment insurance rose sharply through early December.
8,Preliminary data for October and November suggested that overall fourth-quarter real spending would receive a modest boost from recent price declines for gasoline.
9,"Real incomes were also boosted by the reversal in energy prices, though the negative wealth effects of continued declines in equity and house prices likely offset this somewhat."
10,"Housing demand remained weak, and although the number of unsold new single-family homes continued to move lower, inventories remained elevated relative to the current pace of sales."
11,Several indexes indicated that house prices continued to decline substantially.
12,"Investment demand seemed to be weighed down by weak fundamentals and increased uncertainty about the state of the economy, while prospects for future investment activity reflected in surveys of business conditions and sentiment worsened in recent months."
13,"The U. S. international trade deficit widened in October, as a fall in imports was more than offset by a significant decline in exports."
14,"Much of the decline in exports was the result of drops in agricultural goods and industrial supplies, which largely reflected a decrease in the prices of these goods."
15,"In the euro area and the United Kingdom, purchasing managers indexes fell in November to levels associated with severe contractions in economic activity."
16,"Labor market conditions in the advanced economies deteriorated further, with most countries experiencing rising unemployment rates."
17,"In Japan, real GDP fell in the third quarter as domestic demand declined and private investment fell for the second consecutive quarter."
18,"After peaking in the third quarter, consumer price inflation moderated in all advanced foreign economies, primarily as a result of falling energy and food prices."
19,"Headline inflation generally declined across emerging market economies, primarily because of lower food and energy prices and, in some cases, weaker economic activity."
20,"In the United States, headline consumer prices declined in recent months while core consumer price inflation slowed further."
21,"With energy prices falling sharply and the rate of increase in food prices moderating, headline PCE prices fell in October, and data from the consumer price index (CPI) indicated that the decline extended into November."
22,"Core PCE prices were unchanged in October, and based on the CPI, appeared to have been unchanged again in November."
23,"The recent slowing in core consumer price inflation was widespread and likely reflected not only the weak pace of economic activity but also the easing of some earlier cost pressures as the prices of crude oil, gasoline, and other commodities declined."
24,"Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose modestly again in November, as prices at earlier stages of processing continued to retreat for the third consecutive month."
25,Measures of inflation expectations continued to fall or hold steady during the intermeeting period.
26,"The Committee's statement noted that economic activity appeared to have slowed markedly, due importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures."
27,"Business equipment spending and industrial production had weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies was damping the prospects for U. S. exports."
28,"The Committee noted that, in light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, it expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability."
29,"The Committee also noted that recent policy actions, including the rate reduction that was approved at the October 28-29 meeting, coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth."
30,"Nevertheless, downside risks to economic activity remained and the Committee indicated that it would monitor economic and financial developments carefully and act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."
31,"Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down their expectations for the path of monetary policy."
32,"Subsequently, however, the expected future path of monetary policy dropped amid data releases that suggested a weaker outlook for economic activity and lower inflation than had been anticipated, along with continued strains in financial markets that weighed on investor sentiment."
33,Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined significantly over the intermeeting period in response to safe-haven demands as well as the downward revisions in the economic outlook and the expected policy path.
34,"Meanwhile, yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined by smaller amounts, leaving inflation compensation lower."
35,"Although the decline in inflation compensation occurred amid sharp decreases in inflation measures and energy prices, it was likely amplified by increased investor preference for the greater liquidity of nominal Treasury securities relative to that of inflation-protected Treasury securities."
36,"Amid high demand for safe investments, the overnight Treasury general collateral (GC) repo rate remained very low and fell to around zero late in the intermeeting period."
37,"Heavy demand for safe instruments was also apparent in the Treasury bill market, where yields turned negative at times."
38,"In addition, the Treasury Department's announcement that funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program would not be used to purchase securities backed by mortgage-related and other assets appeared to prompt negative price reactions in several financial markets."
39,"Stock prices of financial corporations fell considerably, while broad equity indexes declined, on net, amid high volatility."
40,"The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages declined, which prompted a noticeable increase in mortgage refinancing."
41,Flows into demand deposits covered by the FDIC's new temporary guarantee program were significant and apparently reflected shifts out of savings accounts as well as redirection of funds by banks' customers away from other money market instruments.
42,"Currency continued its strong increase, apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for U. S. banknotes."
43,"Movements in stock prices were mixed in the advanced foreign economies, although equity prices generally rose in emerging market economies."
44,"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply."
45,"Sovereign bond yields fell, reflecting prospects for lower inflation and lower policy rates for an extended period."
46,"In the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff revised down sharply its outlook for economic activity in 2009 but continued to project a moderate recovery in 2010."
47,"Rising unemployment, the declines in stock market wealth, low levels of consumer sentiment, weakened household balance sheets, and restrictive credit conditions were likely to continue to hinder household spending over the near term."
48,"Oil prices, which dropped significantly during the intermeeting period, were assumed to rise over the next two years in line with the path indicated by futures market prices, but to remain below the levels of October 2008."
49,Real GDP was projected to decline for 2009 as a whole and to rise at a pace slightly above the rate of potential growth in 2010.
50,"Amid the weaker outlook for economic activity over the next year, the unemployment rate was likely to rise significantly into 2010, to a level higher than projected at the time of the October 28-29 FOMC meeting."
51,"The disinflationary effects of increased slack in resource utilization, diminished pressures from energy and materials prices, declines in import prices, and further moderate reductions in inflation expectations caused the staff to reduce its forecast for both core and overall PCE inflation."
52,Core inflation was projected to slow considerably in 2009 and then to edge down further in 2010.
53,"Credit conditions continued to tighten for both households and businesses, and ongoing declines in equity prices further reduced household wealth."
54,Conditions in the housing market weakened again and house prices declined further.
55,Employment and production indicators weakened further as businesses responded very rapidly to the fall-off in demand.
56,Participants expected economic activity to contract sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in early 2009.
57,"Most projected that the economy would begin to recover slowly in the second half of 2009, aided by substantial monetary policy easing and by anticipated fiscal stimulus."
58,Meeting participants generally agreed that the uncertainty surrounding the outlook was considerable and that downside risks to even this weak trajectory for economic activity were a serious concern.
59,Inflation pressures had diminished appreciably as energy and other commodity prices dropped and economic activity slumped.
60,"Looking forward, participants agreed that inflationary pressures looked set to moderate further in coming quarters, reflecting recent declines in commodity prices and rising slack in resource markets, and several saw risks that inflation could drop for a time below rates they viewed as most consistent over time with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
61,Meeting participants observed that financial strains continued to exert a powerful drag on economic activity and that the adverse feedback loop between financial conditions and economic performance had intensified.
62,"Equity prices continued to drop amid high volatility, further reducing household wealth."
63,"The sharp drops and unusual volatility in the prices of many financial assets since the beginning of the fourth quarter were likely to cause more losses for financial institutions, and a number of participants noted that loan delinquencies were increasing significantly in the consumer sector, adding to pressures on banks' balance sheets and reinforcing banks' cautious lending stance."
64,"Participants observed that the effects of the financial turmoil, increased uncertainty, and drops in confidence and demand were becoming increasingly evident in the business sector."
65,"Even sectors that had performed relatively well until recently, such as mining and drilling, were experiencing reduced activity, mostly due to the decline in commodity prices."
66,"Business sentiment had deteriorated sharply since September, likely contributing to steep drops in employment and production."
67,"Many participants noted that the decline in household wealth resulting from large drops in equity and house prices, together with tighter credit conditions, rapidly increasing unemployment, and deteriorating consumer sentiment, was contributing to a sharp contraction in consumer spending."
68,"Some participants pointed out that reduced consumer wealth and concerns about employment could lead to a further increase in saving, which, although desirable in the longer term, could put additional downward pressure on consumer spending in coming quarters."
69,"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain."
70,"As a consequence, demand for U. S. exports had weakened, held back also by the strengthening of the dollar since the summer."
71,"Going forward, global demand was expected to remain weak, and thus growth in exports was unlikely to provide much support for U. S. activity."
72,"However, the weakness in the global economy was contributing to lower prices of energy and other commodities, which should boost real incomes and provide modest support to household spending."
73,Participants agreed that falling prices for energy and other commodities and diminished economic activity had resulted in an appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures.
74,Participants were uncertain about the extent to which inflation would fall.
75,"Some saw inflation leveling out near desired levels, while others expressed concern that inflation might decline below levels consistent with price stability in the medium term."
76,Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations were an important determinant of future price dynamics.
77,"However, some survey evidence suggested that firms expected prices to continue to decline as they had over the previous few months."
78,Several participants observed that monitoring measures of inflation expectations for signs of disinflationary dynamics would be especially important going forward.
79,"In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors, meeting participants discussed extensively how in current circumstances the Committee could best support the resumption of sustainable economic growth and promote the maintenance of price stability over the medium term."
80,"Participants noted that very low levels of the federal funds rate had the potential to help buoy aggregate demand and economic activity, but they also had potential costs in terms of the functioning of certain financial markets and some financial institutions."
81,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely."
82,Another possible form of communication that participants discussed was a more explicit indication of their views on what longer-run rate of inflation would best promote their goals of maximum employment and price stability.
83,"The added clarity in that regard might help forestall the development of expectations that inflation would decline below desired levels, and hence keep real interest rates low and support aggregate demand."
84,Meeting participants also discussed how best to employ the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to promote monetary policy goals.
85,Participants also generally believed that the special liquidity and lending facilities implemented or announced recently would support the availability of credit to businesses and households and thus help sustain economic activity.
86,"Participants emphasized that the ultimate objective of special lending facilities and asset purchases was to support overall market functioning, financial intermediation, and economic growth."
87,"However, they also recognized that, as economic activity recovered and financial conditions normalized, the use of certain policy tools would need to be scaled back, the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves would need to be reduced, and the Committee's policy framework would return to focus on the level of the federal funds rate."
88,"A number of participants observed that, under the approach of conducting monetary policy by acquiring a variety of assets as needed to address financial and macroeconomic strains, the quantity of excess reserves and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would be determined by the Federal Reserve's asset purchases and the usage of its lending facilities."
89,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves."
90,"Going forward, consideration will be given to whether various quantitative measures would be useful in calibrating and communicating the stance of monetary policy."
91,"In the discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members recognized that the large volume of excess reserves had already resulted in federal funds rates significantly below the target federal funds rate and the interest rate on excess reserves."
92,They agreed that maintaining a low level of short-term interest rates and relying on the use of balance sheet policies and communications about monetary policy would be effective and appropriate in light of the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook and the appreciable easing of inflationary pressures.
93,"Even with the additional use of nontraditional policies, the economic outlook would remain weak for a time and the downside risks to economic activity would be substantial."
94,"Moreover, inflation would continue to fall, reflecting both the drop in commodity prices that had already occurred and the buildup of economic slack; indeed some members saw significant risks that inflation could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels."
95,Members debated how best to communicate their decisions regarding monetary policy actions.
96,"Indeed, those members felt that lack of an explicit target could be helpful, in that it would focus attention on the shift in the policy framework from targeting the federal funds rate to the use of balance sheet policies and communications about monetary policy as a way of providing further monetary stimulus."
97,A few members stressed that the absence of an explicit federal funds rate target would give banks added flexibility in pricing loans and deposits in the current environment of unusually low interest rates.
98,"However, other members noted that not announcing a target might confuse market participants and lead investors to believe that the Federal Reserve was unable to control the federal funds rate when it could, in fact, still influence the effective federal funds rate through adjustments of the interest rate on excess reserves and the primary credit rate."
99,The members emphasized that their expectation about the path of the federal funds rate was conditioned on their view of the likely path of economic activity.
100,Members agreed that the statement should indicate that all available tools would be employed to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.
101,"In light of the use of additional tools for implementing monetary policy, the Committee revised the form of the directive to the Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
102,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
103,"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
104,"Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further."
105,"Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably."
106,"In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters."
107,The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.
108,"The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity. """
109,"The Committee also continued its discussion of possible refinements to the Committee's approach to projections that could provide additional information about participants' views of longer-run sustainable rates of economic growth and unemployment and the measured rates of inflation that would be consistent with price stability, but it made no decisions regarding these issues."
