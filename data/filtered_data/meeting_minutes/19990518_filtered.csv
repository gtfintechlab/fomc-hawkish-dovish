0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to expand vigorously.
2,The expansion in industrial production had quickened recently while gains in employment had moderated somewhat.
3,"Inflation had remained low, although consumer prices registered a sizable rise in April; labor costs were still quiescent despite very tight labor markets."
4,"Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed on balance over March and April, but hiring was still relatively rapid."
5,"By contrast, manufacturing experienced further job losses, and construction employment fell on balance over the March-April period after having expanded briskly since last fall."
6,"The civilian unemployment rate in April, at 4."
7,Industrial production increased substantially in March and April after a period of sluggish growth.
8,"Although growth in the output of nondurable goods had increased somewhat in recent months, the level of production was still below its year-earlier level."
9,"Consumer spending has been very strong this year, supported by rapid income growth, soaring household net worth, and buoyant consumer sentiment."
10,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly."
11,"Economic growth continued to be sluggish in many of the major foreign industrial countries, according to the limited information available for the first quarter."
12,"Elsewhere, the Korean economy grew vigorously in the first quarter, and there were indications that the slowdown in economic activity in Southeast Asia and Latin America might have bottomed out, with some countries beginning to recover."
13,Consumer prices rose substantially in April.
14,"Energy prices increased sharply, food prices edged up, and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy rose appreciably."
15,"For the twelve months ended in April, core consumer inflation was slightly higher than for the year-earlier period."
16,"Producer prices of finished goods also increased in April, but by less than consumer prices."
17,"Finished energy prices were up sharply, but prices of finished foods declined appreciably, and prices of core producer goods advanced only slightly."
18,"For the twelve months ended in April, core producer inflation was up noticeably over that for the year-earlier period, reflecting importantly the sharp increase in prices of tobacco products."
19,"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent."
20,"The Committee judged this policy stance to be consistent with its objectives of fostering high employment and sustained low inflation, with the risks of different outcomes being reasonably well balanced, at least for the near term."
21,The climb in rates reflected not only the strength of incoming data on the U. S. economy but also improved economic prospects in many foreign countries and higher world commodity prices.
22,Most key measures of share prices in equity markets recorded sizable gains over the intermeeting period.
23,"The dollar also depreciated significantly against the Canadian and Australian currencies as the prices of metals, oil, and lumber moved higher."
24,"Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items."
25,"The lagged effects of the rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead."
26,"Labor markets were anticipated to remain tight, and inflation was projected to increase somewhat on balance over the projection period, partly as a result of some firming of import prices that, in turn, would give domestic firms somewhat more leeway to raise their prices."
27,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that they saw few signs of any moderation in the expansion of economic activity from the rapid pace that had prevailed in recent quarters-a pace greater than the growth in the economy's potential, even though the growth of potential was rising as a result of accelerating productivity."
28,"For a number of reasons, they still viewed some slowing in the expansion to a growth rate more in line with that of potential as a reasonable expectation."
29,"And in light of the persistent strength in domestic demand, the reduced risks of economic weakness abroad, and the recovery in U. S. financial markets, most members believed that for the year ahead the odds around their forecasts were tilted toward further robust growth that would add to pressures on already tight labor markets."
30,"The latest statistical and anecdotal information on wages and prices, while somewhat more mixed than earlier, continued on balance to present a picture of benign inflation."
31,"However, the firming of oil and other commodity prices, the more frequent anecdotal reports of increases in some costs and prices, and the most recent CPI statistics could be read as suggesting at least that the trend toward lower inflation was coming to an end and perhaps also as harbingers of a less favorable inflation performance going forward, especially if growth in demand did not slow to a more sustainable pace."
32,"A key uncertainty in the outlook for inflation related to the prospects for productivity, whose continued acceleration over the past several quarters clearly had helped to contain cost pressures despite widespread indications of persistently tight labor markets."
33,"On balance, while an upward trend in underlying inflation had not materialized thus far, the members were concerned that if recent developments continued--especially if demand did not slow to a more sustainable pace--inflation was more likely to rise over time."
34,The impressive strength in private domestic spending during the first several months of the year featured notable gains in consumer and business expenditures and appreciable growth in outlays for residential construction.
35,"Underlying the strength in these key sectors of the economy was the marked improvement in overall financial market conditions since the fall of last year, including the ample availability of financing on relatively favorable terms for many borrowers and the sharp rise in stock market prices."
36,Consumer expenditures were expected to be well maintained in conjunction with projections of appreciable further growth in jobs and incomes and a ready availability of financing.
37,"The very large equity price increases in recent years evidently had contributed to high levels of consumer confidence and robust consumer spending, and the further gains in those prices thus far this year would continue to bolster spending for a while."
38,"A leveling trend in stock market prices, should one materialize, likely would have a significant restraining effect on consumer confidence and the growth of spending over time."
39,"These included the large buildup in equipment over the course of recent years, some moderation in the growth of demand for capital associated with slower expansion of overall spending, and in these circumstances more sluggish growth of business profits."
40,"The behavior of stock market prices also would play a role in the cost of business finance and the level of business confidence, but one that could not readily be predicted."
41,"While these backlogs and continued affordability of home purchases were expected to help sustain residential construction activity near current levels for some period of time, statistical and survey indicators pointed to some loss of momentum in housing sales and new construction, perhaps partly in response to the rise in long-term interest rates."
42,"Foreign trade on net was damping demand pressures on U. S. production capacity, but its negative impact was thought likely to diminish over time."
43,The resulting impetus to exports was projected to be accompanied by a lower rate of growth in imports as the expansion of the U. S. economy slowed.
44,Members expressed concern about what they now saw as a greater risk of rising inflation even though current indicators continued on the whole to point to quiescent wage and price behavior.
45,"The recent performance of the CPI and industrial commodity prices and the more numerous anecdotal reports of price and cost increases were reasons for added caution about the outlook for inflation, though these developments still constituted only very tentative evidence of a possible change in inflation trends."
46,"Unexpectedly large gains in productivity had both contributed to demand and helped output to keep pace with the strong growth in demand, but an important portion of that demand also had been met by drawing down the pool of available workers and by rapid increases in imports."
47,"Inflation expectations, while perhaps deteriorating a bit recently, were still subdued and undoubtedly continued to help account for restrained pricing behavior and for relatively moderate wage demands despite the tightness in labor markets."
48,"Partly because the economy continued to demonstrate a marked ability to absorb large increases in demand without generating significant cost and price pressures, the members did not see a sizable upturn in underlying inflation as a likely prospect over the next few quarters."
49,"In particular, if that pressure intensified, at some point further gains in productivity would not be able to offset rising wage increases."
50,"Moreover, the effect on prices would tend to be exacerbated by the ebbing or reversal of temporary factors that had served to damp inflation; notable among those factors were the upturn in energy prices and the current or prospective firming of commodity and other import prices as economic activity strengthened abroad."
51,"With both the extent of prospective pressures in labor markets and the outlook for productivity subject to considerable uncertainty, a firmer assessment of the future course of inflation needed to await further developments."
52,"Although their concerns about the outlook for inflation had increased significantly since the previous meeting, the members felt that there was still a reasonable chance that the current stance of policy would remain consistent with containing price pressures for some period of time."
53,"Signs of an actual change in inflation were still quite tentative and anecdotal, and they did not warrant an adjustment to policy at this meeting."
54,"Moreover, as the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated, improvements in productivity growth might permit the economy to continue to accommodate strong demand for some time without generating higher inflation, especially if the growth of demand were to moderate somewhat in the months ahead."
55,"In that regard, the prospective strength of demand pressures and related outlook for productivity were subject to a wide range of uncertainty, and there were reasons to believe that economic growth could well slow without any adjustment to policy."
56,"The members recognized that the recovery in credit markets, the rise in equity prices, and the turnaround in some foreign economies could imply that the lower federal funds rate established last fall was no longer entirely appropriate."
57,"However, they concluded that given the prevailing uncertainties in the economic outlook it was preferable to defer any policy action and to monitor the economy closely for further signs that inflationary pressures were likely to rise."
58,"The members nonetheless agreed that their increased concerns about the outlook for inflation called for the adoption of an asymmetric directive that was tilted toward tightening and, in keeping with the Committee's recently reaffirmed policy, to announce that change after this meeting."
59,"The Committee had said that it would not necessarily publish every change in the symmetry of its directive, but this shift to asymmetry represented a significant change in the Committee's assessment of the risks of higher inflation, and its announcement would alert the financial markets and the public more generally to this development."
60,"It was important that the public, including those who participated in financial markets, understood the Committee's resolve to keep inflation at a low level."
61,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued vigorous expansion in economic activity."
62,"Nonfarm payroll employment moderated on balance over March and April, and the civilian unemployment rate in April matched its first-quarter average."
63,Available indicators suggest that growth of business capital spending has remained relatively rapid.
64,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average.
65,"Consumer prices rose substantially in April, boosted by a sharp increase in energy prices; labor costs have remained quiescent thus far this year despite very tight labor markets."
66,Most key measures of share prices in equity markets have registered sizable gains over the intermeeting period.
67,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
68,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
69,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
70,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
71,"To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent."
