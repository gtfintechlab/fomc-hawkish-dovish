0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity had continued to decline into the fourth quarter, although some very recent data suggested that the rate of decline might be moderating."
2,"Energy prices were moderating noticeably in response to lower worldwide demand, and core price inflation remained subdued."
3,"Nonfarm payroll employment fell significantly in both months, with the largest job losses occurring in manufacturing, help supply services, and retail trade."
4,"Steep cuts in employment also occurred in industries directly affected by the September attacks, notably transportation, lodging, and tourism."
5,"Among the few industries that had not been adversely affected were health services, which continued to add workers, and finance, insurance, and real estate, which maintained stable employment on balance."
6,The heavy job losses boosted the unemployment rate to 5.
7,"Industrial production fell sharply further in October, and the cuts continued to be spread widely across groups and industries, reflecting weak demand for business equipment, efforts by firms to pare inventories, and foreign competition."
8,"Residential building activity softened somewhat further in October, but in an environment of very low mortgage rates, homebuilding remained at a relatively high level despite the weak labor market and sluggish growth in personal income."
9,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed significantly in September and the third quarter, though most of those declines reflected estimated payments by foreign insurers related to the events of September 11."
10,"Abstracting from those payments, the trade deficit fell only a little in the third quarter as the value of exports fell by less than the value of imports."
11,"The limited available information suggested a further weakening of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries in the current quarter, but there were some indications of a possible brightening of the economic outlook in the period ahead despite a sharp decline in business confidence in the aftermath of the September terrorist attacks."
12,"Japan remained the weakest of the major foreign industrial economies, and the available information suggested further contraction in economic activity and worsened labor market conditions this quarter."
13,Economic growth in China seemed to have slowed a little.
14,"Core consumer price inflation remained at a relatively subdued pace in September and October, and a renewed decline in energy prices in October contributed to a sizable drop in total consumer price inflation during the twelve months ended in October when compared with the previous twelve-month period."
15,"The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index also indicated that consumer inflation was significantly lower during the year ended in October, while the core consumer price index (CPI), with its narrower range of spending categories, had changed little over the past year."
16,"Core producer prices for finished goods edged up on balance during September and October, but inflation as measured by this index moderated slightly on a year-over-year basis."
17,"With regard to labor costs, growth of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers slowed in September and October from the relatively moderate rate that had prevailed in earlier months."
18,"The members referred to the heightened degree of uncertainty and risk aversion following the terrorist attacks that was having a significant effect on business and household spending, and they noted that the substantial easing of monetary policy that had been put in place this year had not shown through fully to long-term interest rates, equity prices, bank lending rates, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
19,"In these circumstances, with price inflation relatively low and pressures on prices and resources likely to ebb further, the members concluded that further monetary stimulus would provide some added insurance against a more extended contraction of the economy at little risk of a pickup in inflation."
20,"Against the background of better-than-expected incoming economic data and of favorable news on military operations in Afghanistan, short-term interest rates declined a little over the intermeeting interval while intermediate- and long-term Treasury rates rose substantially."
21,"With market concerns about the economic outlook diminishing, yields on investment-grade corporate debt securities increased considerably less than those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, rates on speculative-grade bonds fell sharply, and major indexes of equity prices moved significantly higher."
22,"Abroad, central bank policy rates were lowered in the euro area, England, and Canada in response to indications of flagging economic activity."
23,"The Mexican peso changed little on balance, the Brazilian real firmed despite the deepening problems of Argentina, and the Korean won rose against the background of incoming data that suggested the persistence of resilient domestic demand."
24,M2 growth in November was robust though well below the average pace of the two previous months.
25,"Liquid deposits continued to increase rapidly, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates this year, but inflows to retail money funds slowed as the economic outlook improved and the equity markets rallied."
26,"M3 expansion remained at a very high rate in November, bolstered by the growth of M2 and heavy bank acquisitions of nondeposit liabilities."
27,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would extend its decline for a time in 2002 but then would begin to turn upward.
28,"The recovery would be supported in part by the cumulative easing that had occurred in the stance of monetary policy, along with the fiscal stimulus already in place and some assumed additional measures not yet enacted."
29,"The turnaround in the economy and the gradual strengthening of the recovery would also be fostered by the completion of downward adjustments to inventories, a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investments, and the added purchasing power arising from the recent declines in oil prices."
30,Economic expansion was projected to strengthen appreciably by the second half of 2002 as the climate for business fixed investment improved and a strengthening of foreign economies led to somewhat greater demand for U. S. exports.
31,Subpar expansion in the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
32,"The decline in inventories was likely to abate before long, boosting production, but the course of a recovery would depend on the behavior of final demand."
33,The recent statistical and anecdotal information was more mixed than had been the case earlier and pointed on balance toward some moderation in the decline of overall final demand; for the first time in a long while the incoming data did not call for a downward revision to current forecasts.
34,"Nonetheless, with the critical consumer sector holding up relatively well thus far, members continued to anticipate an upturn in the economy during the year ahead in light of the progress already made by business firms in reducing excess inventories and unwinding capital overhangs, and the beneficial effects of the decline of energy prices."
35,The lagged effects of the substantial easing in monetary policy this year and the fiscal stimulus measures already enacted into law were expected to buttress demand and economic recovery over the next year.
36,"The outlook for inflation was viewed as favorable, given the slack in labor and product markets, subdued inflationary expectations, and the prospect that aggregate demand would remain well below the economy's potential output over the next several quarters."
37,"Other potentially adverse economic factors cited by members included rising consumer debt burdens, the risk of a downturn in the stock market, and the recent rise in mortgage interest rates."
38,"However, consumer expenditures appeared to have been relatively well sustained thus far, evidently in part the result of widespread price discounting and low interest rates, including zero rates on many motor vehicle loans, that were helping to overcome a currently high degree of caution and price consciousness among consumers."
39,The significant decreases that had occurred in the prices of fuel oil and gasoline were a positive factor that would continue to bolster household spending for a while.
40,"Like consumer spending, new home construction and sales had displayed considerable resilience in recent months, apparently in large part as a result of relatively attractive mortgage interest rates and perhaps to some extent as a consequence of favorable weather conditions in many parts of the country."
41,"With regard to the outlook, the recent rise in mortgage interest rates could be expected to have a retarding effect on housing activity."
42,Business capital spending appeared to be continuing to decline at a rapid pace as business firms persisted in their efforts to bring production capacity into better alignment with forecasts for the growth of sales.
43,"Although an expansionary fiscal policy was already in place as a result of earlier legislation and more stimulus might be legislated next year, especially if the economy continued to deteriorate, members saw an additional boost to near-term economic activity from new fiscal initiatives as increasingly unlikely."
44,"Some members also commented on mounting state and local government deficits, largely the result of diminishing income and sales tax receipts, and the adverse implications for governmental budgets and spending in various parts of the country."
45,"Reflecting unusually synchronous global economic developments, foreign nations also were experiencing sluggish economic activity and in many instances actual recessions."
46,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States."
47,Expectations that output would remain below the economy's potential for some time led many members to believe that underlying inflation might well edge lower from its currently modest levels.
48,"Reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth, the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys."
49,"In these circumstances and given the persistence of highly competitive conditions in domestic and international markets, the ability of most businesses to raise prices was likely to remain quite limited or even nonexistent."
50,"While a number of members referred to the possibility of further disinflation, some also noted that the risks of a deflationary spiral seemed very limited, given the economy's self-correcting resilience and the ongoing effects of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies."
51,"While there were signs that the weakness in aggregate demand might be abating, those signs were still quite limited and tentative."
52,"For now, contractionary forces continued to depress overall economic activity, and subpar economic performance seemed likely to persist, at least for a time."
53,"Moreover, a number of members saw substantial risks that economic activity could even fall short of a projection of stabilization in the near term and moderate recovery later next year."
54,"If a modest easing action taken today turned out to be unneeded, the Committee would have ample opportunity to reverse its action without incurring any real risk of allowing inflationary pressures to gather momentum, given the projected degree of slack in resource use and the current absence of significant inflationary pressures."
55,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
56,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
57,It was also his position that reducing the federal funds rate at this meeting could increase interest rate volatility by creating an expectation of a faster or a more aggressive reversal of policy.
