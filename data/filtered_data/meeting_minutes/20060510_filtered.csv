0,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity expanded strongly in the first quarter and that gains were widespread across most categories of final sales.
1,Manufacturing production also posted solid gains in the first quarter and payroll growth moderated a bit in April after robust gains in employment in the first quarter.
2,"Overall consumer prices jumped in March because of higher energy prices, while core prices rose a bit more rapidly than in earlier months."
3,"Nonfarm payrolls increased by 138, 000 jobs in April following robust growth in March."
4,"The gains in April were widespread: Manufacturing and related industries registered significant increases, mining activity and employment were boosted by rising energy prices, construction hiring posted a moderate gain, and a range of services-producing industries strengthened, with the important exception of retail trade, which more than reversed its March gains."
5,The increases in the workweek and employment in April led to notable growth in aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers.
6,The unemployment rate edged down to 4.
7,"While manufacturing growth for the first quarter as a whole slowed from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it exceeded that of the previous year."
8,"Although continued improvements in the labor market had been generating considerable gains in nominal wage and salary income, rising gasoline prices held down the increase in real disposable personal income in March and were expected to damp it in April as well."
9,"Ongoing increases in home prices and additional gains in the stock market, however, further boosted household wealth during the first quarter."
10,House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.
11,"Growth in the average sales price of existing homes in March, versus a year earlier, decelerated sharply, and the average price for new homes in March fell compared to a year earlier."
12,"Much of the growth reflected a sharp jump in business purchases of transportation equipment, such as airplanes and motor vehicles."
13,Spending on high-tech equipment and software also improved as exceptionally strong growth in expenditures for communications equipment more than compensated for fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and on software.
14,"Although spending on nonresidential building construction remained well short of the robust levels seen in late 2000, growth of expenditures in this sector was at its fastest pace in the first quarter in nearly six years."
15,"Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in the first quarter, and available data pointed to ongoing growth."
16,The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as a sharp decrease in imports more than offset a modest fall in exports.
17,"Available data showed continued growth in GDP in the United Kingdom in the first quarter, continuing strong domestic demand in Canada through February, ongoing recovery in Japan, and a first-quarter rebound in euro-area economic performance."
18,Headline inflation turned up in March.
19,"Although the price of natural gas had fallen because of continued plentiful inventories, retail gasoline prices surged, leading to a jump in overall energy prices for the month."
20,"Prices of core goods and services also rose more quickly in March, largely because of a spike in the apparel component that unwound a decline in February and a one-time step-up in medical prices related to changes in Medicare reimbursement rules."
21,"During the twelve months ending in March, overall inflation rose at a slightly faster pace than that in the preceding twelve-month period, while core prices for the same period increased a bit more slowly than in the previous year."
22,"Producer price inflation also moved up in March, driven largely by higher food and energy prices."
23,Readings on the growth in the cost of labor were mixed.
24,"Over the three months ending in March, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at its slowest pace in several years."
25,"Data on compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, however, pointed toward notably faster growth in the first quarter."
26,"Some financial-market and survey indicators suggested that inflation expectations, both for the upcoming year and for the longer term, had moved up since the March meeting."
27,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that the slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seemed largely to have reflected temporary or special factors."
28,Economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but seemed likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.
29,"As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations had remained contained."
30,"Still, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, had the potential to add to inflation pressures."
31,"In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance, but reiterated that in any event the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."
32,"Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities moved up over the intermeeting period, but yields on nominal Treasury issues rose more."
33,"Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates."
34,"Domestic nonfinancial sector debt was estimated to have grown at a robust pace in the first quarter, down only slightly from the brisk pace of 2005. Business sector debt appeared to have expanded strongly, supported by significant net issuance of U. S. corporate bonds and double-digit growth of business loans at commercial banks."
35,"In the household sector, consumer credit continued to rise slowly, and the growth of household mortgage debt was thought, based on limited data, to have moderated somewhat in the first quarter against a backdrop of higher mortgage interest rates and some signs of a deceleration in house prices."
36,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters.
37,"The projected deceleration of real GDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary policy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth, and reduced stimulus from fiscal policy."
38,"While higher energy prices were expected to boost inflation in the near term, structural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher energy and material costs was thought likely to moderate."
39,"Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year."
40,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly so far this year after the slowing of growth in the fourth quarter."
41,Consumer prices recently had risen at a pace noticeably above the average rise over the previous twelve months.
42,"Also, prices of energy and many other commodities had climbed sharply of late, and inflation expectations appeared to have risen slightly."
43,"If economic growth continued to moderate over coming quarters, as anticipated, pressures on productive resources would most likely continue to be limited."
44,"Most participants expected that, after allowing for some possible near-term volatility related to the recent jump in energy and other commodity prices, core inflation would probably remain around the levels experienced on average over the past year."
45,"However, recent developments suggested that upside risks to inflation had risen somewhat since the time of the March meeting."
46,"In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, some participants noted that growth of household spending was likely to slow over the remainder of the year."
47,"Although fresh comprehensive data were not available, home prices on average appeared still to be rising, but at a slower pace than over the past few years."
48,"Going forward, growth in consumption spending was likely to be supported by gains in employment and personal income."
49,But slower appreciation of home prices and the effects of the increases in energy prices and interest rates that had already occurred would likely act to restrain consumption spending somewhat.
50,"Drilling and mining activity was said to be particularly strong, propelled by the high levels of energy prices."
51,"While the precise reasons for the increase in federal receipts were not entirely clear, robust income growth was probably an important factor."
52,"In any case, the effect was to trim the current federal budget deficit noticeably."
53,"Data on economic growth outside the United States indicated that the global expansion was firming, a sense amplified by reports from international contacts."
54,The apparent strengthening of global growth was likely to support U. S. exports and economic activity and would also tend to maintain upward pressures on energy and commodity prices.
55,Meeting participants expressed some concern about recent price developments and their implications for inflation prospects.
56,Core consumer inflation lately had been a little higher than expected.
57,"Moreover, energy prices had risen steeply in the period since the March meeting, and, although pass-through apparently had been limited to date, the most recent increases might be reflected to a greater degree in core inflation in coming months."
58,"Participants noted that prices of non-energy commodities, such as industrial metals and building supplies, also had been climbing."
59,"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited."
60,"However, participants also cited some factors that could be expected to restrain inflation."
61,"Although alternative measures of labor compensation provided divergent readings, growth of total compensation on balance appeared to remain moderate."
62,"And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services."
63,"While firms would seek to maintain those margins, recent experience suggested that this might be accomplished in part through further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters, rather than through more rapid price hikes."
64,Participants discussed in some detail inflation expectations--a potentially important factor influencing future inflation trends.
65,"Some surveys suggested that inflation expectations had risen in recent weeks, but others implied that expectations were little changed."
66,Measures of inflation compensation based on the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed issues had edged higher.
67,"It was possible, though, that investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen."
68,"On balance, participants judged that inflation expectations had risen somewhat--a development that would have to be taken into account in policymaking and warranted close monitoring--but remained contained."
69,"Although the Committee discussed policy approaches ranging from leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting to increasing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, all members believed that an additional 25 basis point firming of policy was appropriate today to keep inflation from rising and promote sustainable economic expansion."
70,Recent price developments argued for another firming step at today's meeting.
71,"Core inflation recently had been a bit higher than had been expected, and several members remarked that core inflation was now around the upper end of what they viewed as an acceptable range."
72,"Moreover, a number of factors were augmenting the upside risks to inflation: the surge in energy and commodity prices, some recent weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and the possibility that the apparent increase in inflation expectations could, if it persisted, impart momentum to inflation."
73,"In addition, the economy appeared to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization and had been growing quite strongly, and whether economic growth would moderate to a sustainable pace was not yet clear."
74,"At the same time, members also saw downside risks to economic activity."
75,"For example, the cumulative effect of past monetary policy actions and the recent rise in longer-term interest rates on housing activity and prices could turn out to be larger than expected."
76,"Still, it seemed most likely that, with modest further policy action, including a 25 basis point firming today, growth in activity would moderate gradually over coming quarters, pressures on resources would remain limited, and core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year."
77,"Given the risks to growth and inflation, Committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed after today's action."
78,"In view of the risk that the outlook for inflation could worsen, the Committee decided to repeat the indication in the policy statement released after the March meeting that some further policy firming could be required."
79,Members debated the appropriate characterization of inflation expectations in the statement.
80,Low and stable inflation expectations were key to the attainment of the Committee's dual objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.
81,"Accordingly, it appeared appropriate to characterize inflation expectations again as ""contained. """
82,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
83,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information."
