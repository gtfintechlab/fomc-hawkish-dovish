0,The information reviewed at the October meeting suggested that economic activity increased at a slow pace in the third quarter.
1,"The contraction in home construction remained a significant drag on economic activity, and steep reductions in motor vehicle assemblies further weighed on growth in the third quarter."
2,"Payroll employment extended its moderate expansion, on average, through September."
3,"Sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in September, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained elevated relative to year-earlier readings."
4,The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.
5,"Output growth in the high-technology sector softened a bit in September relative to the summer months, reflecting a smaller rise in the production of semiconductors."
6,"For the third quarter as a whole, growth in industrial production moderated a bit relative to the first half of the year; stronger output in the high-technology sector and a pickup in the production of business equipment partially offset a steep contraction in the output of motor vehicles and parts and a slowdown in mining output."
7,"Although nominal retail sales fell noticeably in September, the steep drop in gasoline prices more than accounted for the decline."
8,"But interest rates on some types of household loans, both short- and long-term, had risen this year, on balance."
9,"The latest readings on consumer sentiment had been positive, perhaps reflecting the recent declines in oil prices."
10,"Pending home sales, which rose somewhat in August after a noticeable drop in July, and the decline in mortgage rates since July likely indicated some support for housing demand in the near term."
11,"Still, the overhang of unsold homes remained historically high, and price appreciation of existing homes continued to slow through the second quarter."
12,"Outside of the motor vehicle sector, inventories generally appeared to be well aligned with demand."
13,"The U. S. international trade deficit widened to another record in August, reflecting a surge in imports that more than offset a sizable jump in exports."
14,"In the euro area, data on industrial production and retail sales were consistent with robust growth in real activity."
15,Mixed indicators in Canada and the United Kingdom suggested that output growth in those countries remained around recent rates.
16,"Incoming data across the emerging-market economies continued to point to moderating, but solid, growth in economic activity in the third quarter."
17,"Core prices for personal consumption expenditures were expected to have risen in September at the same pace as in July and August, leaving the change over the twelve months ending in September a bit higher than the year-earlier period."
18,"Increases in shelter costs, which accounted for a significant proportion of the pickup in core inflation over the past year, had slowed considerably in recent months but remained well above the rates that prevailed from 2003 to 2005."
19,"The price index for total personal consumption expenditures was estimated to have fallen markedly in September because of the steep decline in gasoline prices, bringing its twelve-month increase to a two-and-one-half-year low."
20,Retail gasoline prices fell especially rapidly in September as crude oil prices declined and as the historically high level of gasoline inventories likely led to a sharp narrowing of margins between retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices.
21,"The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only slightly in September; the increase was well below its average monthly advance over the preceding twelve months, reflecting a drop in prices of some chemicals that have a high energy content."
22,Survey measures of households' year-ahead inflation expectations eased substantially in early October with the sharp drop in energy prices.

24,"The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that the moderation in economic growth had appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market."
25,"Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
26,"However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand."
27,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained."
28,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."

31,"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities."
32,"In the household sector, the further slowing of the rate of increase of house prices appeared to have continued to weigh on the expansion of mortgage debt in the third quarter."
33,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies."
34,"Looking ahead, a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in GDP growth through 2007 and into 2008."
35,These gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income.
36,"Real GDP was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy."
37,"The projected increase in real output over the next year or so was a little below the staff's estimate of potential output growth, leading to a lessening in pressures on resource utilization."
38,Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 relative to the second half of this year because of the diminishing impetus from the prices of energy and other commodities and because of the modest easing in resource utilization.
39,"The most recent indicators suggested that economic growth had probably slowed more sharply in the third quarter than had been expected at the time of the September meeting, but that appeared to largely reflect the impact of temporary influences."
40,"Although recent monthly inflation readings indicated some slowing of core inflation from the very rapid rates of spring and early summer, many participants noted that current rates of core inflation remained undesirably high."
41,"Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, but they were quite uncertain as to the likely pace and extent of that moderation."
42,"In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that housing activity was likely to remain a substantial drag on economic growth over the next few quarters."
43,"Contacts in the building sector suggested that construction firms were attempting to reduce their backlogs of unsold homes, both by cutting back sharply on new construction and by offering substantial price incentives."
44,"To date, weakness in the housing market and the associated downshift in house price appreciation did not seem to be spilling over into consumer spending, which appeared to have grown at a steady pace in recent months."
45,"Meeting participants judged that consumer expenditures going forward were likely to expand at a steady pace a little below the growth in disposable income, supported by favorable financial conditions, continued increases in employment and income, and the recent decline in energy prices."
46,"Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern that ongoing developments in the housing market could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending, especially if house prices declined significantly."
47,Several participants noted that growth in nonresidential construction remained robust and was absorbing some of the resources displaced from the residential sector.
48,"The strength of corporate balance sheets and profits was seen as likely to help maintain a solid profile for investment spending over the next year or so, despite some restraint from the slower growth in final sales."
49,"However, one participant observed that the uncertainty concerning the possible severity of the current slowing in economic growth could lead some businesses to delay investment plans."
50,"In contrast to the steady expansion of consumer and business investment spending in recent months, several other components of output and demand appeared to have been somewhat weaker than expected."
51,"And strong growth in imports in July and August, driven in part by a surge in oil imports, suggested that net exports probably posed an arithmetic drag on economic growth in the third quarter."
52,"That said, one participant did note the possibility that the recent decline in oil prices may in part stem from weakness in global demand."
53,"However, the possibility that the tightness of the labor market could lead to a sustained increase in wage pressure was viewed by participants as an upside risk to costs and their expectations of a gradual decline in inflation."
54,"It was noted, though, that continuing high profit margins provided some scope for increased labor costs to be absorbed without necessarily leading to elevated price pressures."
55,All meeting participants expressed concern about the outlook for inflation.
56,"Most participants expected core inflation to edge lower, in part as the effects of the run-up in energy prices in recent years waned."
57,And shelter costs were not expected to add materially to inflation going forward.
58,"Moreover, moderate growth in aggregate demand and the associated modest easing of pressures on resource utilization should also contribute slightly to the slowing in core inflation."
59,Recent changes in core prices had declined slightly from earlier in the year.
60,"Nonetheless, nearly all participants viewed the current rates of core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation."
61,"The available measures suggested that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained around the levels seen for the past several years, although in the view of some participants these expectations were probably higher than would be consistent with their assessment of long-run price stability."
62,Participants were concerned that inflation expectations could begin to drift upwards if core inflation remained elevated for a protracted period.
63,Any such rise in inflation expectations and associated upward pressure on inflation itself would likely prove costly to reverse.
64,"Although some participants noted that the recent slowing in core inflation had helped to allay their fears of a further sustained increase in inflation, all participants emphasized that the risks around the desired downward path to inflation remained to the upside."
65,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting."

67,Nearly all members expected that the economy would expand close to or a little below its potential growth rate and that inflation would ebb gradually from its elevated levels.
68,"Although substantial uncertainty continued to attend that outlook, most members judged that the downside risks to economic activity had diminished a little, and likewise, some members felt that the upside risks to inflation had declined, albeit only slightly."
69,All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.
70,Members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should continue to convey that inflation risks remained the dominant concern and that additional policy firming was possible.
71,"The Committee concurred that the statement should mention both that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year and that, going forward, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace."
72,"With energy prices well off the highs reached earlier in the year, members felt that it was no longer appropriate to note that the high level of energy prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
73,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
74,"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain."
75,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
76,Votes against this action:Mr. Lacker Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to help ensure that core inflation declines to an acceptable rate in coming quarters.
77,The Committee then continued its discussion of communication issues and considered the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying an inflation objective.
78,Participants stressed that any such step had to be consistent with the statutory objectives for monetary policy.
79,"In that regard, it was noted that over time price stability is a prerequisite for maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates."
80,"However, the possible specification of a numerical price objective raised a number of complex and interrelated issues that required considerable further discussion."
