0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow little, if at all, in the second quarter."
2,"Energy prices had been relatively flat recently, at a high level, and core price inflation had moderated a little."
3,Private nonfarm payroll employment fell slightly further in May after a sharp drop in April and lackluster growth in the first quarter.
4,"Manufacturing recorded additional widespread job losses in May, and there were signs that weakness in employment was spreading to related sectors, notably wholesale trade and help-supply services."
5,"By contrast, construction employment rebounded in May, retracing part of its large April loss, and hiring in finance, insurance, and real estate remained brisk."
6,"The unemployment rate edged lower in May, to 4."
7,"4 percent, but initial unemployment insurance claims and other data suggested persisting softening in the labor market in that month."
8,"Growth of consumer spending seemed to have slowed in the second quarter, reflecting the deceleration in personal income, the rise in unemployment, and the earlier decline in household net worth."
9,Low mortgage rates continued to provide support to residential building activity in April and May despite a weakening labor market and sluggish growth in personal income.
10,The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services continued to shrink in April.
11,"Recent information indicated that economic growth in the euro area and the United Kingdom in the first quarter was at about the reduced pace seen in the fourth quarter, and growth likely stayed relatively slow more recently."
12,"In Japan, the contraction in economic activity that began early in the year appeared to have continued into the second quarter."
13,"Most of the developing countries, with the notable exception of China, also were experiencing an economic slowdown that was related at least in part to weaker external demand."
14,Core price inflation had moderated a little recently after a pickup earlier in the year.
15,"The core consumer price index (CPI) rose relatively slowly in April and May, and the increase in that index during the past twelve months was about the same as that during the previous twelve-month period."
16,"The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index presented a similar picture, with inflation in April and May a little lower than earlier in the year and no change in inflation on a year-over-year basis."
17,Core producer price inflation for finished goods also was subdued in the April-May period but edged higher on a year-over-year basis.
18,There also were indications that upward pressures on energy prices had abated somewhat.
19,"In particular, the return of some domestic refineries to operation after maintenance or breakdowns and a surge in imports had replenished gasoline stocks, and as a result wholesale and retail gasoline prices had retreated recently."
20,"The members generally agreed that this action was necessary in light of the continuing weakness of the economic expansion and the lack of evidence that output growth had stabilized or was about to rebound, coupled with a climate of fragile business and consumer confidence."
21,Other short-term market rates declined somewhat following the Committee's announcement of the easing action and subsequently moved down noticeably further in response to weaker-than-expected news on economic activity and corporate earnings.
22,"The pessimistic earnings reports also weighed on equity prices, which edged lower on balance."
23,"European currencies weakened in response to disappointing data on economic activity, with inflation concerns seen as constraining countervailing monetary easing actions."
24,"The real was adversely affected by Brazil's internal problems and spillovers from Argentina's financial difficulties, while the Mexican peso benefited from continued foreign interest in Mexican investments and from high oil prices."
25,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that after a period of very slow growth associated in large part with an inventory correction, a sizable decline in capital spending, and a related sharp contraction in manufacturing output, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the forecast horizon and move back to a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
26,The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
27,"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand."
28,"Business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, would be weaker for a while but would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels."
29,"The gradual strengthening of investment, together with a projected improvement in foreign economies that was seen as providing some support for U. S. exports, would foster the pickup in growth of demand and output."
30,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted that by some measures overall economic activity remained at a reasonably high level."
31,"However, recent data indicated that growth of spending and output was quite sluggish and below the pace many members had anticipated at the time of the previous meeting."
32,"Weakness in business spending for equipment and software, efforts to reduce excess inventories, and the ongoing adaptation to lower equity prices in the United States and around the world were likely to hold back economic activity in the short run."
33,"Nonetheless, the members continued to anticipate a strengthening as the year progressed and during 2002, fostered to a large extent by the lagged effects on spending of the substantial easing in monetary policy since early this year, the stimulus from recently enacted tax cuts, and the positive effects on household and business purchasing power of some recent reductions in energy prices."
34,"In addition, the abatement and eventual turnaround of the downward adjustments to capital spending and inventories would add impetus to economic growth going forward."
35,"Potential sources of shortfalls included the effects of possible further increases in unemployment on consumer and business confidence; the risks of disappointing business earnings that could damp investment and, through lower equity prices, consumption; and the growing indications of weakness in foreign economies that could limit demand for exports."
36,"In an environment of diminished pressures in product and labor markets and of lower energy costs, members commented that price pressures were likely to remain contained, at least over the near to intermediate term."
37,"In preparation for the mid-year monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2001 and 2002."
38,The civilian rates of unemployment associated with these forecasts had central tendencies of 4-3/4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002.
39,"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for this year and 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 2002."
40,Continuing softness in the expansion of economic activity was mirrored in anecdotal reports of business conditions in much of the nation.
41,Typical regional reports referred to slowing increases in economic activity from an already reduced pace or to the persistence of sluggish business activity and generally downbeat business sentiment.
42,"However, actions to reduce excess inventories or to address problems relating to overcapacity in some sectors of the economy, including telecommunications and other high-tech industries, were under way and were likely to exert a decreasing drag on economic activity over coming quarters as corrective adjustments were completed."
43,"Short- and intermediate-term interest rates had fallen substantially this year, and long-term yields had moved down late last year."
44,But equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated.
45,"In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, members noted that overall business activity had been supported, at least to this point, by the relative strength of household demand."
46,"Growth in consumer spending for goods and services, while moderating appreciably since earlier in the year, had nonetheless held up unexpectedly well given the adverse wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market prices, relatively high levels of consumer indebtedness, and job losses in a growing number of industries."
47,"Members referred in particular to the persisting strength in demand for light motor vehicles, which evidently was boosted by continuing sales incentives and attractive financing terms."
48,"Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending was subject to a number of downside risks that included the possibility of rising unemployment and further weakness in the stock market, which could damp consumer confidence as well as income and wealth."
49,"However, some further growth in consumer spending remained the most likely prospect for the balance of the year in light of the impetus provided by monetary and fiscal policy and the apparent stabilization in consumer sentiment in recent months after its earlier decline."
50,Housing activity remained at a high level as attractive mortgage interest rates evidently continued to counterbalance the negative effects on consumer attitudes of somewhat weaker labor markets and reduced stock market wealth.
51,"The weakness in spending for new equipment and software had played a key role in the softening of the overall expansion of economic activity in recent quarters, and a material pickup in such expenditures did not appear likely until the latter part of this year or early next year."
52,"Caution was especially pronounced among high-tech firms, many of which had experienced major cutbacks in the demand for their products and services."
53,"Beyond the nearer term, however, the prospects for an upturn in investment outlays seemed favorable in the context of profit opportunities associated with expectations of continued elevated rates of technological progress and rapid declines in the prices of new equipment."
54,"In this regard the members reviewed several staff reports that generally concluded that the growth of productivity in the years ahead was highly likely to remain appreciably stronger than it had been from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, though how much stronger was an open question."
55,"On balance, further modest growth in nonresidential construction, though well below the average pace in recent quarters, was seen as a likely prospect."
56,Business efforts to bring their inventories into better alignment with sales were a key factor in the deceleration of overall economic activity in recent quarters and in forecasts that the upturn in economic activity would be relatively limited over the balance of the year.
57,"With regard to the foreign sector of the economy, members commented that economic activity had softened more than anticipated in many nations that were important trading partners, with clearly negative implications for U. S. exports."
58,"Major Latin American countries were experiencing particularly severe economic difficulties, but growth was slowing or economic activity declining in many industrial countries as well."
59,"While growth abroad could be expected to rebound next year, responding in part to faster expansion in the U. S. economy, the nearer-term outlook for U. S. and indeed world trade was less favorable."
60,"In their review of the outlook for inflation, members generally anticipated that increases in consumer prices would remain relatively subdued over the next several quarters."
61,"Factors underlying that assessment included the emergence of less taut conditions in labor markets, relatively low capacity utilization rates in manufacturing, and the persistence of highly competitive conditions in most product markets that made it very difficult for business firms to preserve or increase their profit margins by raising prices."
62,"Moreover, energy prices recently had declined appreciably, and the earlier inflationary effects of energy price increases on a broad range of costs and prices appeared to have begun to subside as a result."
63,Inflation expectations that currently appeared by various measures and survey results to be essentially flat or even to have declined a bit were reinforcing the factors holding down price increases.
64,"Some negatives in the inflation outlook also were noted, such as some increase in labor compensation including rapid advances in health care costs, and a consequent squeeze on profit margins that was exacerbated by a cyclical decline in productivity gains."
65,"Labor pressures on business costs might persist for a time in lagged response to earlier advances in headline consumer price inflation and labor productivity, but their effects would tend to diminish or to be offset over time if, in line with the members' forecasts, pressures on labor resources continued to ease."
66,Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for wages and prices if the stimulative stance of monetary policy was maintained too long and allowed demand pressures to outrun the economy's potential.
67,"With greater slack in labor and product markets, and with inflation expectations contained, an added easing ran very little risk of exacerbating price pressures, provided the Committee was prepared to firm the stance of policy promptly if and when demand pressures threatened to intensify."
68,One member was persuaded that policy had already become so expansionary that further easing ran an unacceptable risk of exacerbating inflation over time.
69,"By a number of measures--including the level of real federal funds rates, the robust growth of the monetary aggregates, and the ready availability of finance to most borrowers--policy had become stimulative."
70,"In these circumstances, a smaller move than those undertaken earlier this year would have the advantage of reducing the odds on adding to inflation pressures later and of underlining the Committee's assessment of its policy stance."
71,"In the view of most members, however, the weakness of the recent information relating to the performance of the economy was consistent with unbalanced risks at least insofar as it pertained to the outlook for the rest of this year, and their primary policy concern at this point remained the strength of economic activity rather than potentially worsening inflation over the longer term."
72,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
73,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
74,Mr. Poole dissented because he believed that FOMC actions this year had already established a highly stimulative monetary policy stance.
75,Economic forecasts were that the economy's growth would resume later this year and the fact that long-term interest rates had not declined since December also indicated that the market anticipated a revival of faster economic growth before long.
76,"Given the lags in monetary processes, he believed that adding further monetary policy stimulus raised an undue risk of fostering higher inflation in the future."
77,"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates."
