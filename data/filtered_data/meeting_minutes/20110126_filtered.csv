0,Structural Unemployment A staff presentation on structural unemployment summarized a broad range of economic research on the topic conducted across the Federal Reserve System.
1,"Among the factors cited that could affect the level of structural unemployment were demographics, changes in the intensity of job search and worker screening, differences in the geographic locations of potential workers and vacant jobs, and mismatches in characteristics between potential workers and available jobs."
2,"Most of the research reviewed suggested that structural unemployment had likely risen in recent years, but by less than actual unemployment had increased."
3,"In discussing the staff presentation, meeting participants mentioned various factors that were seen as influencing the path of the unemployment rate."
4,Participants noted that many of the factors that contributed to the recent apparent rise in structural unemployment were likely to recede over time.
5,"Some participants stressed that certain determinants of the unemployment rate, such as mismatches in the labor market and firms' hiring practices, were both difficult to measure in real time and not directly affected by monetary policy."
6,"Others emphasized that in the current situation, monetary policy could still play an important role in reducing unemployment."
7,"Modest gains in employment continued, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
8,"Despite further increases in commodity prices, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and longer-run inflation expectations were stable."
9,"Private nonfarm payroll employment increased in December at a pace roughly the same as its average for 2010 as a whole, and the average workweek for all employees was unchanged."
10,"Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended lower in December and early January, and some indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans improved."
11,The unemployment rate decreased to 9.
12,"Long-duration unemployment remained elevated, and the employment-to-population ratio was still at a very low level at the end of the year."
13,"Moreover, household net worth appeared to have risen in the fourth quarter, as the large increase in equity prices more than offset further declines in house values."
14,"Activity in the housing market remained weak in an environment characterized by soft demand, a large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties on the market, and tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages."
15,"Moreover, measures of house prices declined further in recent months, and survey responses indicated that households remained concerned that home values might continue to fall."
16,"In contrast, investment in drilling and mining structures increased, buoyed by rising energy prices."
17,Measures of underlying consumer price inflation remained low.
18,"In December, the core consumer price index (CPI) edged up, as goods prices were unchanged and prices of non-energy services rose slightly."
19,"Other measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed-mean and median CPIs, also remained subdued."
20,"Despite the steep run-up in agricultural commodity prices over the second half of last year, increases in retail food prices remained modest."
21,"However, consumer energy prices moved up sharply in December, and prices of most types of crude oil increased during December and into January."
22,The prices of nonfuel industrial commodities also continued to rise over the intermeeting period.
23,"In December and early January, survey measures of households' long-term inflation expectations stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time."
24,"Available measures of labor compensation showed that labor cost pressures were still restrained, as wage increases slowed along with inflation and productivity gains appeared to remain substantial."
25,"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in November, as both nominal exports and imports moved up by almost the same amount."
26,"The increase in exports was driven by agricultural goods, in part reflecting higher prices, as well as by consumer goods."
27,"The rise in imports reflected an increase in the value of imported petroleum products, mostly explained by higher prices, and of capital goods, which was supported importantly by a jump in computers."
28,"These developments, combined with the substantial narrowing in the trade deficit in October, implied that the trade deficit likely shrank considerably in the fourth quarter of 2010."
29,Recent indicators of foreign economic activity suggested that the global recovery was strengthening.
30,"Much of this strength was centered in the emerging market economies (EMEs), where widespread increases in exports and in manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to a resurgence in economic growth following a slowdown in the third quarter of 2010."
31,"For China and Singapore, real gross domestic product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter confirmed a rebound in economic growth."
32,"In contrast, the rise in economic activity in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) remained at a subdued pace."
33,"The data also pointed to an uneven expansion across the euro area, suggesting that economic growth in Germany continued to outpace that in the euro-area periphery."
34,"Foreign inflation picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter of 2010, mostly because of an acceleration of energy and food prices."
35,"Measures of core inflation remained much more subdued, although they also moved up in some countries."
36,"In the EMEs, concerns about inflation prompted a number of central banks to tighten policy."
37,Both the accompanying statement and the minutes of the meeting were broadly in line with market expectations and elicited limited price action in financial markets.
38,"Inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) moved up, likely pushed higher by rising prices for oil and other commodities and by the firming of the economic outlook."
39,"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net."
40,"In the secondary market for leveraged loans, the average bid price moved up further over the intermeeting period."
41,The municipal bond market appeared to continue to price in an atypically high level of default risk.
42,"Broad U. S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, extending their recent strong performance; bank stock prices modestly outperformed the broader market."
43,The increase in equity prices reflected the apparent firming of the economic recovery and favorable early reports on fourth-quarter corporate earnings.
44,"However, for larger nonresidential properties in strong markets, credit appeared to have become somewhat less restricted, and prices moved up, on net, from their lows at the beginning of 2010; at the same time, prices of other nonresidential properties continued to trend down."
45,"Meanwhile, moderate net fractions of respondents indicated that demand for C&I loans had strengthened over the preceding three months, and that inquiries from business borrowers for new or increased credit lines had picked up."
46,"In contrast, demand reportedly weakened somewhat, on balance, for residential real estate loans and was little changed for consumer loans."
47,"Currency growth slowed in December, due in part to weather-related transportation difficulties that delayed flows of U. S. bank notes to international destinations."
48,"The dollar's decline appeared to reflect a variety of factors: signs of stronger economic activity abroad, particularly in the EMEs; actual and prospective monetary policy tightening in foreign economies; and increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, which lent support to the currencies of commodity-exporting countries."
49,Equity prices increased in the AFEs and in many EMEs as market participants appeared to revise upward their outlook for the global economy.
50,"However, the staff's outlook for the pace of economic growth over the medium term was adjusted only slightly relative to the projection prepared for the December meeting."
51,"Compared with the December forecast, the conditioning assumptions underlying the forecast were little changed and roughly offsetting: Although higher equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, the staff anticipated that these influences would be about offset by lower house prices and higher oil prices."
52,"In the medium term, the recovery in economic activity was expected to receive support from accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in financial conditions, and greater household and business confidence."
53,"Over the projection period, the rise in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to slowly reduce the rate of unemployment, but the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2012."
54,"The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was in line with what the staff anticipated at the time of the December meeting, and the staff continued to project that increases in core PCE prices would remain subdued in 2011 and 2012."
55,"As in previous projections, the persistent wide margin of economic slack in the forecast was expected to maintain downward pressure on inflation, but this influence was anticipated to be counterbalanced by the continued stability of inflation expectations and by increases in the prices of imported goods."
56,"The staff anticipated that brisk increases in energy prices would raise total consumer price inflation above core inflation this year, but that upward pressure from energy prices would wane by next year."
57,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the six members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run."
58,"Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks."
59,"While participants viewed the downside risks to their forecasts of economic activity over the projection period as having diminished, their assessment of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the projection period was not greatly changed."
60,"Most participants raised their forecast of real GDP growth in 2011 somewhat and continued to anticipate stronger growth this year than in 2010, with a further gradual acceleration during 2012 and 2013."
61,The unemployment rate was still projected to decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain elevated.
62,"Total inflation was still expected to remain subdued, and core inflation was projected to trend up slowly over the next few years as economic activity picks up but inflation expectations remain well anchored."
63,"On the one hand, the additional spending could reflect pent-up demand following the downturn or greater confidence on the part of households about the future, in which case it might be expected to continue."
64,"Payroll employment increased at a modest pace, and, although the data had been somewhat erratic, a slight downward trend was apparent in the recent pattern of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance."
65,"In addition, some surveys of employers suggested a somewhat more upbeat outlook for employment."
66,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010."
67,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next few years increased further over the intermeeting period, extending the rise that occurred over recent months."
68,"Some participants suggested that the increase likely reflected, in part, a decline in investors' perceptions of the near-term risk of further disinflation."
69,"At the same time, longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
70,"However, credit conditions remained tight for smaller, bank-dependent firms, although bank loan growth had clearly picked up in some sectors."
71,"Some participants noted that, taken together, these financial developments were consistent with a more accommodative stance of monetary policy since last summer or a reduction in risk aversion on the part of market participants."
72,"Meeting participants noted that headline inflation had been boosted by higher prices for energy and other commodities, as well as by increases in the prices of imported goods."
73,"Some participants indicated that while unit labor costs generally had declined and profit margins were wide, the higher commodity prices were boosting costs of production for many firms."
74,"Many participants expected that, with significant slack in resource markets and longer-term inflation expectations stable, measures of core inflation would remain close to current levels in coming quarters."
75,"However, the importance of resource slack as a factor influencing inflation was debated, and some participants suggested that other variables, such as current and expected rates of economic growth, could be useful indicators of inflation pressures."
76,"Accordingly, participants generally agreed that the downside risks to their forecasts of both economic growth and inflation--as well as the odds of a period of deflation--had diminished."
77,Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters.
78,"Most participants continued to anticipate that the recovery in economic activity was likely to be restrained by a variety of economic factors, including still-high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, high rates of mortgage foreclosure, elevated inventories of unsold homes, and tight credit conditions in a number of sectors."
79,"In addition, although many business contacts expressed more optimism about the economic recovery, a number had aimed their recent investments primarily at enhancing productivity rather than expanding employment, and hiring for some businesses reportedly was focused on temporary workers."
80,"Some participants noted that incoming data on production, spending, and employment would need to be solid for a while longer to justify a significant upward revision to their outlook for the likely pace of the recovery."
81,"Participants generally saw the risks to their outlook for economic growth and employment as having become broadly balanced, but they continued to see significant risks to both sides of the outlook."
82,"On the upside, the recent strength in household spending raised the possibility that domestic final demand could snap back more rapidly than anticipated."
83,"Regarding risks to the inflation outlook, some participants noted that increases in energy and other commodity prices as well as in the prices of imported goods from EMEs posed upside risks."
84,"Others, however, noted that the pass-through from increases in commodity prices to broad measures of consumer price inflation in the United States had generally been fairly small."
85,"Some participants expressed concern that in a situation in which businesses had been unable to raise prices in response to higher costs for some time, firms might increase them substantially once they found themselves with sufficient pricing power."
86,"In any case, the factors affecting the ability of businesses to pass through higher prices to consumers were viewed as complex and hard to monitor in real time."
87,"Most participants saw the large degree of resource slack in the economy as likely to remain a force restraining inflation, and while the risk of further disinflation had declined, a number of participants cited concerns that inflation was below its mandate-consistent level and was expected to remain so for some time."
88,"Finally, some participants noted that if the very large size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet led the public to doubt the Committee's ability to withdraw monetary accommodation when doing so becomes appropriate, the result could be upward pressure on inflation expectations and so on actual inflation."
89,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that no changes to the Committee's asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting."
90,"While the information received over the intermeeting period increased members' confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery, the pace of the recovery was insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions, and measures of underlying inflation had trended downward."
91,"Moreover, the economic projections submitted for this meeting indicated that unemployment was expected to remain above, and inflation to remain somewhat below, levels consistent with the Committee's objectives for some time."
92,"Accordingly, the Committee agreed to continue to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities as announced in November in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Committee's mandate."
93,"Members emphasized that the Committee would continue to regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program in light of incoming information--including information on the outlook for economic activity, developments in financial markets, and the efficacy of the purchase program and any unintended consequences that might arise--and would adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability."
94,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
95,"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
96,"Growth in household spending picked up late last year, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
97,"Although commodity prices have risen, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward."
98,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
99,"Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate."
100,"Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow."
101,"To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November."
102,The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
103,"The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
104,"The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. """
105,"Several participants noted that increased clarity of communications was a key objective, and some referred to the central role of communications in the monetary policy transmission process."
