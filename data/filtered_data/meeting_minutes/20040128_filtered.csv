0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.
1,"Despite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving only slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the fourth quarter."
2,"Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003."
3,The December employment report suggested that the labor market had not gained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way.
4,"The average monthly increase in employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery in the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average monthly loss during the first half of the year."
5,"Despite the weak payroll data, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey, fell to 5."
6,"Initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference week for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth in January."
7,"In the high-tech sector, real outlays for computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted sizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications equipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth."
8,The international trade deficit in November shrank to its lowest level in about a year.
9,Recent data indicated that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued in the fourth quarter.
10,"And Canadian employment and sales data were strong in the fourth quarter, with the housing sector continuing to make a significant contribution to growth."
11,"Overall consumer prices were flat, on balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices and a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy prices."
12,"Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase that was noticeably below that in the previous year."
13,Core consumer prices decelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year.
14,"Producer prices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance was substantially above that over the previous year."
15,The rise last year was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over 2002.
16,"In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal."
17,They also judged that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and now appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
18,"Nevertheless, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period."
19,"The Committee’s decision at the December meeting to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent appeared to have been fully anticipated in financial markets, and interest rate futures for the first half of 2004 were essentially unchanged after the announcement."
20,"But futures rates for the second half of the year rose a few basis points, presumably in response to the Committee’s assessment that the probability of an unwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level almost equal to that of a rise in inflation."
21,"Subsequently, however, the release of the minutes for the October FOMC meeting, which indicated that at that time the Committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent slack arising from rapid productivity growth, and the publication of surprisingly modest growth in employment in December led most market participants to push back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months to some time in the fall."
22,"Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell by nearly as much, suggesting that the drop in nominal yields owed more to lower real interest rates than to reduced inflation compensation."
23,Ongoing investor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its current account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting pressure on the dollar.
24,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum in economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would carry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing gains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement in labor market conditions.
25,The considerable stimulus being provided by fiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on a solid uptrend.
26,"In addition, improving labor market conditions and the effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected to support household spending, while business investment spending was seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output, swelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions."
27,Some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets.
28,"In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members commented that the information that had become available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the year progressed."
29,"Factors underlying a favorable outlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, and the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business investment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes."
30,"The members nonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic activity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in employment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor markets."
31,"Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth, they saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward."
32,"Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity."
33,"Core consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such inflation from its current subdued level."
34,"Over the year ahead, however, the members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price inflation."
35,"In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004."
36,"The forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth in economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite low rate of inflation."
37,The projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.
38,"Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent, with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent."
39,"While many contacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities provided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors in guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment spending to expand capacity."
40,"Business inventories were at exceptionally low levels in relation to sales, and if further brisk growth in demand broadly in line with current forecasts materialized this year, business firms could be expected to make commensurate additions to their inventories."
41,A key factor that had tended to hold down hiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing demand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than hiring new workers.
42,"Looking ahead, the members saw considerably faster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further strengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in the growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters."
43,"Several emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement in employment were subject to considerable uncertainty."
44,"Household spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices, and increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook."
45,"With respect to the outlook for overall consumer spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded."
46,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates."
47,Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance of the economy.
48,"In their comments about the international economy, members noted that the strengthening in economic activity abroad and the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar had boosted exports."
49,"Even so, the ongoing strength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and net exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic activity over the year ahead."
50,"In the Committee’s discussion of the outlook for inflation, the members agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain muted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually reducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity exerting downward pressure on costs and prices."
51,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain."
52,"Accordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price inflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion about the most probable direction."
53,"In the view of many, some modest further disinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect."
54,"A few members noted that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity, could be viewed as non-threatening."
55,"Moreover, the expected strength in aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time."
56,"A few members expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well edge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus stemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility that the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially if it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated with slower growth in productivity."
57,"The evidence pointing to the possibility of an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted that in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities including oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms had been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher levels in an effort to pass on increases in costs."
58,"In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other resources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level, and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction over the year ahead."
59,"” The existing language had been explicitly qualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack in resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions rather than simply on the passage of time."
60,” Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed that the new wording conveyed important information about the Committee’s strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial markets.
61,"At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
62,The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
63,The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
64,"With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."
