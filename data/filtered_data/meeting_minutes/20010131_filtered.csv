0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity had slowed appreciably over the fourth quarter.
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector."
3,"Manufacturing production declined sharply as a result, and overall employment gains moderated further."
4,Price inflation was still relatively subdued.
5,"Labor demand softened further in December, with private nonfarm payroll employment continuing to increase slowly and the average workweek to decline."
6,"Nonetheless, the labor market remained very tight and the unemployment rate held at 4 percent, its average for the year."
7,"Reduced labor demand in manufacturing accounted for much of the slowdown in nonfarm payroll gains in the fourth quarter, with factory payrolls falling sharply further in December, but in addition sizable cuts in net new hires were recorded in the help-supply and construction industries."
8,"Against a background of slowing growth of disposable personal income and abrupt declines in consumer sentiment, consumer spending decelerated substantially in the fourth quarter."
9,The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services fell slightly in October and November after having posted a new record high in September.
10,"Nevertheless, the average deficit for October and November was larger than the rate for the third quarter."
11,Economic growth in foreign industrial countries moderated in the second half of last year.
12,"In Japan, available indicators suggested that economic activity had stagnated in the fourth quarter."
13,Economic growth in Canada and the United Kingdom seemed to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter.
14,"By most measures, price inflation had remained moderate in recent months."
15,"Judging by the consumer price index (CPI), total and core consumer prices rose mildly over November and December, but both accelerated somewhat on a year-over-year basis."
16,"In terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index, however, core consumer price inflation was modest in both November (latest data) and the twelve months ended in November, and there was essentially no change year over year."
17,"At the producer level, core prices edged up over the November-December period, and the rise in core prices over the year was minimal as well."
18,"With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers (ECI) decelerated noticeably in the fourth quarter, with both the wage and benefit components recording smaller gains."
19,"However, growth of ECI compensation picked up somewhat in 2000 from 1999, probably owing in large part to the upward trend in productivity growth."
20,"Indeed, very recent information seemed to signal sudden further weakness, but it was largely anecdotal and most of the aggregate data on spending and employment suggested continued economic expansion, albeit at a relatively slow rate."
21,"As a result, most members believed that it would be prudent to await further confirmation of a noticeably weaker expansion before implementing any monetary easing, particularly given the current high level of resource utilization and the record over the last several years of strong rebounds from brief lulls in growth."
22,"The federal funds rate remained close to the Committee's targets over the intermeeting period, and interest rates on short-term Treasury securities and high-quality private debt obligations declined over the period almost as much as the funds rate."
23,"The Committee's action seemed to help ease some concerns about the longer-term outlook, and risk spreads on lower-grade bonds fell substantially while broad indexes of U. S. stock market prices rose on balance over the intermeeting period."
24,The dollar lost ground against the euro as market participants took note of the deterioration of near-term prospects for economic growth in the United States relative to those for Europe.
25,"The dollar posted a small gain against an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, largely reflecting expectations that some emerging economies might be adversely affected by slower growth in the United States."
26,The pickup in M2 growth evidently reflected a flight from heightened equity market volatility late last year to the safety and liquidity of M2 assets along with a recent narrowing of the opportunity costs of holding funds in M2 accounts.
27,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a pause associated in part with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would regain strength over the next two years and gradually move to a rate near the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
28,The period of sub-par activity was expected to foster an appreciable slackening of resource utilization and some moderation in core price inflation.
29,"The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices, the remaining effects of prior monetary restraint, and the continuation of somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions."
30,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that of the first half of last year and housing demand to be about unchanged from its recent level."
31,"Business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to resume relatively robust growth after a comparatively brief period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels; growth abroad was seen as supporting the expansion of U. S. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary."
32,"Some also observed that, counter to the experience generally associated with the onset of earlier recessions, monetary growth had been well maintained in recent months, and a few noted that long-term interest rates currently were appreciably below their peaks of the past year."
33,The prospect that fiscal policy might begin to move in an expansionary direction later in the year was cited as another factor in the outlook for stronger economic activity.
34,"A decline in energy prices, should it materialize as anticipated in futures markets, would have a positive effect on both business and consumer spending by lowering business costs and raising disposable consumer incomes adjusted for energy costs."
35,"Perhaps the most critical element in this outlook was the persistence of elevated growth in structural labor productivity, which seemed likely to play a vital role in supporting growth in incomes and aggregate demand while also helping to limit inflation pressures."
36,"Energy prices remained elevated and were continuing to depress business and household purchasing power; the overhang of excess capital stocks in some sectors could turn out to be sizable, depressing investment spending for some time; consumer confidence could worsen appreciably more in the face of weaker expansion of incomes and higher job layoffs; and investor concerns about earnings could increase further, sparking lower equity prices and tighter standards and terms on credit."
37,"Except for prices of energy and medical services, the currently available information indicated relatively subdued rates of inflation, and recent surveys pointed to little change in inflation expectations."
38,"Looking ahead, members anticipated that somewhat reduced pressures in labor and product markets would foster some softening in consumer price inflation over coming quarters, a development that would be abetted should prices of oil and natural gas ease during the year in line with current market expectations."
39,"In preparation for a semi-annual report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth in nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 2001."
40,"The forecasts were concentrated in ranges of 4 to 5 percent for the growth in nominal GDP and 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the expansion in real GDP, implying some strengthening of economic activity as the year progressed."
41,"With growth in business activity falling short of the expansion in the economy's potential, the rate of unemployment was expected to rise somewhat to an average of about 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of the year."
42,"Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, reflecting declines from the inflation rate last year largely stemming from the projected reductions in energy prices."
43,"There was some evidence that sales had stabilized and possibly risen slightly in January, though a part of the improvement could reflect steep price discounts for the purpose of reducing inventories."
44,"An important factor in this outlook was the expectation of some reduction in energy prices, which would boost disposable incomes available for non-energy expenditures and likely provide a fillip to consumer sentiment in the process."
45,"Moreover, with the relatively high rate of growth in structural productivity showing little or no signs of waning, the longer-run prospects for household incomes remained positive."
46,"In this regard, members referred to earlier unsustainable rates of investment by many high-tech firms that were now obliged to retrench despite still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services."
47,"On balance, while the business investment outlook seemed vulnerable to somewhat greater than projected weakness in the short run, the members were persuaded that, against the background of large continuing gains in structural productivity and cost savings from further investment in equipment and software, business firms were likely to accelerate their spending for new capital after a period of adjustment."
48,Reduced mortgage interest rates appeared to be largely offsetting the marked decline in consumer confidence.
49,"Accordingly, and contrary to the experience in earlier periods of softening economic activity, the stabilization of housing activity at a pace near its current fairly high level was seen as a reasonable expectation."
50,Members expressed some divergence of views regarding the outlook for foreign economic activity and the implications for the domestic economy.
51,"The large current account deficit was seen as a factor pointing to potential depreciation of the dollar over time, with adverse repercussions on domestic inflation albeit favorable effects on exports."
52,"In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members noted that current indicators continued on the whole to point to subdued price increases, with lagging demand and strong competitive pressures in many markets severely limiting the ability of business firms to raise their prices."
53,"Labor markets were described as still tight across the nation, but reports of layoffs in specific industries were increasing and numerous business contacts indicated that openings were now much easier to fill in many job markets."
54,"Against the background of a sluggish economy in the near term and forecasts of only moderate economic growth, the members anticipated that inflation would remain contained over the forecast horizon."
55,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.
56,Other factors included the prospect of some decline in energy prices and the persistence of generally benign inflation expectations.
57,"On balance, with pressures in labor and product markets ebbing, the outlook for inflation was a source of diminished though persisting concern."
58,"The extent and duration of the current economic correction remained uncertain, but the stimulus provided by the Committee's policy easing actions would help guard against cumulative weakness in economic activity and would support the positive factors that seemed likely to promote recovery later in the year."
59,"As a consequence, monetary policy reactions to shifts in economic trends needed in this view to be undertaken more aggressively and completed sooner than in the past."
60,"In current circumstances, members saw little inflation risk in such a ""front-loaded"" easing policy, given the reduced pressures on resources stemming from the sluggish performance of the economy and relatively subdued expectations of inflation."
61,The members saw substantial underlying strength and resilience in the economy and they remained optimistic about its prospects beyond the near term in light of the monetary policy stimulus that was being implemented and the persistence of rapid advances in productivity.
62,"But with the adjustments to the stock of capital, consumer durable goods, and inventories to more sustainable levels likely only partly completed and with investors in financial markets remaining skittish, the risks that growth would persist below that of the economy's productivity-enhanced potential continued to dominate the outlook."
63,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
64,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
