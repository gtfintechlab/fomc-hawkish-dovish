0,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1998, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,Both employment and industrial output recorded substantial increases in the fourth quarter.
2,"While spending for final goods and services by U. S. residents decelerated noticeably, inventory investment strengthened and the deficit in international trade in goods and services appeared to have narrowed."
3,"Tighter labor markets brought some acceleration in wages, but falling import and energy prices helped to hold down price inflation over the closing months of the year."
4,"Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp increase in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large advances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on balance over the three-month period."
5,"In the fourth quarter, new hires in manufacturing accounted for more than half of that sector's total for the year, and construction employment also registered an unusually large rise compared with earlier in 1997."
6,Job growth surged in retail trade and persisted at a rapid pace in service-producing industries.
7,"The civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
8,"Housing demand continued to exhibit considerable strength at year-end in the context of sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates in recent months, further sizable gains in employment and household income, and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions."
9,"However, the outlook for further growth remained positive, with corporate cash flow still healthy and the user cost of capital still low."
10,Business spending on nonresidential structures declined slightly in the fourth quarter despite rising real estate prices and falling vacancy rates.
11,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter.
12,"In Asia, weakness in economic activity in Japan continued into the fourth quarter, and persisting financial turmoil was having strong adverse effects on the economies of a number of developing countries."
13,"Consumer price inflation remained low in December, damped by a sizable further drop in energy prices and a small decline in food prices."
14,"Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs of services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost to core consumer price inflation in December."
15,"For the year as a whole, prices of core consumer items rose considerably less than in 1996, in part reflecting the effect of declining import prices."
16,"At the producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core finished goods component declined further in December."
17,"For the year 1997, the core producer price index was little changed after a relatively small rise the previous year; the total index, weighed down by falling prices of finished food and energy items, partially reversed its 1996 increase."
18,"Prices also remained subdued at earlier stages of processing in 1997, with prices of crude materials falling substantially."
19,Reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
20,"Most other domestic market interest rates moved down on balance during the intermeeting period, apparently as a result of increased concerns over the turbulence in Asia and its potential implications for the U. S. economy."
21,"Share prices in U. S. equity markets moved up slightly on net, perhaps partly in response to the bond market rally, while equity markets in some other countries, notably in Asia, remained unsettled."
22,Large increases in repurchase agreements contributed to rapid growth of M3 in January; the rise in M3 helped to finance further solid expansion of bank credit.
23,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999.
24,The staff analysis suggested that slower growth abroad and the considerable rise that already had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would exert substantial restraint on the demand for U. S. exports and subject domestic producers to even stiffer competition from imports.
25,"As output growth slowed, pressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat."
26,"None- theless, it was expected that, consistently measured, inflation would increase to some degree over the ensuing period through 1999, owing in part to an abatement of restraining forces from foreign exchange and oil markets."
27,They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate.
28,"Nonetheless, their assessments of the various factors bearing on the outlook led them to conclude that appreciably slower economic growth was in the offing for the year ahead, possibly to a pace in the vicinity of current estimates of the economy's long- run growth potential."
29,"Partly as a consequence, the outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well."
30,"Moreover, questions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output."
31,"Members observed that price inflation had remained subdued, and by some measures had declined, in recent months despite very tight labor markets and indications of somewhat faster increases in labor compensation."
32,"In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year ahead."
33,"Based on developments over the second half of 1997, the central tendency of the projections for 1998 now pointed to slightly more strength in real GDP and appreciably less inflation than the forecasts prepared at the time of the July 1997 meeting."
34,"Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, implying little or no change from the current level."
35,"With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1998, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-1/2 to 5 percent."
36,"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices."
37,"Exports to affected Asian nations were likely to be held back by declining incomes and rising prices of U. S. products in local currencies, and reportedly also by difficulties that importing firms in Asia were encountering in securing financing."
38,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.
39,Members viewed further growth in consumer spending as likely to remain the major factor in sustaining the expansion in overall economic activity.
40,"Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years."
41,"While the growth in personal expenditures was likely to moderate somewhat from its recent pace, members did not rule out a more ebullient consumer sector in the context of substantial further growth in disposable incomes, favorable financing conditions for purchases of homes, automobiles, and other consumer durables, and the high level of stock market prices."
42,"Business fixed investment also was expected to provide substantial support to continued economic expansion, though some moderation in purchases of business equipment seemed likely after the exceptionally rapid rates of growth in such investments in recent years."
43,"Positive indications for the housing outlook included relatively low mortgage interest rates, very favorable measures of cash-flow affordability, and quite positive home-buying attitudes as expressed in recent surveys."
44,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation."
45,"Some members commented, however, that there were reasons to discount the sharp fourth-quarter increase in the employment cost index because to a large extent it was the result of nonrecurring developments in a limited number of industries."
46,"Despite the upward trend in labor compensation, gains in productivity clearly had kept increases in unit labor costs at a very modest level; and with unit nonlabor costs continuing to decline, overall unit cost increases had remained not far above zero."
47,"In these circumstances--and in the context of highly competitive conditions in many markets, declines in input prices and in the prices of many commodities, including oil--rising labor costs seemed to pose little risk of an upward impetus to inflation in coming months."
48,The longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and under some scenarios less promising.
49,"Inflation expectations had been moving down according to recent surveys, and in the context of relatively modest increases in consumer prices expected over coming months such expectations could continue to move lower, thereby constraining increases in compensation and prices."
50,"Nonetheless, some of the factors that had helped to moderate price increases--including declining oil prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and restrained increases in health insurance costs--were not likely to continue to exert benign effects on inflation as time went on."
51,"More fundamentally, the productivity improvement that had held down producer costs could not necessarily be counted on to continue to offset such costs, especially if the economic expansion remained sufficiently rapid to put additional pressures on available labor resources."
52,"In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1998 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in July 1997."
53,The associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1998.
54,"In reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a staff projection indicating that, given the members' expectations for the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates, M2 likely would grow in 1998 in the upper half of its tentative range, and M3 somewhat above the top of its range."
55,"The velocity of M3 was projected to continue to decline at a somewhat faster rate than historical experience would indicate, reflecting the greater use by business firms of institution-only money market funds as a cash management tool and the needs of depository institutions for appreciable non-M2 funding to finance brisk loan growth."
56,"As a consequence, substantial uncertainty still surrounded projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy."
57,"In this environment, the members did not see any firm basis for deviating from their recent practice of setting ranges that, assuming velocity behavior in line with historical patterns, would serve as benchmarks for monetary expansion consistent with longer-run price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth."
58,"Indeed, adjusting the ranges to center them more closely on growth rates deemed likely to be more consistent with the Committee's expectations for economic activity and prices could foster the misinterpretation that the Committee had become much more confident of the stability and predictability of velocity and was placing greater emphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy."
59,"Several members commented, however, that the adoption of ranges centered on the Committee's expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates should be reconsidered in the future if the members were to become more confident about the relationship between the growth of the money and measures of aggregate economic performance."
60,The tentative range readily encompassed the pace seen as likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.
61,"Accordingly, the following statement of longer-run policy for 1998 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
62,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
63,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
64,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
65,The economy currently was performing very well and the outlook over the near term was for subdued inflation and continued solid economic growth.
66,"Over a longer horizon, the range of possible outcomes was unusually wide, and the direction that policy would need to move to promote sustained expansion and damped inflation was unclear."
67,"At this point, the extent to which the still largely anticipated external drag from events in Asia would offset the strong upward momentum in domestic demand was a source of major uncertainty."
68,"In addition, it was impossible to predict whether or when the tightness in labor markets would exert a more pronounced effect on labor costs and ultimately on price inflation."
69,Even the thrust of the current stance of monetary policy as it was transmitted through financial markets was open to some question.
70,"From a different perspective, however, financial conditions seemed to be quite stimulative as evidenced by lower nominal and perhaps real intermediate and long-term interest rates, rising equity prices, ready credit availability, and rapid growth of the broad measures of money and credit."
71,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the members decided that a slightly higher or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
72,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
73,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the closing months of 1997."
74,"Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in December after posting very large gains in other recent months; the civilian unem ployment rate, at 4."
75,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed significantly on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter.
76,Price inflation has remained subdued despite appreciably faster increases in worker compensation in recent months.
77,"Most interest rates have declined on balance since the day before the Committee meeting on December 16, 1997."
78,"Share prices in U. S. equity markets have moved up somewhat over the period; equity markets in some other countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile."
79,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
80,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
81,The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
82,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
83,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
84,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
