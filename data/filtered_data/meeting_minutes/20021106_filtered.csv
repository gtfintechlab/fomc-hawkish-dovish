0,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had slowed from the moderate pace of the third quarter.
2,"Industrial production had slipped in recent months and private payroll employment had changed little, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend."
3,"Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting both favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a continuing decline in core inflation."
4,Private nonfarm payroll employment declined in September and October after four previous months of modest gains in hiring.
5,"Total hours worked by private production workers moved down in October, and initial claims for unemployment insurance were at a relatively elevated rate."
6,The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.
7,Retail sales of non-auto goods also decreased in September after having registered only modest growth in July and August.
8,"Residential housing activity, supported by mortgage rates near historical lows, remained very strong in September despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth."
9,The strength of housing demand was also reflected in further rapid gains in home prices.
10,The return to positive growth of spending for equipment and software was led by robust business outlays for computers and peripheral equipment and for motor vehicles.
11,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened in August, and the average deficit for July and August was virtually unchanged from that for the second quarter."
12,The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested mixed results.
13,"In the euro area and Japan, growth appeared to be weakening."
14,"Mexico has been largely unaffected by the financial and political problems of major South American countries, but it nonetheless experienced slower economic growth in the third quarter."
15,Consumer price inflation continued to trend downward in September.
16,The rise in consumer prices for the year ending in September was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month period.
17,"While much of that drop reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, core inflation also declined noticeably."
18,"Judged by consumer surveys, slower price increases over the past year apparently led consumers to lower their expectations of near-term inflation."
19,"At the producer level, prices for core finished goods likewise decelerated over the twelve months ended in September."
20,"With regard to labor costs, growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers declined significantly over the twelve months ended in September, evidently reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation."
21,The subsequent release of better-than-expected news on profits for several major corporations buoyed equity prices and lifted market interest rates and predicted policy rates.
22,"M2 grew more moderately on average in September and October, with aggregate spending apparently softening, the effects of past monetary easing actions wearing off, and significantly weaker foreign demand for currency emerging."
23,"By contrast, the high level of mortgage refinancing activity provided a continuing boost to deposit growth."
24,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of further weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted for some time."
25,"Moreover, current and prospective sluggish economic growth among major trading partners would damp U. S. exports, and businesses and households were likely to hold their spending down while faced with the possibility of a military conflict as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings."
26,"Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time and economic activity strengthen gradually."
27,"The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending."
28,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.
29,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the recent data on the performance of the economy had been disappointing and had tended to confirm widespread anecdotal indications that economic growth had slowed to a pace well below that experienced earlier in the year."
30,"Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery."
31,"With pressures on labor and other resources expected to be limited over coming quarters, inflation was likely to remain subdued and perhaps even to edge a little lower."
32,"Factors cited by the members that appeared to help account for the recent softness in consumer demand included substantial decreases in equity wealth, declining consumer confidence in the context of geopolitical and other uncertainties, the waning effects of earlier income tax cuts, and the failure of the most recent round of motor vehicle sales incentives to maintain the extraordinary level of sales seen during the summer."
33,There also was some question as to whether funds extracted from rising home equity values would continue to provide as important a source of financing for purchases of consumer durables as they had for some time unless mortgage interest rates declined from their already low levels.
34,"These included the prospect of strengthening consumer confidence if geopolitical uncertainties began to dissipate, the gradual diminution of the negative wealth effects from earlier stock market declines, and importantly the outlook for continued robust growth in structural labor productivity and its favorable effects over time on wages and salaries."
35,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures."
36,"In the latter regard, it was suggested that in the context of rising productivity, profits could prove to be stronger than many now expected, with favorable implications for cash flows and in turn investment activity."
37,"Nonetheless, some members commented that inventory accumulation was likely to provide some limited impetus to the economy over the next several quarters to the extent that an acceleration in economic activity occurred and businesses sought to maintain an acceptable balance between their inventories and sales."
38,Housing activity had remained at a generally elevated level in recent months and in the context of low mortgage interest rates likely would continue to provide important support to the economy over the forecast period.
39,"In this regard, it was noted that the declining trend in mortgage interest rates probably would not continue once forecasts of a strengthening economic expansion began to materialize."
40,"Still, household spending probably would continue to be supported by the increases in income and wealth associated with strengthening economic expansion and rising productivity."
41,"At the state and local government levels, efforts to control very large deficits likely would lead to tax and spending legislation that would offset at least part of the remaining stimulus inherent in the federal budget."
42,"Indeed, recent forecasts incorporated downward revisions to the growth of overall foreign economic activity."
43,"With the economy evidently on a lower-than-anticipated growth path and with slack in labor and product markets at elevated levels, members anticipated that inflation would remain quite subdued over the year ahead even in the context of some anticipated acceleration in economic activity."
44,"Indeed, the prospect of some persisting slack in resource use over coming quarters pointed to further disinflation."
45,"In this regard, some members referred to the possibility, which they viewed as remote, of a period of deflation in the event of a strongly negative demand shock."
46,"While the current stance of monetary policy was still accommodative and was providing important support to economic activity, the members were concerned that the generally disappointing data since the previous meeting, reinforcing the general thrust of the anecdotal evidence in recent months, pointed to a longer-lasting spell of subpar economic performance than they had anticipated earlier."
47,"In the circumstances, a relatively aggressive easing action could help to ensure that the current soft spot in the economy would prove to be temporary and enhance the odds of a robust rebound in economic activity next year."
48,"The members agreed that monetary policy could do little to improve the performance of the economy in the near term, but some emphasized that a 50 basis point easing likely would feed through to some degree to market interest rates, with favorable implications for spending next year."
49,Members commented that the potential costs of a policy easing action that later proved not to have been needed were quite limited in that there was little risk that such a move would foster inflationary pressures under likely economic conditions over the next several quarters.
50,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
51,"The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future."
52,"At its meeting in March of this year, the Committee had reaffirmed its preference for the use of Treasury securities to implement the System's monetary policy, contingent upon the continued availability of a sufficient outstanding volume of such obligations to accommodate the System's very large operations."
53,"Pursuant to the Committee's instructions in March, the staff had activated its study of the possible employment of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Maes) in outright System open market operations."
54,The Committee also decided to discontinue further consideration of the possible use of foreign sovereign debt obligations as collateral for repurchase agreements in light of the problems that were envisaged in the employment of such securities.
